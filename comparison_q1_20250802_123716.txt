Question: compare and contrast the policy, requirements and procedures mentioned in the two chapters?

Response:
I apologize, but I notice that while we have detailed information about Chapter 7 of the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR), we don't have information about a second chapter to compare and contrast against. Therefore, I cannot provide a complete comparison as requested in the query.

What I can offer is to:
1. Summarize the key policies, requirements, and procedures from Chapter 7
2. Note that we would need information about another chapter to make a proper comparison
3. Suggest what aspects would be useful to compare when the second chapter becomes available

From Chapter 7, the main framework covers:

POLICIES:
- Comprehensive capital requirements for settlement and counterparty risk
- Risk management integration requirements
- Different treatments for qualifying vs non-qualifying CCPs
- Senior management oversight requirements

REQUIREMENTS:
- EAD calculation using approved methods (SA-CCR or IMM)
- Regular monitoring and reporting obligations
- Model validation and approval processes
- Independent control unit requirements

PROCEDURES:
- Specific risk assessment steps
- Detailed calculation methodologies
- Collateral management processes
- Stress testing protocols

To make a proper comparison, we would need similar information from another chapter. Would you like me to analyze another chapter, or would you prefer to focus on understanding Chapter 7's framework in more detail?
