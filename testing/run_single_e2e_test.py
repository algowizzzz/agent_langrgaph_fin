## Section 1: Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our world. This document outlines a framework for developing AI in a responsible and ethical manner. Our approach is built on fairness, accountability, and transparency. The regulatory landscape is evolving.

## Section 2: Core Principles
### Subsection 2.1: Fairness
AI systems must be designed to be impartial and avoid unfair bias. This is a complex challenge with no simple solution.

### Subsection 2.2: Accountability
There must be clear lines of responsibility for AI systems. This includes addressing any errors or unintended consequences. The grammar in this section could be improved.

### Subsection 2.3: Transparency
The decision-making processes of AI systems should be understandable to users and stakeholders. This is often called 'explainability'. A key risk is 'wrong-way risk', where a model's predictions are negatively correlated with outcomes.

## Section 3: Governance
We will establish an internal review board to oversee all AI projects. This ensures compliance with our ethical framework and with all relevant regulations.
