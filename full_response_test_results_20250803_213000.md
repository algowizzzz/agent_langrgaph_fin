**Focus:** Full Response Content from Core Functionality Tests

## Test 1: Document Q&A

### Query Details
- **Query:** "What types of financial risk are mentioned in the document?"
- **Documents:** 1 file (riskandfinace.pdf)
- **Workflow:** Document Analysis → Single Document Search → Response Synthesis

### Execution Summary
- **Status:** ✅ SUCCESS
- **Confidence:** 0.950
- **Response Length:** 1,126 chars
- **Tools Used:** `search_uploaded_docs` → `synthesize_content`

### Complete Response
```
Based on the document, there are four main types of financial risk mentioned:

1. Market Risk
- Related to price fluctuations in financial markets
- Involves uncertainty due to market volatility

2. Credit Risk
- Associated with potential defaults on loans
- Concerns the possibility of borrowers failing to meet their obligations

3. Liquidity Risk
- Connected to the inability to convert assets to cash
- Involves challenges in maintaining adequate cash flow or easily convertible assets

4. Operational Risk
- Linked to failures in processes or systems
- Relates to internal operational challenges within an organization

The document frames these risks within the broader context of finance, noting that risk in general refers to uncertainty or potential for loss in financial decisions or investments. These risks are quantifiable and can be measured by analyzing both the likelihood and magnitude of deviations from expected outcomes.

This classification provides a comprehensive overview of the main risk categories that financial professionals need to consider when making financial decisions or managing investments.

### Complete Response
```
Portfolio diversification is an investment strategy that involves spreading your investments across different asset types, sectors, and geographic regions to reduce overall investment risk. It's based on the fundamental principle of "not putting all your eggs in one basket."

Here's why diversification is important:

1. Risk Management
- Reduces the risk of major losses from any single investment
- Smooths out portfolio performance over time
- Provides better risk-adjusted returns by balancing potential risks and rewards
- Helps protect your overall investment portfolio from significant market downturns

2. Market Protection
- Different investments tend to perform differently under various market conditions
- When one asset class or sector struggles, others may perform well, helping to offset losses
- Provides a buffer against market volatility and economic uncertainties

The key to effective diversification is selecting investments that react differently to market conditions. This might include:
- Different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate)
- Various industry sectors
- Geographic diversity (domestic and international investments)
- Different investment sizes and risk levels

By diversifying your portfolio, you create a more resilient investment strategy that can help you achieve your financial goals while managing risk appropriately. It's considered one of the most fundamental and important principles of sound investing.

```
Based on the analysis of the two documents, here are the key differences between Chapters 1 and 7 of the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guidelines:

1. Purpose and Scope
- Chapter 1 serves as an introductory overview of risk-based capital requirements, establishing the fundamental framework for capital adequacy in financial institutions
- Chapter 7 is more specialized, focusing specifically on settlement and counterparty risk calculations and requirements

2. Technical Depth
- Chapter 1 takes a high-level, strategic approach, covering broad concepts like:
  * Basic capital ratios
  * Capital buffers
  * General regulatory requirements
- Chapter 7 is considerably more technical, containing:
  * Detailed mathematical formulas
  * Specific calculation methodologies for counterparty exposures
  * Complex risk assessment procedures

3. Core Components
Chapter 1 addresses foundational elements such as:
- Minimum capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital)
- Capital conservation buffer
- Countercyclical buffer
- D-SIB surcharge
- Domestic stability buffer

Chapter 7 focuses on specialized risk calculations and includes:
- Settlement risk calculations
- Counterparty exposure methodologies
- Specific technical requirements for risk assessment

These documents serve complementary but distinct purposes within the overall capital adequacy framework - Chapter 1 providing the foundational understanding and Chapter 7 offering detailed technical guidance for specific risk calculations.
```

### Analysis

# 🧠 **You're Absolutely Right! Token-Based Processing is Critical**

Currently, the system **blindly processes ANY size document** with a single LLM call, which causes:

❌ **Context window overflow** (>200K tokens)  
❌ **Poor quality synthesis** (too much content to process effectively)  
❌ **API errors** when hitting token limits  
❌ **Missed important details** in large documents

Let me show you the **current problem** and **exactly how to implement your 100K token decision logic**:

---

## 🔍 **Current Problem: No Token Awareness**

```python
# Current synthesis_tools.py - Lines 295-298
# 🚨 PROBLEM: Always single LLM call regardless of size
try:
    synthesis_result = await llm_with_retry(prompt)  # 🔥 Can be 500K+ tokens!
except Exception as e:
    return SynthesisError.create_error(...)
```

**The system currently has:**
- ✅ Chunking: 25K characters (~5K words)  
- ❌ **NO token counting**
- ❌ **NO size-based processing decisions**
- ❌ **NO refine method for large documents**

---

## 🛠 **Implementation Plan: Smart Token-Based Processing**

### **Step 1: Add Token Counting Utility**

```python
# NEW: tools/token_utils.py
import tiktoken
from typing import List, Dict
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Claude 3.5 Sonnet uses similar tokenization to GPT-4
ENCODING_NAME = "cl100k_base"
TOKEN_LIMIT_SINGLE_PASS = 100_000  # Your suggested 100K threshold
MAX_CONTEXT_WINDOW = 150_000      # Safe buffer under Claude's 200K limit

def count_tokens(text: str) -> int:
    """Count tokens in text using Claude-compatible encoding."""
    try:
        encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding(ENCODING_NAME)
        return len(encoding.encode(text))
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Token counting failed: {e}, using character estimate")
        # Fallback: ~4 chars per token (OpenAI rule of thumb)
        return len(text) // 4

            content = doc.get('content', '') or doc.get('page_content', '') or str(doc)
        else:
            content = str(doc)
        content_tokens += count_tokens(content)
    
    # Estimate prompt overhead (instructions, formatting, etc.)
    query_tokens = count_tokens(query)
    
    # Different synthesis types have different prompt overhead
    prompt_overhead = {
        "analysis": 500,        # Detailed 5-point analysis prompt
        "summary": 400,         # Summary prompt
        "financial_comparison": 600,  # Comparison with multi-doc formatting
        "comparison": 600,
        "default": 300
    }.get(synthesis_type, 300)
    
    total_estimated = content_tokens + query_tokens + prompt_overhead

## 🎯 **How the New System Works**

### **Flow Diagram:**
```
📄 Documents + Query
     ↓
🧮 Count Total Tokens
     ↓
❓ > 100K tokens?
     ↓
  ✅ YES → 🔄 REFINE METHOD
  ❌ NO  → 📝 SINGLE PASS
```

### **Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Small Document (≤100K tokens)**
```
Documents: [Single 50-page PDF]
Estimated Tokens: 75,000
Decision: Single-pass synthesis ✅
Result: Current behavior (fast, direct)
```

**Scenario 2: Large Document (>100K tokens)**
```
Documents: [Multiple large PDFs, 400 pages total]
Estimated Tokens: 180,000
Decision: Refine method 🔄
Process:
  1. Chunk into 3 groups (50K tokens each)
  2. Initial synthesis with Chunk 1
  3. Refine with Chunk 2 
  4. Refine with Chunk 3
  5. Final comprehensive result
```

---

## 📋 **Implementation Steps**

1. **Install tiktoken**: `pip install tiktoken`
2. **Create `tools/token_utils.py`** with token counting functions
3. **Update `tools/synthesis_tools.py`** to add decision logic
4. **Update `config.py`** to add token limits:
   ```python
   class AI:
       # ... existing ...
       self.token_limit_single_pass = 100_000
       self.max_context_window = 150_000
   ```
5. **Test with large documents** to verify refine method works

---

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Approach**

✅ **Intelligent Processing**: Right method for document size  
✅ **Quality Improvement**: Better synthesis for large documents  
✅ **Error Prevention**: No more context window overflows  
✅ **Cost Optimization**: Efficient token usage  
✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Small docs work exactly the same
