## üîß **Technical Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Critical Bug Resolution**
**Issue**: Document Analysis Pod complete failure (HTTP 500 errors)
**Root Causes Identified**:
- Pydantic model attribute access using `.get()` instead of direct attributes
- Duplicate `.isoformat()` calls causing JSON serialization errors
- LangChain OpenAI dependency missing

**Fixes Applied**:
```python
# Fixed Pydantic model access
info.role == "Content"  # instead of info.get("role")
file_info.id  # instead of file_info.get("id")

# Fixed JSON timestamp serialization  
timestamp=datetime.now().isoformat()  # removed duplicate .isoformat()

# Installed missing dependency
pip install langchain-openai
```
