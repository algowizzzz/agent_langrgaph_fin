It encompasses activities such as budgeting, saving, investing, borrowing, and\nforecasting to ensure the e\ufb03cient allocation of resources. Finance is broadly categorized\ninto three areas: personal \ufb01nance (managing individual or household \ufb01nances), corporate\n\ufb01nance (managing business \ufb01nances), and public \ufb01nance (managing government revenues\nand expenditures). The primary goal of \ufb01nance is to maximize value while balancing liq-\nuidity and pro\ufb01tability.\nWhat is Risk?\nRisk refers to the uncertainty or potential for loss in \ufb01nancial decisions or investments.\nIt arises from factors such as market volatility, economic changes, or unforeseen events.\nIn \ufb01nance, risk is often measured by the likelihood and magnitude of deviations from\nexpected outcomes. Common types of \ufb01nancial risk include market risk (price \ufb02uctua-\ntions), credit risk (default on loans), liquidity risk (inability to convert assets to cash),\nand operational risk (failures in processes or systems).\nThe Relationship Between Finance and Risk\nFinance and risk are inherently linked, as \ufb01nancial decisions involve weighing potential\nreturns against uncertainties. E\ufb00ective \ufb01nancial management requires assessing and mit-\nigating risks through strategies like diversi\ufb01cation, hedging, or insurance. Understanding\nrisk enables individuals and organizations to make informed decisions, optimize returns,\nand safeguard their \ufb01nancial stability.\nFor more information, explore resources at Investopedia or consult a \ufb01nancial advisor.\n1",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the\nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be\nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and\n\u2022 own-use property, plant and equipment\n12.

The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents\nbooked in Canada.",

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take\naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate.

Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when  \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (\u201cFISC\u201d), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions.

In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68.

The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In\nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between\nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions\u2019 ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB\nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",

This chapter is drawn from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Basel\nframework, published on the BIS website,1 effective December 15, 2019. For reference, the\nBasel paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are indicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph .\n2  \n7.1. Treatment of counterparty credit risk and cross -product netting\n2. This rule identifies permissible methods for estimating the Exposure at Default (EAD)\nor the exposure amount for instruments with counterparty credit risk under this guideline.\n3\nInstitutions may seek OSFI approval to make use of an Internal Modelling Method (IMM) meeting the requirements and specifications identified herein. As an alternative institutions may also use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA- CCR).  [Basel Framework,\nCRE 53.1]\n7.1.1 Definitions and general terminology\n3. This section defines terms that will be used throughout this chapter.  \n7.1.1.1 General terms  \n\u2022 Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR)  is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could\ndefault before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss would occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default. Unlike an institution\u2019s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending institution faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of the transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The market value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying market factors.\n\u2022 A central counterparty  (CCP) is a clearing house that interposes itself between\ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance of open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants through novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the purposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.\n\u2022 A qualifying central counterparty  (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as  a\nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted by the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products  \n1    The Basel Framework\n2  Following the format: [Basel Framework XXX yy.zz].\n3 In this document, the terms \u201cexposure at default\u201d and \u201cexposure amount\u201d are used together in order to identify\nmeasures of exposure under both an internal ratings -based (IRB) and a standardi zed approach for credit risk.",

Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.\n\u2022 Peak Exposure  is a high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution of\nexposures at any particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction in the netting set. A peak exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.\n\u2022 Expected Exposure is the mean (average) of the distribution of exposures at any particular future date before the longest -maturity transaction in the netting set matures.\nAn expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the\nlongest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.\n\u2022 Effecti ve Expected Exposure at a specific date is the maximum expected exposure that\noccurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as\nthe greater of the expected exposur e at that date, or the effective exposure at the previous\ndate. In effect, the Effective Expected Exposure is the Expected Exposure that is constrained to be non- decreasing over time.\n\u2022 Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of exp ected\nexposures where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval. When calculating the minimum capital requirement,\nthe average is taken over the first year or, if all the contracts in the net ting set mature\nbefore one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract in the netting set.\n\u2022 Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE) is the weighted average over time of effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if al l the contracts in the\nnetting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract\nin the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval.\n\u2022 Credit Va luation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid -market valuation of the\nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the credit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. This a djustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the\nmarket value of the credit risk of both the institution and the counterparty.\n\u2022 One-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects\nthe mar ket value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does not reflect the\nmarket value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty.\n\u2022 Debit Valuation Adjustment  is a valuation adjustment that reflects the market value of\nthe credit  risk of the institution to the counterparty (i.e. changes in the reporting\ninstitution\u2019s own credit risk), but does not reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution.

This method is to be used for exposures arising from OTC\nderivatives, exchange -traded derivatives and long settlement transactions. This method must be\nused if the bank does not have approval to use the internal model method (IMM).\n(2) The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of collateral, which are\nboth set out in the credit risk mitigation section  of the standardi zed approach to credit risk (see\nChapter 4, section 4.3).

A qualifying internal model for measuring counterparty credit exposure must\nspecify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to changes in market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, etc. The model then computes the firm\u2019s CCR exposure for the netting set at each future date given the changes in the market variables. For margined counterparties, the model may also captur e future collateral\nmovements. Institutions may include eligible financial collateral as defined in section 4.3.3 and Chapter 9  in their forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set, if\nthe quantitative, qualitative and data  requirements for internal model method are met for the\ncollateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.6]\n21. To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk for exposures\nsubject to the IMM, institutions must use the greater of the portfolio- level capital charge (not\nincluding the CVA charge in Chapter 8) based on Effective EPE using current market data and the portfolio- level capital charge based on Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress\ncalibration should be a single consistent  stress calibration for the whole portfolio of\ncounterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration should be applied on a total portfolio level and not on a counterparty by counterparty basis. [Basel Framework,  CRE 53.7]\n22. OSFI expects institutions to have in place a policy for verifying the adequacy of, and\nupdating, their choice of stress period. This policy would have to be approved in advance by OSFI as part of the IMM model approval process. Changes to this policy would constitute a major modification of the IMM model .\n23. To the extent that an institution recogni zes collateral in exposure amount or EAD via\ncurrent exposure, an institution would not be permitted to recogni ze the benefits in its estimates\nof LGD.  As a result, the institution would be required to use an LGD of an otherwise similar\nuncollaterali zed facility.

If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the internal model captures the\neffects of margining when estimating EE, the model\u2019s EE measure may be used directly in equation (2). Such models are noticeably more complicated than models of EPE for unmargined counterparties. As such, they are subject to a higher degree of supervisory scrutiny before they are approved, as discussed below.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.22]  39. An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to capture the\neffects of margining. It must take into account both the current amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model must account for the nature of margin agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model mus t either model the mark -to-market change in the\nvalue of collateral posted or apply this guideline\u2019s rules for collateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.23]  40. For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark- to-market valuation, a\nsupervisory floor of five business days for netting sets consisting only of repo-style transactions, and 10 business days for all other netting sets is imposed on the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling EAD with margin agreements. In the following cases a higher supervisory floor is imposed:  \n11  Conceptually, M equals the effective credit duration of the counterparty exposure.

The internal model used to generate the distribution of exposures must be part of a\ncounterparty risk management framework that includes the identification, measurement,\nmanagement, approval and internal reporting of counterparty risk.\n13 This framework must\ninclude the measurement of usage of credit lines (aggregating counterparty exposures with other\ncredit exposure s) and economic capital allocation. In addition to EPE (a measure of future\nexposure), an institution must measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the institution must measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held.

For example, an institution may compute EE on a daily basis for the first 10 days, once a week out to one month, once a  month out to 18 months, once a quarter out\nto five years and beyond five years in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposure.

An institution must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the\nassessment of capital adequacy.

Stress testing must also involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on a firm\u2019s credit exposures and assessment of the firm\u2019s ability to withstand such changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are; (i) economic or industry downturns, (ii) market -place events, or (iii) decreased liquid ity conditions.\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.45]\n63.

Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify risk factors that are positively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness. Such testi ng needs to address the\npossibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed.\nInstitutions should monitor general wrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by\nother categories that are germane to the busin ess. Reports should be provided to senior\nmanagement on a regular basis that communicate wrong way risks and the steps that are being taken to manage that risk.  [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.47]\n65. An institution is exposed to \u201cspecific wrong- way risk\u201d (SWWR) if  future exposure to a\nspecific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty\u2019s probability of default. For example, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong -way exposures for the\nbuyer that is specific to the counterparty. An institution must have procedures in place to identify, monitor and control cases of SWWR, beginning at the inception of a trade and continuing through the life of the trade. To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single -name credit de fault swaps\nwhere there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals the full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the underlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the underlying instrument allows the institution to recogni ze, in respect of such swap, the market\nvalue that has been lost a lready and any expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for Advanced or\nFoundation IRB institutions must be set to 100% for such swap transactions .\n14 For institutions\nusing the s tandardi zed approach for credit risk, the risk weight to use is that of an unsecured\ntransaction. For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. referencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying company, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD equals the value of the transaction under the assumption of a jump- to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this\nmakes re- use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC)  that already contain an\nLGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%. LGD for Advanced and Foundation IRB banks will be that of an unsecured exposure. For institutions using the s tandardized a pproach for credit\nrisk, the risk weight of an unsecured transac tion should be used.  \nThe counterparty credit risk arising from trades where SWWR has been identified can be\nmitigated through either prepayment or the collection of independent collateral amounts.

There are two formulations of replacement cost de pending on whether the trades with a\ncounterparty are subject to a margin agreement. Where a margin agreement exists, the formulation could apply both to bilateral transactions and central clearing relationships. The formulation also addresses the various arrangements that an institution may have to post and/or receive collateral that may be referred to as initial margin. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.9]\nA. Formulation for unmargined transactions\n105. For unmargined transactions (that is, where VM is not exchanged, but collateral other\nthan VM may be present), RC is defined as the greater of: (i) the current market value of the derivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by the institution (if any ), and (ii) zero. This is\nconsistent with the use of replacement cost as the measure of current exposure, meaning that when the institution owes the counterparty money it has no exposure to the counterparty if it can instantly replace its trades and sell c ollateral at current market prices. Mathematically:\nRC = max{ V-C,0}\nwhere V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set and C is the haircut value of net collateral held, which is calculated in accordance with the NICA methodology defined in paragraph 112. For this purpose , the value of non- cash collateral posted by the institution to its\ncounterparty is increased and the value of the non- cash collateral received by the institution from\nits counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same as those that apply to repo -style\ntransactions) for the time periods described in paragraph 100.\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.10 and 52.11]\n106. In the above formulation, it is assumed that the replacement cost representing today\u2019s\nexposure to the counterparty cannot go less than zero. However, institutions sometimes hold excess collateral (even in the absence of a margin agreement) or have out -of-the-money trades\nwhich can further protect the institution from the increase of the exposure. As discussed in paragraphs 116 to 118, the SA -CCR would allow such over -collaterali zation and negative mark-  \n22  Thus, if any of these supervisors is dissatisfied about enforceability under its laws, the netting contract or\nagreement will not meet this condition and neither counterparty could obtain supervisory benefit.",

ICA can\nchange in response to factors such as the value of the collateral or a change in the number of transactions in the netting set. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.16]\n112.

For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g., multi- asset or\nhybrid derivatives), institutions m ust take sensitivities and volatility of the underlying into\naccount for determining the primary risk driver.\nOSFI may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one asset class,\nresulting in the same position being included in multiple  classes. In this case, for each asset class\nto which the position is allocated, institutions must determine appropriately the sign and delta\nadjustment of the relevant risk driver.\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.27 and 52.28]  \n7.1.7.6 General steps for calculating the add- on  \n122. For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and\nattributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity or commodity. The add- on for each asset class is calculated usin g asset -class -specific formulas\nthat represent a styli zed Effective EPE calculation under the assumption that all trades in the\nasset class have zero current mark -to-market value (i.e. they are at -the-money). [ Basel\nFramework, CRE 52.29]\n123. Although the add -on formulas are asset class -specific, they have a number of features in\ncommon. To determine the add- on, transactions in each asset class are subject to adjustment in\nthe following general steps:\n1) The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each individual trade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the sensitivity of the trade to movements in the underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, exchange rates, credit spreads, e quity prices and commodity prices). The effective notional is calculated as the\nproduct of the following parameters (i.e. D = d \u00d7  MF \u00d7  \u03b4):\na. The adjustment notional (d) . The adjusted notional is a measure of the size of\nthe trade. For derivatives in the fore ign exchange asset class this is simply the\nnotional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative contracted, converted to the domestic currency. For derivatives in the equity and commodity asset classes, it is simply the current price of the releva nt share or unit of commodity\nmultiplied by the number of shares/units that the derivative references. For derivatives in the interest rate and credit asset classes, the notional amount is adjusted by a measure of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that the value of the instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to movements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads).\nb. The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes account of the  time period over which the potential future exposure is calculated. The\ncalculation of the maturity factor varies depending on whether the netting set is margined or unmargined.\nc. The supervisory delta (\u03b4). The supervisory delta ensures the effective notional takes into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, by having a positive or negative sign. It is also takes into account whether the",

The\nsupervisory factor is the supervisory specified change in value of the underlying risk\nfactor on which t he potential future exposure calculation is based, which has been\ncalibrated to take into account the volatility of underlying risk factors.\n3) The trades within each asset class are separated into supervisory specified hedging sets. The purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where long and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the potential future exposure.\n4) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory\nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset -class level to give\nthe asset class level add -on. The method of aggregation varies between assets classes and\nfor credit, equity and commodity derivatives.

This time period appears in the maturity factor defined in paragraphs 139 to 144 that scales down adjusted notional for unmargine d trades for all asset classes. If a derivative contract has another derivative\ncontract as its underlying (for example, a swaption) and may be physically exercised into the underlying contract (i.e., an institution would assume a position in the underlying contract in the event of exercise), then maturity of the contract is the time period until the final settlement date of the underlying derivative contract.\n\u2022 For interest rate and credit derivatives,  S\ni is the period of time (starting today) until the\nstart of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract. If the derivative references the value of another interest rate or credit instrument (e.g., swaption or bond option), the time period must be determined on the basis of the underlying instrument. S\ni\nappears in the definition of supervisory duration defined in paragraph 126.\n\u2022 For interest rate and credit derivatives, E i is the period of time (starting today) until the\nend of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract. If the derivative references the value of another interest rate or credit instrument (e .g., swaption or bond\noption), the time period must be determined on the basis of the underlying instrument.\nEi\nappears in the definition of supervisory duration defined in paragraph 126. In addition, Ei\nis used for allocating derivatives in the interest rate asset class to maturity buckets, which are used in the calculation of the add -on (see paragraph\n146).For options in all asset\nclasses, T i is the time period (starting today) until the latest contractual exercise date as\nreferenced by the contr act.

In many cases the trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity.

The averaging described in this paragraph does\nnot cover transactions where the notional varies due to price changes (typically FX,\nequity and commodity derivatives).\n\u2022 Leveraged swaps must be converted to the not ional of the equivalent unleveraged swap,\nthat is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated notional must be multiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the trade notional amount.\n\u2022 For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is multiplied by the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to determine the trade notional amount.\n\u2022 For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the\nremaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \n26  There is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining maturity of the\nderivative contract.

For the purposes of effective notional calculations (i.e. D = d \u00d7 MF \u00d7 \u03b4), single -\npayment options  must be treated as follows:  \n\u2022 For European, Asian, American and Bermudan put and call options, the supervisory delta\nmust be calculated using the simplified Black -Scholes formula in paragraph 133. In the\ncase of Asian options, the underlying price must be set equal to the current value of the average used in the payoff. In the case of American and Bermudan options, the latest\nallowed exercise date must be used as the exercise date\niT in the formula.\nFor Bermudan swaptions, the start date iS must be equal to the earliest allowed exercise\ndate, while the end date iE must be equal to the end date of the underlying swap.\n\u2022 For digital options (also known as binary options), the payoff of each digital option (bought or sold) with strike\niK must be approximated via the \u201ccollar\u201d combination of\nbought and sold European options of the same type (call or put) with the strikes set equal to\n0.95iK\u22c5 and 1.05iK\u22c5. The size of the position in the collar components must be such\nthat the digital payoff is reproduced exactly outside of the region between the two strikes.\nThe effective notional is then computed for the bought and sold European components of the collar separately, using the option formulas for the supervisory delta in paragraph 132\n(the exercise date\niT and the current value of the underlying iP of the digital option must\nbe used). The absolute value of the digital option effective notional must be capped by the\nratio of the digital payoff to the relevant supervisory factor.\n\u2022 If a trade\u2019s payoff can be represented as a combination of European option payoffs (e.g. collar, butterfly/calendar spread, straddle, strangle, etc.), each European option component must be treated as a separate trade.\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.42]  \n\u2022\nFor the purposes of effective notional calculations, multi -payment options must be represented\nas a combination of single-payment options.

This allocation of derivatives to maturity buckets and the process of aggre gation are only used in the interest rate derivative asset class.[ Basel Framework, CRE\n52.56]\n147.

The is calculated as the product of the following three terms (i) the\nadjusted notional of the trade (d); (ii) the supervisory delta adjustment of the trade ( \u03b4); and (iii)\nthe maturity factor  (MF). That is, for each trade i, D\ni = d i x \u03b4 i x MF i.\n(2) Step 2: Allocate the trades in the interest rate derivative asset class to hedging sets. In the interest rate derivative asset class the hedging sets consist of all the derivatives that reference th e\nsame currency.\n(3) Step 3: Within each hedging set, allocate each of the trades to the following three maturity\nbuckets: less than one year (bucket 1), between one  and five years (bucket 2) and more than five\nyears (bucket 3).\n(4) Step 4: Calculate the effective notional of each maturity bucket by adding together all the\ntrade- level effective notionals calculated in step 1 of the trades within the maturity bucket.

The formula to recognized partial offsetting in step 4 above, is a single -factor model,\nwhich divides the risk of the cre dit derivative asset class into a systemic component and an\nidiosyncratic component. The entity level add- ons are allowed to offset each other fully in the\nsystemic component, whereas, there is no offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component.\nThese tw o components are weighted by a correlation factor which determines the degree of\noffsetting/hedging benefit within the credit derivative asset class. The higher the correlation factor, the higher the importance of the systemic component, hence the higher t he degree of\noffsetting benefits. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.62]\n153. It should be noted that a higher or lower correlation does not necessarily mean a higher\nor lower capital charge. For portfolios consisting of long and short credit positions, a high correlation factor would reduce the charge. For portfolios consisting exclusively of long positions (or short positions), a higher correlation factor would increase the charge. If most of the risk consists of systematic risk, then individual reference enti ties would be highly correlated and\nlong and short positions should offset each other. If, however, most of the risk is idiosyncratic to a reference entity, then individual long and short positions would not be effective hedges for each other. [ Basel Frame work, CRE 52.63]\n154. The use of a single hedging set for credit derivatives implies that credit derivatives from\ndifferent industries and regions are equally able to offset the systematic component of an exposure, although they would not be able to offset the idiosyncratic portion. This approach recogni zes that meaningful distinctions between industries and/or regions are complex and\ndifficult to analy ze for global conglomerates.

The calculation of the add -on for the equity derivative asset class is very similar to the\ncalculation of the add -on for the credit derivative asset class. It only gives full recognition of the\noffsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that re ference the same entity (e.g. , the same\ncorporate issuer of shares). Partial offsetting is recogni zed between derivatives that reference\ndifferent entities in step 4 below.  [Basel Framework CRE 52.65]\n156.

The calibration of the supervisory factors for equity derivatives rely on estimates of the\nmarket volatility of equity indices, with the application of a conservative beta factor38 to translate\nthis estimate into an estimate of individual volatilities.[Basel Framework, CRE 52.67]\n158.  Institutions are not permitted to make any modelling assumptions in the calculation of\nthe PFE add -ons, including estimating individual volatiliti es or taking publicly available\nestimates of beta. This is a pragmatic approach to ensure a consistent implementation across\njurisdictions but also to keep the add -on calculation relatively simple and prudent. Therefore,\nonly two values of supervisory fact ors have been defined for equity derivatives, one for single\nentities and one for indices.  \n38 The beta of an individual equity measures the volatility of the stock relative to a broad market index. A value of\nbeta greater than one means the individual equity is more volatile than the index. The greater the beta is, the\nmore volatile the stock. The beta is calculated by running a linear regression of the stock on the broad index.",

The calculation  of the add -on for the commodity derivative asset class is similar to the\ncalculation of the add -on for the credit and equity derivative asset classes. It recognizes the full\noffsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that reference the same type of underlying\ncommodity. It also allows partial offsetting between derivatives that reference different types of\ncommodity, however, this partial offsetting is only permitted within each of the four hedging sets\nof the commodity derivative asset class, where the different commodity types are more likely to demonstrate some stable, meaningful joint dynamics.

For example crude oil could be a commodity\ntype within the energy hedging set, but in certain cases this definition could omit a substantial\nbasis risk bet ween different types of crude oil (West Texas Intermediate, Brent, Saudi Light, etc).\nAlso, the four commodity type hedging sets have been defined without regard to characteristics\nsuch as location and quality. For example, the energy hedging set contains commodity types such\nas crude oil, electricity, natural gas and coal. OSFI may require banks to use more refined definitions of commodities when they are significantly exposed to the basis risk of different\nproducts within those commodity types.

Transactions settled through a delivery- versus -payment system (DvP) ,48 providing\nsimultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose firms to a risk of loss on the difference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the transaction valued at\ncurrent market price (i.e. , positive current exposure). Transactions where cash is paid without\nreceipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, foreign currencies, gold, or commodities) or,\nconversely, deliverables were delivered without receipt of the corresponding cash payment (non -\nDvP, or free -delivery) expose firms to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or\ndeliverables delivered. The current rules set out specific capital charges that address these two\nkinds of exposures.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.3 and 70.4]\n213. The following capital treatment is applicable to all transactions on securities, foreign\nexchange instruments, and commodities that give rise to a risk of delayed settlement or delivery.\nThis includes transactions through recogni zed clearing houses and central counterparties that are\nsubject to daily mark -to-market and payment of daily variation margins and that involve a\nmismatched trade .\n49 The treatment does not apply to the instruments that are subject to the\ncounterparty credit risk requirements set out in section 7.1 or the credit risk mitigation section of\nchapter 4 of this guideline (i.e. over -the-counter derivatives, exchange -traded derivatives, long\nsettlement transactions, securities financing transa ctions).[ Basel Framework, CRE 70.5]\n214. In cases of a system wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central\ncounterparty, a national supervisor may use its discretion to waive capital charges until the situation is rectified. [BCBS June 2006 Annex 3 par 4] and [Basel Framework, CRE 70.7]\n215. Failure of a counterparty to settle a trade in itself will not be deemed a default for\npurposes of credit risk under this guideline.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.8]\n216. In applying a risk weight to failed free -delivery exposures, institutions using the IRB\napproach for credit risk may assign PDs to counterparties for which they have no other banking book exposure on the basis of the counterparty\u2019s external rating. Institutions using the Advanced IRB approach may use a 45 % LGD in lieu of estimating LGDs so long as they apply it to all\nfailed trade exposures. Alternatively, institutions using the IRB approach may opt to apply the standardi zed approach risk weights or a 100% risk weight.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.10]  \n48  For the purpose of this guideline, DvP transactions include payment -versus -payment (PvP) transactions.\n49  An expos ure value of zero for counterparty credit risk can be attributed to payment transactions (e.g. funds\ntransfer transactions) and other spot transactions that are outstanding with a central counterparty (e.g. a clearing\nhouse), when the central counterparty CCR exposures with all participants in its arrangements are fully\ncollateraliz ed on a daily basis.",

Similarly, institutions under the standardi zed approach will use the s tandardi zed\nrisk weights set forth in this guideline. However, when exposures are not material, institutions\nmay choose to apply a uniform 100% risk- weight to these exposures, in order to avoid the\nburden of a full credit assessment. If five business days after the second contractual payment/delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the institution that has\nmade the first payment leg will deduct from capital the full amount of the value transferred plus\nreplacement cost, if any. This  treatment will apply until the second payment/delivery leg is\neffectively made.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.4]  \n50  If the dates when two payment legs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is\nmade, it is deemed that they are settled on the same day.

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the\nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be\nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and\n\u2022 own-use property, plant and equipment\n12.

The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents\nbooked in Canada.",

Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.\n22.

An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5.

The adjusted capital requirement is based on application of all of the chapters of this\nguideline and is equal to the net total of the following amounts:\ni. total risk -weighted assets, plus\nii. 12.5 times the provisioning shortfall deduction, less\niii. 12.5 times excess provisions included in Tier 2, less\niv. 12.5 times the amount of general allowances that may be recognized in Tier 2 in respect of exposures for which the standardized approach is used.\n37.

Calculation of OSFI Minimum Capital Requirements\n1.6.1. Risk -Based Capital Ratios for D-SIBs and Category I and II SMSBs\n38. Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for\nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for\nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets\nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:\nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\nWhere:\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2.\nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7.\n39. Table 2 provides the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios for institutions\nbefore application of the capital conservation buffer.  \n11  There are two exceptions to this rule. One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are\ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in\nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the\nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so. Both of these\nexceptions expire when the revised CVA framework is implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2024.",

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

[Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must\nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements. In addition, when disclosing their buffers, if any, institutions must also disclose the geographic breakdown of their private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer.

OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of\nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1%\nof RWAs.

Domestic Stability Buffer\n67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI\u2019s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with\nCET1 c apital.\n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI\u2019s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.  \n32   Details related to the OSFI\u2019s DSB are included on OSFI\u2019s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions",

Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS).  \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n72.

Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB\nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate\ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic\npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the\nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

To give\ninstitutions time to adjust to a buffer level, OSFI will pre -announce its decision, to activate or\nraise the level of the countercyclical buffer, by up to 12 months but no less than 6 months. Conversely, decisions to release the countercyclical buffer will normally take effect immediately. Institutions with foreign exposures are expected to match host jurisdictions\u2019 implementation\ntimelines unless the announcement per iod is shorter than 6 months in which case compliance will\nonly be required 6 months after the host\u2019s announcement .\n27 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.11]  \n64. The maximum countercyclical buffer relating to foreign private sector credit exposures\nwill be 2.5% of total  RWAs .28 Jurisdictions may choose to implement a buffer in excess of 2.5%,\nif deemed appropriate in their national context; in such cases the international reciprocity\nprovisions will not apply to the additional amounts. In addition, institutions are not e xpected to\nreplicate sectoral buffers or similar measures adopted by foreign jurisdictions that depart from\nthe internationally agreed countercyclical buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must\nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements. In addition, when disclosing their buffers, if any, institutions must also disclose the geographic breakdown of their private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.19]  \n1. 8. Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) Surcharge\n65. OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of\nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1%\nof RWAs. The 1% capital surcharge will be periodically reviewed in light of national and international developments . This is consistent with the levels and timing set out in the BCBS D -\nSIB framework. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.7 to 40.23]\n66. The 1% surcharge will be implemented through an extension of the capital conservation\nbuffer. This is in line with the tre atment of the higher loss absorbency requirement for global\nsystemically important banks (G -SIBs) prescribed by the BCBS .\n30 Table 7 below sets out the\nminimum capital conservation ratios a D -SIB must meet at various CET1 capital ratios  and Tier\n1 leverage ratio s.31 D-SIBs will thus be subject to a pre -determined set of restrictions on the  \n25  The Superintendent will consider factors such as whether an institution\u2019s business model involves providing\ncredit through intermediation of funds or whether  the conditions that give rise to financial system -wide issues are\nexplicitly addressed in a robust manner in the institution\u2019s internal capital targets.\n26   The countercyclical buffer is to be computed and applied at the consolidated FRFI parent level, i. e. OSFI\nregulated deposit -taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit -taking institution are not\nsubject to the countercyclical buffer.\n27   The pre -announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.\n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA\nOperational Risk ].\n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI\u2019s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs.\n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6\n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D -SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements.\nIn the event that a D -SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CE T1, 9.5% Tier\n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.",

In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI\u2019s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with\nCET1 c apital.\n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI\u2019s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.  \n32   Details related to the OSFI\u2019s DSB are included on OSFI\u2019s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions",

Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS).  \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale.

Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions\u2019 ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB\nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the\nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be\nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and\n\u2022 own-use property, plant and equipment\n12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported\nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:\n\u2022 the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and\n\u2022 accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a\nresult of subsequent revaluations\n13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents\nbooked in Canada.",

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23]  \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital\nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when  \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (\u201cFISC\u201d), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions.

[Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must\nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements.

D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process.\nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a\nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS).  \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In\nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between\nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions\u2019 ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB\nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the\nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be\nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and\n\u2022 own-use property, plant and equipment\n12.

The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents\nbooked in Canada.",

Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.\n22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a\nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting\nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\n8 Institutions that do not receive\napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23. An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n24.

To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based\ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty\ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA.

Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.\nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk,\ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:\ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and\nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2.\n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]\n28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the\ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline.

The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and\noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).

For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions.

If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions:\n(a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;\n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and\n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion\nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52.

The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take\naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed\nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide\nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential\nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements:\n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor\ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and\nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when  \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (\u201cFISC\u201d), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides informat ion that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national\nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures.

In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI\u2019s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with\nCET1 c apital.\n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan.

In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital.

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11.

Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents\nbooked in Canada.",

Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.\n22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a\nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime.

An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n24.

Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for\nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for\nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets\nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:\nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\nWhere:\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2.\nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7.\n39.

One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are\ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in\nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the\nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

Its membership is the same as the\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (\u201cFISC\u201d), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions.

[Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must\nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements. In addition, when disclosing their buffers, if any, institutions must also disclose the geographic breakdown of their private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer.

OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of\nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1%\nof RWAs.

In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with\nCET1 c apital.\n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan.

Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS).  \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements.

In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB\nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate\ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic\npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the\nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11.

The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

To give\ninstitutions time to adjust to a buffer level, OSFI will pre -announce its decision, to activate or\nraise the level of the countercyclical buffer, by up to 12 months but no less than 6 months. Conversely, decisions to release the countercyclical buffer will normally take effect immediately. Institutions with foreign exposures are expected to match host jurisdictions\u2019 implementation\ntimelines unless the announcement per iod is shorter than 6 months in which case compliance will\nonly be required 6 months after the host\u2019s announcement .\n27 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.11]  \n64. The maximum countercyclical buffer relating to foreign private sector credit exposures\nwill be 2.5% of total  RWAs .28 Jurisdictions may choose to implement a buffer in excess of 2.5%,\nif deemed appropriate in their national context; in such cases the international reciprocity\nprovisions will not apply to the additional amounts. In addition, institutions are not e xpected to\nreplicate sectoral buffers or similar measures adopted by foreign jurisdictions that depart from\nthe internationally agreed countercyclical buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must\nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements. In addition, when disclosing their buffers, if any, institutions must also disclose the geographic breakdown of their private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.19]  \n1. 8. Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) Surcharge\n65. OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of\nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1%\nof RWAs. The 1% capital surcharge will be periodically reviewed in light of national and international developments . This is consistent with the levels and timing set out in the BCBS D -\nSIB framework. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.7 to 40.23]\n66. The 1% surcharge will be implemented through an extension of the capital conservation\nbuffer. This is in line with the tre atment of the higher loss absorbency requirement for global\nsystemically important banks (G -SIBs) prescribed by the BCBS .\n30 Table 7 below sets out the\nminimum capital conservation ratios a D -SIB must meet at various CET1 capital ratios  and Tier\n1 leverage ratio s.31 D-SIBs will thus be subject to a pre -determined set of restrictions on the  \n25  The Superintendent will consider factors such as whether an institution\u2019s business model involves providing\ncredit through intermediation of funds or whether  the conditions that give rise to financial system -wide issues are\nexplicitly addressed in a robust manner in the institution\u2019s internal capital targets.\n26   The countercyclical buffer is to be computed and applied at the consolidated FRFI parent level, i. e. OSFI\nregulated deposit -taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit -taking institution are not\nsubject to the countercyclical buffer.\n27   The pre -announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.\n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA\nOperational Risk ].\n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI\u2019s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs.\n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6\n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D -SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements.\nIn the event that a D -SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CE T1, 9.5% Tier\n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.",

In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI\u2019s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with\nCET1 c apital.\n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI\u2019s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.  \n32   Details related to the OSFI\u2019s DSB are included on OSFI\u2019s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions",

D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process.\nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a\nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS).  \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale.

Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB\nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles.

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the\nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23]  \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital\nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when  \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (\u201cFISC\u201d), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions.

Domestic Stability Buffer\n67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI\u2019s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with\nCET1 c apital.\n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI\u2019s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.  \n32   Details related to the OSFI\u2019s DSB are included on OSFI\u2019s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions",

D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process.\nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a\nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS).  \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In\nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between\nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions\u2019 ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB\nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the\nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be\nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and\n\u2022 own-use property, plant and equipment\n12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported\nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:\n\u2022 the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and\n\u2022 accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a\nresult of subsequent revaluations\n13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents\nbooked in Canada.",

Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.\n22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a\nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting\nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\n8 Institutions that do not receive\napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23. An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n24.

To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based\ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty\ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital\nfloor ensures that institutions\u2019 capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set\nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.\nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk,\ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:\ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and\nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2.\n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]\n28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the\ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.\n1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and\noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:\ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less\nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital\nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline.",

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted.

It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take\naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate.

The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements:\n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor\ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and\nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when  \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (\u201cFISC\u201d), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides informat ion that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national\nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures.

In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with\nCET1 c apital.\n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan.

Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS).  \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n72.

Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital.

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11.

Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.\n22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a\nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime.

An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative\nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk\n25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative\nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor):\n\u2022 The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions\nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution.\n\u2022 On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions\n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions \u2013 Implemen tation Note",

Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for\nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for\nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets\nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:\nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\nWhere:\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2.\nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7.\n39.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted.

[Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

To give\ninstitutions time to adjust to a buffer level, OSFI will pre -announce its decision, to activate or\nraise the level of the countercyclical buffer, by up to 12 months but no less than 6 months. Conversely, decisions to release the countercyclical buffer will normally take effect immediately. Institutions with foreign exposures are expected to match host jurisdictions\u2019 implementation\ntimelines unless the announcement per iod is shorter than 6 months in which case compliance will\nonly be required 6 months after the host\u2019s announcement .\n27 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.11]  \n64. The maximum countercyclical buffer relating to foreign private sector credit exposures\nwill be 2.5% of total  RWAs .28 Jurisdictions may choose to implement a buffer in excess of 2.5%,\nif deemed appropriate in their national context; in such cases the international reciprocity\nprovisions will not apply to the additional amounts. In addition, institutions are not e xpected to\nreplicate sectoral buffers or similar measures adopted by foreign jurisdictions that depart from\nthe internationally agreed countercyclical buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must\nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements. In addition, when disclosing their buffers, if any, institutions must also disclose the geographic breakdown of their private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.19]  \n1. 8. Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) Surcharge\n65. OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of\nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1%\nof RWAs. The 1% capital surcharge will be periodically reviewed in light of national and international developments . This is consistent with the levels and timing set out in the BCBS D -\nSIB framework. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.7 to 40.23]\n66. The 1% surcharge will be implemented through an extension of the capital conservation\nbuffer. This is in line with the tre atment of the higher loss absorbency requirement for global\nsystemically important banks (G -SIBs) prescribed by the BCBS .\n30 Table 7 below sets out the\nminimum capital conservation ratios a D -SIB must meet at various CET1 capital ratios  and Tier\n1 leverage ratio s.31 D-SIBs will thus be subject to a pre -determined set of restrictions on the  \n25  The Superintendent will consider factors such as whether an institution\u2019s business model involves providing\ncredit through intermediation of funds or whether  the conditions that give rise to financial system -wide issues are\nexplicitly addressed in a robust manner in the institution\u2019s internal capital targets.\n26   The countercyclical buffer is to be computed and applied at the consolidated FRFI parent level, i. e. OSFI\nregulated deposit -taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit -taking institution are not\nsubject to the countercyclical buffer.\n27   The pre -announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.\n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA\nOperational Risk ].\n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI\u2019s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs.\n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6\n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D -SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements.\nIn the event that a D -SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CE T1, 9.5% Tier\n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.",

Domestic Stability Buffer\n67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI\u2019s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with\nCET1 c apital.\n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI\u2019s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.  \n32   Details related to the OSFI\u2019s DSB are included on OSFI\u2019s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions",

D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process.\nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a\nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS).  \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In\nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between\nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions\u2019 ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB\nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate\ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic\npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in \nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the \nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .   \n\n\n## Page 2\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 2 Chapter 1  - Overview of risk -based capital \nrequirements  \n \nThe Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) for banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies are set out in nine chapters, each of which has been issued as a separate document.

Scope of Application  \n 3. The capital adequacy requirements outlined in this guideline apply on a consolidated \nbasis to the following institutions:  \na. all institutions designated  by OSFI as domestic systemically important banks (D -\nSIBs); and  \nb. small and medium- sized deposit -taking institutions (SMSBs\n4), which fall into \nCategories I, II or III as defined in OSFI\u2019s SMSB Capital and Liquidity Requirements Guideline.\n5  \n 4. The consolidated entity includes all subsidiaries except insurance subsidiaries.\n OSFI \nexpects institutions to hold capital within the consolidated group in a manner that is consistent with the level and location of risk.    \n1. 2. Regulatory Capital  \n 5. Total capital consists of the sum of the following elements: \ni. Tier 1 capital, consisting  of: \na. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ; and  \nb. Additional Tier 1 capital  \nii. Tier 2 capital  \n \n \n2    The Basel Framework   \n3  Following the form at: [Basel Framework, XXX yy.zz]  \n4    SMSBs are banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, \nand federally regulated loan companies that have not been designated by OSFI as domestic systemically \nimpo rtant banks (D -SIBs). This includes subsidiaries of SMSBs or D -SIBs that are banks (including federal \ncredit unions) , federally regulated trust companies or federally regulated loan companies.  \n5    SMSB Capital and Liquidity Guideline  \n\n\n## Page 5\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 5 6. The criteria for the capital elements comprising the two tiers, as well as the various \nlimits, restrictions and regulatory adjustments to which they are subject, are de scribed in \nChapter  2. \n \n1. 3. Total Risk -weighted Assets \n \n7. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) make up the denominator of the risk- based capital ratios, \nand is calculated as the higher of:  \na. the sum of the following three elements:  \ni. RWA for credit risk;  \nii. RWA for market risk; and  \niii. RWA for operational risk; and \nb. the adjusted RWA determined as per the capital floor described in section 1.5. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.4]  \n 1.3.1. Credit Risk   8. RWA for credit risk (including counterparty credit risk) is calculated as the sum of:  \na. Credit  RWA for banking book exposures which, except the RWA listed in (b) \nthrough (e) below, is calculated using:   \ni. the standar dized approach (as set out in Chapter 4); or  \nii. the Internal Ratings -Based (IRB) approach (as set out in Chapter 5).  \nb. RWA for counterparty credit risk from banking book exposures and trading book exposures (as set out in Chapter 7), except the exposures liste d in (c) and (f) below.  \nc.

RWA for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk for exposures in the trading and banking book, calculated as set out in Chapter 8 using either:  \ni. The standardized approach for CVA; or  \nii. The advanced approach for CVA.    \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.6]  \n 9. Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \n 11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:  \n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;   \n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n\u2022 own-use property, plant and equipment  \n 12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:  \n\u2022 the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n\u2022 accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations  \n 13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \n \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \nbooked in Canada.  \n\n\n## Page 7\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 7  \na.

For banks with OSFI  approval to use IMM to calculate counterparty credit risk \nexposures, EAD for counterparty credit risk exposures must be calculated according to sections 7.1.3 through 7.1.5. [Basel Framework, RBC 20.8]  \n \n1.3.2. Market Risk  \n 15. Market risk requirements, as outlined in Chapter 9, apply to internationally active \ninstitutions and all institutions designated by OSFI as D -SIBs. OSFI retains the right to apply the \nframework to other institutions, on a case -by-case basis, if trading activities are a large \nproportion of overall operations. \n \n16. Institutions subject to market risk requirements must identify the instruments that are in \nthe trading book following the requirements of Chapter 9. All instruments that are not in the trading book and all other a ssets of the institution (termed \u201cbanking book exposures\u201d) must be \ntreated under one of the credit risk approaches.

All institutions are subject to operational risk requirements, as described in Chapter 3.  \n 19. RWA for operational risk are calculated using either:  \na. The Simplified Standardized Approach, set out in section 3.3; or  \nb. The Standardized Approach, set out in section 3.4. \n \n20. D-SIBs and SMSBs that report adjusted gross income\n7 greater than $1.5 billion must \nuse the standardized approach. SMSBs with annual adjusted gross income less than $1.5 billion must use the simplified standardized approach, unless they have received approval from OSFI to \nuse the standardized approach, as set out in section 3.2. \n \n7      Adjusted gross income is defined in section 3.3  \n\n\n## Page 8\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 8  \n1. 4. Approval to use Internal Model Based Approaches  \n \n21. Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n 22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\n8 Institutions that do not receive \napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23. An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \n\u2022 The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \n\u2022 On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \n \n \n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions \u2013 Implemen tation Note  \n\n\n## Page 9\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution\u2019s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n \n \n1. 5. Capital Floor \u2013Internal Model Based Approaches  \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions\u2019 capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline. \n \n\n\n## Page 10\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \nFiscal year  \n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \n \n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter 4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this guideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \n \n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. After November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.   34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline.  35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \ncalculation of the capital floor:  \na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \nb. SEC-IRBA;  \nc. the IMA for market risk;  \nd. the VaR  models approach to counterparty credit risk; and  \n \n10  For institutions with a fiscal year ending October 31 or December 31, respectively.  \n\n\n## Page 11",

Adjusted Capital Requirement  \n \n36. The adjusted capital requirement is based on application of all of the chapters of this \nguideline and is equal to the net total of the following amounts: \ni. total risk -weighted assets, plus \nii. 12.5 times the provisioning shortfall deduction, less \niii. 12.5 times excess provisions included in Tier 2, less \niv. 12.5 times the amount of general allowances that may be recognized in Tier 2 in respect of exposures for which the standardized approach is used. \n 37. The provisioning shortfall deduction, excess provisions included in Tier 2, and general \nallowances in Tier 2 in respect of standardized portfolios are defined in section 2.1.3.7 of Chapter 2 of this guideline.  \n1. 6. Calculation of OSFI Minimum Capital Requirements  \n 1.6.1. Risk -Based Capital Ratios for D-SIBs and Category I and II SMSBs  \n 38. Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for \nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for \nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets \nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:  \nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 \n Where:  \nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \n 39. Table 2 provides the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios for institutions \nbefore application of the capital conservation buffer.   \n \n11  There are two exceptions to this rule. One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the \nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so.

Mandated Capital Buffers  \n 42. In addition to the minimum capital ratios, institutions are required to hold a capital \nconservation buffer and, where applicable, a countercyclical buffer.    43. Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions\u2019 resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.20]  \n\n\n## Page 13\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 13 44. When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In \nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions \nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \n \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of RWA .\n13 Table 4 provides the minimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conversation buffer. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.2]   \n \nTable 4: Capital conservation buffer (as % of RWA)  \nCapital conservation buffer  2.5%  \nMinimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer  \nCET1  7.0%  \nTier 1  8.5%  \nTotal  10.5%  \n 48. Capital distribution constraints will be imposed on an institution when capital levels fall \nwithin the buffer conservation range. Institutions will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall within the buffer range as they experience losses. The constraints imposed \n \n12    Applies only to performance bonuses issued to institutions\u2019 senior management. The term \u201csenior management\u201d  \nis defined in OSFI\u2019s Corporate Governance Guideline .  \n13   For Category  III SMSBs, the capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of [Adjusted Total Assets +  \nRWA Operational Risk ] \n\n\n## Page 14\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 14 relate only to distributions, not the operations of the institution. The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings)  \n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \n>7.0%  0% \n 50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio . \n\n\n## Page 15\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer  \n 53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed \nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide \nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential \nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and \nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when \n \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (\u201cFISC\u201d), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.  \n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides informat ion that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national \nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 30.10]  \n17  The Bank of Canada will be the primary source of public information on macro- financial developments and the \nstate of vulnerabilities in Canada with regard to the countercyclical buffer, including as published in its Financial \nSystem Review (FSR).  \n18   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer requirement would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total \nAssets + RWA Operational Risk ] \n\n\n## Page 16\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 16 circumstances warrant. This requirement will be released when OSFI, in consultation \nwith its SAC partners, assesses that system -wide risks have dissipated or crystallized. \n(b) Institutions with private sector credit exposures outside Canada will look at the geographic location of those exposures  and calculate their consolidated countercyclical \nbuffer requirement as a weighted average of the countercyclical buffers that are being applied in jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures. \n(c) The countercycl ical buffer to which the institution is subject will be implemented by way \nof an extension of the capital conservation buffer described in section 1.7.1. Institutions will be subject to restrictions on distributions of earnings if they breach the extended buffer.  \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.8] \n 55.

The weighting applied to the buffer in place in each jurisdiction will be the institution\u2019s \ncredit risk RWA that relates to private sector credit exposures in that jurisdiction divided by the institution\u2019s credit risk RWA that relates to private sector credit exposures across all jurisdictions .\n22 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.14]  \n \n60. Institutions will be subject to a consolidated countercyclical buffer that varies between \n0%, where no jurisdiction in which the institution has private sector credit exposures has \nactivated a buffer, and 2.5% of total RWA .23 The consolidated countercyclical  buffer applies to \nconsolidated total RWA (including credit, market, and operational risk)  as used in the \ncalculation of all risk -based capital ratios, consistent with it being an extension of the capital \nconservation buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.12 F AQ1]  \n 61. Private sector credit exposures in this context refers to exposures to private sector \ncounterparties, including non- bank financial sector counterparties, which attract a credit risk \ncapital charge in the banking book and the risk- weighted equivalent trading book capital charges \nfor specific risk, the incremental risk charge, and securitization. Interbank exposures and exposures to the public sector are excluded. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.13 FAQ1]  \n 62. When considering the jurisdiction to which a private se ctor credit exposure relates, \ninstitutions should use an ultimate risk basis.

The location is identified according to the concept of ultimate risk (i.e. based on the \ncountry where the final risk lies, not where the exposure has been booked). The geographic loc ation identifies the \njurisdiction whose announced countercyclical buffer add -on is to be applied by the institution to the \ncorresponding credit exposure, appropriately weighted. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 30.13 FAQ2 and 30.14 FAQ1]  \n22   For Category I II SMSBs, the weighting will be based on the institution\u2019s private sector credit exposures in a \nparticular jurisdiction divided by its total private sector credit exposures across all jurisdictions.  \n23   For Category III SMSBs, the consolidated countercycli cal buffer requirement would be applied as a % of \n[Adjusted Total Assets + RWA Operational Risk ]. \n24  For purposes of determining the country of residence of the ultimate obligor, guarantees and credit derivatives are considered but not collateral with the exception of exposures where the lender looks primarily to the revenues \ngenerated by the collateral, both as the source of repayment and as security for the exposure, such as Project \nFinance . The location of a securitization exposure is the location of the underlying obligor or, where the \nexposures are located in more than one jurisdiction, the institution can allocate the exposure to the country with \nthe largest aggregate unpaid principal balance.  \n\n\n## Page 18",

To give \ninstitutions time to adjust to a buffer level, OSFI will pre -announce its decision, to activate or \nraise the level of the countercyclical buffer, by up to 12 months but no less than 6 months. Conversely, decisions to release the countercyclical buffer will normally take effect immediately. Institutions with foreign exposures are expected to match host jurisdictions\u2019 implementation \ntimelines unless the announcement per iod is shorter than 6 months in which case compliance will \nonly be required 6 months after the host\u2019s announcement .\n27 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.11]  \n \n64. The maximum countercyclical buffer relating to foreign private sector credit exposures \nwill be 2.5% of total  RWAs .28 Jurisdictions may choose to implement a buffer in excess of 2.5%, \nif deemed appropriate in their national context; in such cases the international reciprocity \nprovisions will not apply to the additional amounts. In addition, institutions are not e xpected to \nreplicate sectoral buffers or similar measures adopted by foreign jurisdictions that depart from \nthe internationally agreed countercyclical buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must \nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements. In addition, when disclosing their buffers, if any, institutions must also disclose the geographic breakdown of their private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.19]  \n \n1. 8. Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) Surcharge  \n 65. OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of \nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1% \nof RWAs. The 1% capital surcharge will be periodically reviewed in light of national and international developments . This is consistent with the levels and timing set out in the BCBS D -\nSIB framework. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.7 to 40.23]  \n 66. The 1% surcharge will be implemented through an extension of the capital conservation \nbuffer. This is in line with the tre atment of the higher loss absorbency requirement for global \nsystemically important banks (G -SIBs) prescribed by the BCBS .\n30 Table 7 below sets out the \nminimum capital conservation ratios a D -SIB must meet at various CET1 capital ratios  and Tier \n1 leverage ratio s.31 D-SIBs will thus be subject to a pre -determined set of restrictions on the \n \n25  The Superintendent will consider factors such as whether an institution\u2019s business model involves providing \ncredit through intermediation of funds or whether  the conditions that give rise to financial system -wide issues are \nexplicitly addressed in a robust manner in the institution\u2019s internal capital targets.  \n26   The countercyclical buffer is to be computed and applied at the consolidated FRFI parent level, i. e. OSFI \nregulated deposit -taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit -taking institution are not \nsubject to the countercyclical buffer.  \n27   The pre -announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.  \n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA \nOperational Risk ]. \n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI\u2019s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs.  \n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6  \n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D -SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements.  \nIn the event that a D -SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CE T1, 9.5% Tier \n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.  \n\n\n## Page 19\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 19 ability to make distributions, such as dividends and share buy-backs, if they do not meet these \nrequirements (see relevant provisions of section 1.7.1).  \n \n \nTable 7: Minimum capital conservation ratios for D -SIBs at various ranges of \nCET1  or Tier 1 Leverage Ratios  \nCET1 Ratio  Tier 1 Leverage \nRatio  Minimum Capital Conservation \nRatio  \n4.5% - 5.375%  3%\u20133.125%  100%  \n>5.375% - 6.250%  > 3.125% \u20133.25%  80% \n>6.250% - 7.125%  > 3.25% \u20133.375%  60% \n>7.125% - 8.0%  > 3.375% \u20133.50%  40% \n>8.0%  > 3.50%  0% \n  \n1. 9. Domestic Stability Buffer  \n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI\u2019s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \nCommittee (FISC) .\n33 \n \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated \nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \nCET1 c apital.  \n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI\u2019s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \n \n \n32   Details related to the OSFI\u2019s DSB are included on OSFI\u2019s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n\n\n## Page 20\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \n \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could \nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to \nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions\u2019 ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019 \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n \n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n  \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.  \n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \nsurcharge of 1.0%.   \n\n\n## Page 21\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 21 Table 8: Target Capital Ratios  \n \n SMSBs  D-SIBs  \nTarget CET1 capital  7.0%  8.0% plus DSB  \nTarget Tier 1 capital  8.5%  9.5% plus DSB  \nTarget Total capital  10.5%  11.5%  plus DSB  \n \n75. These targets are applicable to all institutions and are triggers for supervisory intervention \nconsistent with OSFI\u2019s Guide to Intervention.37 If an institution is offside the relevant target ratios, \nsupervisory action will be taken proportional to the shortfall and circumstances that caused the shortfall and may include a range of actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on distribu tions.  \n 76. The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions or \ngroups of institutions where circumstances warrant, including in respect of idiosyncratic and/or systemic risks that are not adequately captured by institutions \u2019 Pillar I capital requirements and \nbuffers. The need for Pillar II capital and corresponding higher target capital ratios would consider how robust existing capital ratios are in light of an institution\u2019s allowances, stress testing program, and ICAAP results .\n38  \n \n \n37  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n38  For OSFI\u2019s expectations refer to Guideline E -18: Stress Testing  and Guideline E -19: Internal Capital Adequac y \nAssessment Process (ICAAP) . \n\n\n## Page 22\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 22 Annex 1   Domestic Systemic Importance and Capital Targets  \n \n1. The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability  \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)  \n\n\n## Page 23\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution\u2019s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada\u2019s Large \nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\n  \n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks  \n\n\n## Page 24\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 24 institution. The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n Supervisory Implications  \n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)  \n\n\n## Page 25\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI\u2019s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \n\u2022 extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs\u2019 major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \n\u2022 greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions\u2019 risk \nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \n\u2022 more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \n\u2022 stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \n\u2018advanced\u2019 approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \n\u2022 greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \ndisclosure practices;  \n\u2022 selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n\u2022 regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \n\u2022 setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI\u2019s TLAC Guideline ; and  \n\u2022 assessing D -SIBs\u2019 recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\n45  \n Information Disclosure Practices  \n 11.

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in \nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the \nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .   \n\n\n## Page 2\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 2 Chapter 1  - Overview of risk -based capital \nrequirements  \n \nThe Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) for banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies are set out in nine chapters, each of which has been issued as a separate document.

Outlined below is an overview of the capital adequacy requirements for banks \n(including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies , collectively referred to as \u2018institutions\u2019.  \n 2. This chapter is drawn from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Basel \nFramework published on the Bank for I nternational S ettlements (BIS)  website .\n2 For reference, \nthe Basel paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are indicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph .\n3  \n \n1. 1. Scope of Application  \n 3. The capital adequacy requirements outlined in this guideline apply on a consolidated \nbasis to the following institutions:  \na. all institutions designated  by OSFI as domestic systemically important banks (D -\nSIBs); and  \nb. small and medium- sized deposit -taking institutions (SMSBs\n4), which fall into \nCategories I, II or III as defined in OSFI\u2019s SMSB Capital and Liquidity Requirements Guideline.\n5  \n 4. The consolidated entity includes all subsidiaries except insurance subsidiaries.\n OSFI \nexpects institutions to hold capital within the consolidated group in a manner that is consistent with the level and location of risk.    \n1. 2. Regulatory Capital  \n 5. Total capital consists of the sum of the following elements: \ni. Tier 1 capital, consisting  of: \na. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ; and  \nb. Additional Tier 1 capital  \nii. Tier 2 capital  \n \n \n2    The Basel Framework   \n3  Following the form at: [Basel Framework, XXX yy.zz]  \n4    SMSBs are banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, \nand federally regulated loan companies that have not been designated by OSFI as domestic systemically \nimpo rtant banks (D -SIBs). This includes subsidiaries of SMSBs or D -SIBs that are banks (including federal \ncredit unions) , federally regulated trust companies or federally regulated loan companies.  \n5    SMSB Capital and Liquidity Guideline  \n\n\n## Page 5\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 5 6. The criteria for the capital elements comprising the two tiers, as well as the various \nlimits, restrictions and regulatory adjustments to which they are subject, are de scribed in \nChapter  2. \n \n1. 3. Total Risk -weighted Assets \n \n7. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) make up the denominator of the risk- based capital ratios, \nand is calculated as the higher of:  \na. the sum of the following three elements:  \ni. RWA for credit risk;  \nii. RWA for market risk; and  \niii. RWA for operational risk; and \nb. the adjusted RWA determined as per the capital floor described in section 1.5. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.4]  \n 1.3.1. Credit Risk   8. RWA for credit risk (including counterparty credit risk) is calculated as the sum of:  \na. Credit  RWA for banking book exposures which, except the RWA listed in (b) \nthrough (e) below, is calculated using:   \ni. the standar dized approach (as set out in Chapter 4); or  \nii. the Internal Ratings -Based (IRB) approach (as set out in Chapter 5).  \nb. RWA for counterparty credit risk from banking book exposures and trading book exposures (as set out in Chapter 7), except the exposures liste d in (c) and (f) below.  \nc. Credit RWA for equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book calculated using one or more of the approaches set out in Chapter 4:  \ni. The look- through approach \nii. The mandate -based approach  \niii. The fall -back approach  \nd. RWA for se curitization exposures held in the banking book, calculating using one \nor more of the approaches set out in Chapter 6:  \ni. Securitization Standardized Approach (SEC -SA) \nii. Securitization External  Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -ERBA)  \niii. Securitization Internal Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -IRBA)  \niv. Securitization Internal Assessment Approach (SEC -IAA)  \nv.

RWA for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk for exposures in the trading and banking book, calculated as set out in Chapter 8 using either:  \ni. The standardized approach for CVA; or  \nii. The advanced approach for CVA.    \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.6]  \n 9. Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \n 11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:  \n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;   \n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n\u2022 own-use property, plant and equipment  \n 12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:  \n\u2022 the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n\u2022 accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations  \n 13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \n \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \nbooked in Canada.  \n\n\n## Page 7\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 7  \na. The standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (SA -\nCCR), set out in section 7.1.7. \nb. The comp rehensive approach, set out in section 4.3.3(iii) of Chapter 4.  \nc. The value at risk (VaR) models approach, set out in section 5.4.1(iii) of Chapter 5.  \nd. The Internal Model Method (IMM), set out in section 7.1.5. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.7]  \n \n14. For banks with OSFI  approval to use IMM to calculate counterparty credit risk \nexposures, EAD for counterparty credit risk exposures must be calculated according to sections 7.1.3 through 7.1.5. [Basel Framework, RBC 20.8]  \n \n1.3.2. Market Risk  \n 15. Market risk requirements, as outlined in Chapter 9, apply to internationally active \ninstitutions and all institutions designated by OSFI as D -SIBs. OSFI retains the right to apply the \nframework to other institutions, on a case -by-case basis, if trading activities are a large \nproportion of overall operations. \n \n16. Institutions subject to market risk requirements must identify the instruments that are in \nthe trading book following the requirements of Chapter 9. All instruments that are not in the trading book and all other a ssets of the institution (termed \u201cbanking book exposures\u201d) must be \ntreated under one of the credit risk approaches. [Basel Framework, RBC 20.5]  \n 17. RWA for market risk are calculated as  RWA for market risk for instruments in the \ntrading book and for foreign e xchange risk and commodities risk for exposures in the banking \nbook, calculated using:  \ni. The standardized approach, as described in section 9.5; or  \nii. The internal models approach set out in section 9.6. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.9]  \n 1.3.3. Operational Risk  \n 18. All institutions are subject to operational risk requirements, as described in Chapter 3.  \n 19. RWA for operational risk are calculated using either:  \na. The Simplified Standardized Approach, set out in section 3.3; or  \nb. The Standardized Approach, set out in section 3.4. \n \n20. D-SIBs and SMSBs that report adjusted gross income\n7 greater than $1.5 billion must \nuse the standardized approach. SMSBs with annual adjusted gross income less than $1.5 billion must use the simplified standardized approach, unless they have received approval from OSFI to \nuse the standardized approach, as set out in section 3.2. \n \n7      Adjusted gross income is defined in section 3.3  \n\n\n## Page 8\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 8  \n1. 4. Approval to use Internal Model Based Approaches  \n \n21. Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n 22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\n8 Institutions that do not receive \napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23. An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \n\u2022 The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \n\u2022 On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \n \n \n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions \u2013 Implemen tation Note  \n\n\n## Page 9\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution\u2019s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n \n \n1. 5. Capital Floor \u2013Internal Model Based Approaches  \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions\u2019 capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline. \n \n\n\n## Page 10\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \nFiscal year  \n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \n \n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter 4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this guideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \n \n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. After November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.   34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline.  35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \ncalculation of the capital floor:  \na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \nb. SEC-IRBA;  \nc. the IMA for market risk;  \nd. the VaR  models approach to counterparty credit risk; and  \n \n10  For institutions with a fiscal year ending October 31 or December 31, respectively.  \n\n\n## Page 11",

The adjusted capital requirement is based on application of all of the chapters of this \nguideline and is equal to the net total of the following amounts: \ni. total risk -weighted assets, plus \nii. 12.5 times the provisioning shortfall deduction, less \niii. 12.5 times excess provisions included in Tier 2, less \niv. 12.5 times the amount of general allowances that may be recognized in Tier 2 in respect of exposures for which the standardized approach is used. \n 37.

Calculation of OSFI Minimum Capital Requirements  \n 1.6.1. Risk -Based Capital Ratios for D-SIBs and Category I and II SMSBs  \n 38. Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for \nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for \nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets \nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:  \nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 \n Where:  \nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \n 39.

One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor.

Mandated Capital Buffers  \n 42. In addition to the minimum capital ratios, institutions are required to hold a capital \nconservation buffer and, where applicable, a countercyclical buffer.    43. Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions\u2019 resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.20]  \n\n\n## Page 13\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 13 44. When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In \nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions \nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \n \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of RWA .\n13 Table 4 provides the minimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conversation buffer. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.2]   \n \nTable 4: Capital conservation buffer (as % of RWA)  \nCapital conservation buffer  2.5%  \nMinimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer  \nCET1  7.0%  \nTier 1  8.5%  \nTotal  10.5%  \n 48. Capital distribution constraints will be imposed on an institution when capital levels fall \nwithin the buffer conservation range. Institutions will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall within the buffer range as they experience losses. The constraints imposed \n \n12    Applies only to performance bonuses issued to institutions\u2019 senior management. The term \u201csenior management\u201d  \nis defined in OSFI\u2019s Corporate Governance Guideline .  \n13   For Category  III SMSBs, the capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of [Adjusted Total Assets +  \nRWA Operational Risk ] \n\n\n## Page 14\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 14 relate only to distributions, not the operations of the institution. The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings)  \n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \n>7.0%  0% \n 50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio . \n\n\n## Page 15\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer  \n 53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed \nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide \nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential \nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and \nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when \n \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (\u201cFISC\u201d), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.  \n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides informat ion that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national \nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 30.10]  \n17  The Bank of Canada will be the primary source of public information on macro- financial developments and the \nstate of vulnerabilities in Canada with regard to the countercyclical buffer, including as published in its Financial \nSystem Review (FSR).  \n18   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer requirement would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total \nAssets + RWA Operational Risk ] \n\n\n## Page 16\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 16 circumstances warrant. This requirement will be released when OSFI, in consultation \nwith its SAC partners, assesses that system -wide risks have dissipated or crystallized. \n(b) Institutions with private sector credit exposures outside Canada will look at the geographic location of those exposures  and calculate their consolidated countercyclical \nbuffer requirement as a weighted average of the countercyclical buffers that are being applied in jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures. \n(c) The countercycl ical buffer to which the institution is subject will be implemented by way \nof an extension of the capital conservation buffer described in section 1.7.1. Institutions will be subject to restrictions on distributions of earnings if they breach the extended buffer.  \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.8] \n 55. Institutions must meet the countercyclical buffer with CET1. Consistent with the capital \nconservation buffer, the CET1 ratio in this context includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% minimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additional CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and 8% Total Capital requirements as well as D -SIBs\u2019 minimum 21.5% TLAC requirement. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.17]  56. Table 6 provides the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of the CET1 capital ratio .\n19 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.17] \n \nTable 6: Individual institution minimum capital conservation standards  \nCET1  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios \n(expressed as a percentage of earnings)  \nWithin first quartile of buffer  100%  \nWithin second quartile of buffer  80% \nWithin third quartile of buffer  60% \nWithin fourth quartile of buffer  40% \nAbove top of buffer  0% \n 57. The consolidated countercyclical buffer will be a weighted average of the buffers \ndeployed in Canada and across BCBS member jurisdictions and se lected non -member \njurisdictions\n20 to which the institution has private sector credit exposures. [Basel Framework, \nRBC 30.14] \n \n58. Institutions will look at the geographic location of their private sector credit exposures \nand calculate their consolidated countercyclical buffer as a weighted average of the buffers that are being applied in each jurisdiction to which they have such exposures. The buffer that will \n \n19  Similar constraints apply with respect to breaches of Tier 1 capital and Total capital requirements. Institution s \nshould apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio where they breach more than one requirement.  \n20  Institutions are expected to reciprocate the buffers implemented by every jurisdiction listed on the dedicated page \nof the BIS website : Countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) . Reciprocity is mandatory, for all Basel Committee \nmember jurisdictions, up to a maximum of 2.5% RWA, irrespective of whether host authori ties require a higher \nadd-on. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 30.13 FAQ3 and FAQ4]  \n\n\n## Page 17\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 17 apply to an institution will thus reflect the geographic composition of its portfolio of private \nsector credit exposures .21 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.13]  \n 59. The weighting applied to the buffer in place in each jurisdiction will be the institution\u2019s \ncredit risk RWA that relates to private sector credit exposures in that jurisdiction divided by the institution\u2019s credit risk RWA that relates to private sector credit exposures across all jurisdictions .\n22 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.14]  \n \n60. Institutions will be subject to a consolidated countercyclical buffer that varies between \n0%, where no jurisdiction in which the institution has private sector credit exposures has \nactivated a buffer, and 2.5% of total RWA .23 The consolidated countercyclical  buffer applies to \nconsolidated total RWA (including credit, market, and operational risk)  as used in the \ncalculation of all risk -based capital ratios, consistent with it being an extension of the capital \nconservation buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.12 F AQ1]  \n 61. Private sector credit exposures in this context refers to exposures to private sector \ncounterparties, including non- bank financial sector counterparties, which attract a credit risk \ncapital charge in the banking book and the risk- weighted equivalent trading book capital charges \nfor specific risk, the incremental risk charge, and securitization. Interbank exposures and exposures to the public sector are excluded. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.13 FAQ1]  \n 62. When considering the jurisdiction to which a private se ctor credit exposure relates, \ninstitutions should use an ultimate risk basis. Ultimate risk refers to the jurisdiction where the final risk lies\n24 as opposed to the jurisdiction of the immediate counterparties or where the \nexposure is booked. [Basel Framew ork, RBC 30.14]  \n 63. The decision to activate, increase, decrease or release the countercyclical buffer will be \nformally communicated.  The Superintendent may exempt groups of institutions, other than D -\nSIBs and foreign bank subsidiaries in Canada, from the countercyclical buffer requirements if the \n \n21   The geographic location of an institution\u2019s private sector exposures is determined by the location of the \ncounterparties that make up the capital charge irrespective of  the institution\u2019s own physical location or its \ncountry of incorporation. The location is identified according to the concept of ultimate risk (i.e. based on the \ncountry where the final risk lies, not where the exposure has been booked). The geographic loc ation identifies the \njurisdiction whose announced countercyclical buffer add -on is to be applied by the institution to the \ncorresponding credit exposure, appropriately weighted. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 30.13 FAQ2 and 30.14 FAQ1]  \n22   For Category I II SMSBs, the weighting will be based on the institution\u2019s private sector credit exposures in a \nparticular jurisdiction divided by its total private sector credit exposures across all jurisdictions.  \n23   For Category III SMSBs, the consolidated countercycli cal buffer requirement would be applied as a % of \n[Adjusted Total Assets + RWA Operational Risk ]. \n24  For purposes of determining the country of residence of the ultimate obligor, guarantees and credit derivatives are considered but not collateral with the exception of exposures where the lender looks primarily to the revenues \ngenerated by the collateral, both as the source of repayment and as security for the exposure, such as Project \nFinance . The location of a securitization exposure is the location of the underlying obligor or, where the \nexposures are located in more than one jurisdiction, the institution can allocate the exposure to the country with \nthe largest aggregate unpaid principal balance.  \n\n\n## Page 18",

To give \ninstitutions time to adjust to a buffer level, OSFI will pre -announce its decision, to activate or \nraise the level of the countercyclical buffer, by up to 12 months but no less than 6 months. Conversely, decisions to release the countercyclical buffer will normally take effect immediately. Institutions with foreign exposures are expected to match host jurisdictions\u2019 implementation \ntimelines unless the announcement per iod is shorter than 6 months in which case compliance will \nonly be required 6 months after the host\u2019s announcement .\n27 [Basel Framework, RBC 30.11]  \n \n64. The maximum countercyclical buffer relating to foreign private sector credit exposures \nwill be 2.5% of total  RWAs .28 Jurisdictions may choose to implement a buffer in excess of 2.5%, \nif deemed appropriate in their national context; in such cases the international reciprocity \nprovisions will not apply to the additional amounts. In addition, institutions are not e xpected to \nreplicate sectoral buffers or similar measures adopted by foreign jurisdictions that depart from \nthe internationally agreed countercyclical buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must \nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements. In addition, when disclosing their buffers, if any, institutions must also disclose the geographic breakdown of their private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.19]  \n \n1. 8. Domestic Systemically Important Bank (D-SIB) Surcharge  \n 65. OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of \nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1% \nof RWAs. The 1% capital surcharge will be periodically reviewed in light of national and international developments . This is consistent with the levels and timing set out in the BCBS D -\nSIB framework. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.7 to 40.23]  \n 66. The 1% surcharge will be implemented through an extension of the capital conservation \nbuffer. This is in line with the tre atment of the higher loss absorbency requirement for global \nsystemically important banks (G -SIBs) prescribed by the BCBS .\n30 Table 7 below sets out the \nminimum capital conservation ratios a D -SIB must meet at various CET1 capital ratios  and Tier \n1 leverage ratio s.31 D-SIBs will thus be subject to a pre -determined set of restrictions on the \n \n25  The Superintendent will consider factors such as whether an institution\u2019s business model involves providing \ncredit through intermediation of funds or whether  the conditions that give rise to financial system -wide issues are \nexplicitly addressed in a robust manner in the institution\u2019s internal capital targets.  \n26   The countercyclical buffer is to be computed and applied at the consolidated FRFI parent level, i. e. OSFI \nregulated deposit -taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit -taking institution are not \nsubject to the countercyclical buffer.  \n27   The pre -announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.  \n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA \nOperational Risk ]. \n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI\u2019s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs.  \n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6  \n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D -SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements.  \nIn the event that a D -SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CE T1, 9.5% Tier \n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.  \n\n\n## Page 19\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 19 ability to make distributions, such as dividends and share buy-backs, if they do not meet these \nrequirements (see relevant provisions of section 1.7.1).  \n \n \nTable 7: Minimum capital conservation ratios for D -SIBs at various ranges of \nCET1  or Tier 1 Leverage Ratios  \nCET1 Ratio  Tier 1 Leverage \nRatio  Minimum Capital Conservation \nRatio  \n4.5% - 5.375%  3%\u20133.125%  100%  \n>5.375% - 6.250%  > 3.125% \u20133.25%  80% \n>6.250% - 7.125%  > 3.25% \u20133.375%  60% \n>7.125% - 8.0%  > 3.375% \u20133.50%  40% \n>8.0%  > 3.50%  0% \n  \n1. 9. Domestic Stability Buffer  \n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI\u2019s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \nCommittee (FISC) .\n33 \n \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated \nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \nCET1 c apital.  \n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI\u2019s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \n \n \n32   Details related to the OSFI\u2019s DSB are included on OSFI\u2019s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n\n\n## Page 20\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \n \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could \nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to \nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions\u2019 ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019 \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n \n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n  \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.  \n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \nsurcharge of 1.0%.   \n\n\n## Page 21\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 21 Table 8: Target Capital Ratios  \n \n SMSBs  D-SIBs  \nTarget CET1 capital  7.0%  8.0% plus DSB  \nTarget Tier 1 capital  8.5%  9.5% plus DSB  \nTarget Total capital  10.5%  11.5%  plus DSB  \n \n75. These targets are applicable to all institutions and are triggers for supervisory intervention \nconsistent with OSFI\u2019s Guide to Intervention.37 If an institution is offside the relevant target ratios, \nsupervisory action will be taken proportional to the shortfall and circumstances that caused the shortfall and may include a range of actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on distribu tions.  \n 76. The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions or \ngroups of institutions where circumstances warrant, including in respect of idiosyncratic and/or systemic risks that are not adequately captured by institutions \u2019 Pillar I capital requirements and \nbuffers. The need for Pillar II capital and corresponding higher target capital ratios would consider how robust existing capital ratios are in light of an institution\u2019s allowances, stress testing program, and ICAAP results .\n38  \n \n \n37  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n38  For OSFI\u2019s expectations refer to Guideline E -18: Stress Testing  and Guideline E -19: Internal Capital Adequac y \nAssessment Process (ICAAP) . \n\n\n## Page 22\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 22 Annex 1   Domestic Systemic Importance and Capital Targets  \n \n1. The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability  \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)  \n\n\n## Page 23\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution\u2019s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada\u2019s Large \nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\n  \n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks  \n\n\n## Page 24\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 24 institution. The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n Supervisory Implications  \n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)  \n\n\n## Page 25\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI\u2019s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \n\u2022 extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs\u2019 major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \n\u2022 greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions\u2019 risk \nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \n\u2022 more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \n\u2022 stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \n\u2018advanced\u2019 approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \n\u2022 greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \ndisclosure practices;  \n\u2022 selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n\u2022 regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \n\u2022 setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI\u2019s TLAC Guideline ; and  \n\u2022 assessing D -SIBs\u2019 recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\n45  \n Information Disclosure Practices  \n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions\u2019 risk models and risk management \npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \n \n \n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board\u2019s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \nImportant Financial Institutions . OSFI is responsible for leading the assessment of recovery plans. The Canada \nDeposit Insurance Corporation is responsible for leading the assessment of resolution plans.  \n46   OSFI's Pillar 3 Disclosure Guideline for D -SIBs : this guideline provides expectations for the domestic \nimplementation of all three phases of the Pillar 3 Framework.  \n47  Enhancing the Risk Disclosures of Banks  (FSB : October 2012).  \n\n\n## Page 26",

It encompasses activities such as budgeting, saving, investing, borrowing, and\nforecasting to ensure the e\ufb03cient allocation of resources. Finance is broadly categorized\ninto three areas: personal \ufb01nance (managing individual or household \ufb01nances), corporate\n\ufb01nance (managing business \ufb01nances), and public \ufb01nance (managing government revenues\nand expenditures). The primary goal of \ufb01nance is to maximize value while balancing liq-\nuidity and pro\ufb01tability.\nWhat is Risk?\nRisk refers to the uncertainty or potential for loss in \ufb01nancial decisions or investments.\nIt arises from factors such as market volatility, economic changes, or unforeseen events.\nIn \ufb01nance, risk is often measured by the likelihood and magnitude of deviations from\nexpected outcomes. Common types of \ufb01nancial risk include market risk (price \ufb02uctua-\ntions), credit risk (default on loans), liquidity risk (inability to convert assets to cash),\nand operational risk (failures in processes or systems).\nThe Relationship Between Finance and Risk\nFinance and risk are inherently linked, as \ufb01nancial decisions involve weighing potential\nreturns against uncertainties. E\ufb00ective \ufb01nancial management requires assessing and mit-\nigating risks through strategies like diversi\ufb01cation, hedging, or insurance. Understanding\nrisk enables individuals and organizations to make informed decisions, optimize returns,\nand safeguard their \ufb01nancial stability.\nFor more information, explore resources at Investopedia or consult a \ufb01nancial advisor.\n1",
