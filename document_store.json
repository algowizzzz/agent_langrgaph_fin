I\u2019ll explain what `refine` does, whether it\u2019s suitable for this task, and how it compares to the proposed LLM-based chunk processing approach, considering the document\u2019s size and your LlamaIndex setup.  \n---",

      "page_content": "### **What Does the `refine` Response Mode Do?**\nThe `refine` response mode in LlamaIndex is a method for generating or improving responses by processing document chunks sequentially and iteratively. It\u2019s typically used in query engines (like the Summary Query Engine or a custom one) to refine an initial answer by incorporating information from each chunk, one at a time. Here\u2019s the logical breakdown:  \n1. **Initial Answer**:\n- The LLM starts with an initial response to the query, either based on the first chunk or a blank/seed answer.\n- For example, for \u201cCount the number of times MetaGPT is mentioned,\u201d the initial answer might be \u201c0\u201d (no mentions yet).  \n2. **Iterative Refinement**:\n- The LLM processes each chunk of the document (e.g., created by `SentenceSplitter` with `chunk_size=1024` in your code) one by one.\n- For each chunk, the LLM is given:\n- The current answer (e.g., the running count).\n- The new chunk\u2019s text.\n- A prompt to refine the answer (e.g., \u201cUpdate the count of \u2018MetaGPT\u2019 mentions based on this new text\u201d).\n- The LLM updates the answer by incorporating the new chunk\u2019s information. For counting, it would count \u201cMetaGPT\u201d in the chunk and add that to the running total.  \n3. **Sequential Processing**:\n- Chunks are processed in order, with the LLM refining the answer after each chunk until all chunks are exhausted.\n- For a 1-million-token document split into ~977 chunks (1,000,000 \u00f7 1024), the LLM would make ~977 calls, each refining the count.  \n4. **Final Output**:\n- After processing all chunks, the LLM returns the final refined answer (e.g., \u201cMetaGPT is mentioned 42 times\u201d).  \n5. **Async Support**:\n- Like `tree_summarize`, `refine` can use asynchronous processing (`use_async=True` in your code) to speed up LLM calls, though it\u2019s still sequential in logic (each refinement depends on the previous answer).  \n---",

      "page_content": "### **Can `refine` Count \u201cMetaGPT\u201d Mentions Effectively?**\nLet\u2019s evaluate whether `refine` is suitable for your task, given the constraints:\n- **1-million-token document** (~977 chunks at 1024 tokens each).\n- **LLM-based approach** (using `OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")` from your code).\n- **No Vector Query Engine** (to avoid RAG issues like missing chunks or picking similar terms).\n- **Precise counting** of \u201cMetaGPT\u201d mentions.  \n#### **Pros of Using `refine`**\n1. **Sequential Counting**:\n- `refine` naturally processes chunks one by one, maintaining a running count. This aligns well with counting tasks, as the LLM can update the total after each chunk.\n- Example: If chunk 1 has 3 mentions, the answer is \u201c3.\u201d If chunk 2 has 5, the LLM refines it to \u201c8,\u201d and so on.  \n2. **Fits LlamaIndex Setup**:\n- You can use `refine` within your existing code by configuring a query engine (e.g., replacing `response_mode=\"tree_summarize\"` with `response_mode=\"refine\"` in the Summary Query Engine or creating a custom query engine).\n- It leverages `SentenceSplitter`, `OpenAI` LLM, and async support (`nest_asyncio.apply()`).  \n3. **LLM-Based**:\n- `refine` uses the LLM for all processing, meeting your requirement to avoid vector-based retrieval. The LLM counts \u201cMetaGPT\u201d in each chunk, ensuring no reliance on embeddings.  \n4. **Customizable Prompt**:\n- You can design a precise prompt for refinement, such as: \u201cGiven the current count of \u2018MetaGPT\u2019 mentions and a new text chunk, count exact matches of \u2018MetaGPT\u2019 in the chunk and update the total. Return only the number.\u201d\n- This ensures the LLM focuses on exact matches, avoiding errors with similar terms.  \n5. **Router Engine Integration**:\n- You can wrap a `refine`-based query engine in a `QueryEngineTool` (like `summary_tool` in your code) with a description like \u201cCounts specific terms in the MetaGPT document.\u201d\n- The `RouterQueryEngine` can route \u201cCount MetaGPT mentions\u201d to this tool.  \n#### **Cons and Challenges**\n1. **Scalability with 1 Million Tokens**:\n- **Challenge**: Processing ~977 chunks requires ~977 LLM calls, as `refine` processes chunks sequentially. This could be slow, costly, and hit OpenAI\u2019s rate limits.\n- **Mitigation**: Use async processing (`use_async=True`) to parallelize where possible, though refinement still depends on the previous answer. Optimize by increasing `chunk_size` (if the LLM\u2019s context window allows) to reduce the number of chunks (e.g., 2048 tokens \u2248 488 chunks).  \n2. **LLM Accuracy**:\n- **Challenge**: The LLM might make errors in counting (e.g., missing a mention or misinterpreting \u201cMeta-GPT\u201d as \u201cMetaGPT\u201d). Errors could accumulate over 977 chunks.\n- **Mitigation**: Use a precise prompt (e.g., \u201cCount exact, case-sensitive \u2018MetaGPT\u2019 as a whole word\u201d). Validate results on a sample of chunks or cross-check with a non-LLM method (if feasible).  \n3. **Context Window Limits**:\n- **Challenge**: Each refinement step sends the current answer, the new chunk, and the prompt to the LLM. For `chunk_size=1024`, this is well within GPT-3.5-turbo\u2019s 16K token limit, but large prompts or metadata could push boundaries.\n- **Mitigation**: Keep the prompt concise and test with smaller chunks (e.g., 512 tokens) if issues arise.  \n4. **Cumulative Errors**:\n- **Challenge**: Since `refine` builds on previous answers, an error in one chunk (e.g., counting 4 mentions instead of 5) propagates to all subsequent refinements.\n- **Mitigation**: Use a robust prompt and consider periodic validation (e.g., logging counts for manual review).  \n5. **Not Optimized for Counting**:\n- **Challenge**: `refine` is designed for iterative answer improvement (e.g., refining a summary or explanation), not specifically for numerical aggregation like counting. It might be less efficient than a custom LLM-based chunk processing approach tailored for counting.\n- **Mitigation**: Structure the prompt to treat refinement as simple addition (e.g., \u201cAdd the count from this chunk to the previous total\u201d).  \n---",

      "page_content": "### **Comparison to Proposed LLM-Based Chunk Processing**\nIn the previous response, I suggested processing chunks sequentially with the LLM, counting \u201cMetaGPT\u201d in each chunk, and summing the counts. How does `refine` compare?  \n#### **Similarities**\n- **Sequential Chunk Processing**: Both methods process all ~977 chunks one by one, using the LLM to count \u201cMetaGPT\u201d in each.\n- **LLM-Based**: Both rely on the LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo) without vector retrieval.\n- **LlamaIndex Integration**: Both can use `SentenceSplitter`, async support, and fit into a `QueryEngineTool` for the Router Engine.\n- **Output**: Both produce a total count (e.g., \u201cMetaGPT is mentioned 42 times\u201d).  \n#### **Differences**\n1. **Processing Logic**:\n- **Refine**: Maintains a running answer, refining it with each chunk. The LLM is prompted to update the current count based on the new chunk.\n- Example prompt: \u201cGiven the current count [X], count \u2018MetaGPT\u2019 in this chunk and update the total.\u201d\n- **Chunk Processing**: Treats each chunk independently, collecting counts separately, then sums them outside the LLM.\n- Example prompt: \u201cCount \u2018MetaGPT\u2019 in this chunk. Return only the number.\u201d\n- Summation happens in Python (e.g., `sum(counts)`).  \n2. **Error Propagation**:\n- **Refine**: Errors in one chunk (e.g., miscounting) carry forward, as each refinement depends on the previous answer.\n- **Chunk Processing**: Errors are isolated to individual chunks, as counts are summed afterward. This makes debugging easier (e.g., reprocess a single chunk).  \n3. **Flexibility**:\n- **Refine**: Tightly coupled to LlamaIndex\u2019s query engine framework. You configure it via `response_mode=\"refine\"`, limiting customization.\n- **Chunk Processing**: More flexible, as you can write a custom loop over nodes, tailoring the prompt or logic (e.g., batching multiple chunks per LLM call).  \n4. **Efficiency**:\n- **Refine**: Requires ~977 LLM calls (one per chunk), with each call including the current answer and prompt overhead.\n- **Chunk Processing**: Also requires ~977 calls but can optimize by batching (e.g., sending 5 chunks per call, if the context window allows) or simplifying the prompt.  \n5. **Implementation Complexity**:\n- **Refine**: Simpler to implement within LlamaIndex, as it\u2019s a built-in mode. You just set `response_mode=\"refine\"` and craft a counting prompt.\n- **Chunk Processing**: Requires custom code to iterate over nodes, collect counts, and sum them, but it\u2019s still straightforward.  \n#### **Which Is Better?**\n- **Refine**:\n- **Best for**: If you want a quick, out-of-the-box solution within LlamaIndex\u2019s query engine framework, and you\u2019re comfortable with potential error propagation.\n- **Advantages**: Leverages existing `response_mode`, requires minimal custom code, integrates seamlessly with your Router Engine.\n- **Drawbacks**: Risk of cumulative errors, less flexible, slightly less efficient due to prompt overhead.\n- **Chunk Processing**:\n- **Best for**: If you prioritize accuracy, flexibility, and optimization (e.g., batching chunks or debugging individual counts).\n- **Advantages**: Isolates errors, allows batching, easier to debug or extend (e.g., counting variations of \u201cMetaGPT\u201d).\n- **Drawbacks**: Requires more custom code (e.g., a loop over nodes), slightly more setup.  \nGiven your requirement for an LLM-based approach and the large document size, **both methods are viable**, but `refine` is simpler to implement within your existing code, while chunk processing offers better accuracy and flexibility. Since you asked specifically about `refine`, let\u2019s assume you prefer the simpler approach and evaluate it further.  \n---",

Update the total count and return only the number.\u201d\n- This ensures the LLM adds the new chunk\u2019s count to the running total.  \n4. **Router Engine Integration**:\n- Wrap the `refine`-based query engine in a `QueryEngineTool`:\n- Description: \u201cUseful for counting specific terms in the MetaGPT document.\u201d\n- Add it to your `RouterQueryEngine`\u2019s `query_engine_tools` list.\n- Query: \u201cCount the number of times MetaGPT is mentioned.\u201d\n- The `LLMSingleSelector` routes it to the counting tool.  \n5. **Output**:\n- After processing ~977 chunks, the LLM returns the final count (e.g., \u201cMetaGPT is mentioned 42 times\u201d).  \n6. **Optimizations**:\n- **Chunk Size**: If 1024 tokens strains the context window (due to prompt overhead), reduce to 512 (~1,953 chunks) or test with 2048 (~488 chunks) if GPT-3.5-turbo\u2019s 16K limit allows.\n- **Async Processing**: Ensure `use_async=True` to parallelize LLM calls where possible.\n- **Validation**: Sample a few chunks manually or cross-check with a non-LLM count (if feasible) to verify accuracy.  \n---",

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in\nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the\nrequirements described in OSFI\u2019s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .",

Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:\n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and\n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n11.

The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents\nbooked in Canada.",

Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.\n22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a\nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting\nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\n8 Institutions that do not receive\napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23. An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative\nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk\n25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative\nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor):\n\u2022 The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions\nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution.\n\u2022 On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions\n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions \u2013 Implemen tation Note",

In the post -approval\nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted\nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n1. 5. Capital Floor \u2013Internal Model Based Approaches  \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based\ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty\ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital\nfloor ensures that institutions\u2019 capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set\nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.\nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk,\ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:\ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and\nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2.\n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]\n28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the\ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.\n1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and\noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:\ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less\nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital\nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline.",

Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for\nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for\nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets\nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:\nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\nWhere:\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2.\nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7.\n39.

One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are\ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in\nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor.

Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the\nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions\u2019 resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23]  \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47.

The distribution constraints\nincrease as institutions\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal.\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions\u2019 capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution\u2019s\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5%\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs\u2019 Total Loss\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage\nof earnings)\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80%\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60%\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40%\n>7.0%  0%\n50. If an institution\u2019s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution\u2019s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution\u2019s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .",

Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions:\n(a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;\n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and\n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion\nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52.

Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be\nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer\n53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take\naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed\nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide\nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential\nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements:\n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor\ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and\nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when  \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (\u201cFISC\u201d), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides informat ion that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national\nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures.

In addition, institutions are not e xpected to\nreplicate sectoral buffers or similar measures adopted by foreign jurisdictions that depart from\nthe internationally agreed countercyclical buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must\nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements.

Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33  \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB\u2019s total RWA calculated\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with\nCET1 c apital.\n69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI\u2019s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.  \n32   Details related to the OSFI\u2019s DSB are included on OSFI\u2019s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions",

D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process.\nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a\nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS).  \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In\nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between\nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions\u2019 ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs\u2019\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n1. 10.  Capital Targets\n74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1,\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1,\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs\u2019 target capital ratios would be at least 10% for\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB\nsurcharge of 1.0%.",

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution\u2019s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \nSize\n2. In general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;\n\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and\n\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \nInter -connections\n3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform\ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e.\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.  \nSubstitutability  \n4. The systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial  \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)",

The largest\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the\nrange of evidence are the following:\n\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and\n\u2022 The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.  \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way,\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.  \n7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial  \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks",

The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate\ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic\npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given:\n\u2022 extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and\n\u2022 current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers \u2013 features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:\n\u2022 Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%)\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and\n\u2022 the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.\nRelationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework\n9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee\u2019s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43\nSupervisory Implications\n10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the  \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20\n43   Details related to G -SIB\u2019s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI\u2019s Global Systemically\nImportant Banks \u2013 Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory\n44  OSFI\u2019s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)",
