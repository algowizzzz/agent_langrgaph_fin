```

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write unit tests for new components
2. Implement component to pass tests  
3. Add integration tests for workflows
4. Validate with business scenarios
5. Run performance regression tests

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**
```bash
# Ensure proper Python path
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:."
```

**Mock Setup Issues**
- Verify mock patches match actual module structure
- Check async/sync function compatibility
- Ensure mock return values match expected formats

**Performance Test Failures**
- Check system resources during test execution
- Verify no other processes consuming CPU/memory
- Consider adjusting thresholds for different environments

### Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Clean test environment
rm -rf test_plan/test_results/
mkdir -p test_plan/test_results/

# Reset state
rm -rf ./orchestrator_state/
```
