The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:', 'metadata': {'source': 'uploads/c132579d-416d-4178-bdca-c94b97bb076e/8726afa4-554d-42b9-b257-3d06e663b941_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '8726afa4-554d-42b9-b257-3d06e663b941_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'chunk_index': 69}}, {'page_content': 'consolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks.

A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.', 'metadata': {'source': 'uploads/c132579d-416d-4178-bdca-c94b97bb076e/8726afa4-554d-42b9-b257-3d06e663b941_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '8726afa4-554d-42b9-b257-3d06e663b941_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'chunk_index': 73}}, {'page_content': '• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\n  \n 7.

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \n 11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:  \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;   \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n• own-use property, plant and equipment  \n 12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:  \n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n• accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations  \n 13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA.

The guideline, developed in alignment with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision framework, establishes two key minimum standards: the leverage ratio and the risk-based capital ratio. The document is structured into nine comprehensive chapters covering various aspects of capital requirements, including definition of capital, operational risk, credit risk (both standardized and internal ratings-based approaches), securitization, settlement and counterparty risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and market risk.\n\nThe framework specifies that total capital consists of Tier 1 (including Common Equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1) and Tier 2 capital, with risk-weighted assets (RWA) serving as the denominator in risk-based capital ratios. Institutions must calculate their RWA as the higher of either the sum of credit risk, market risk, and operational risk, or the adjusted RWA determined by the capital floor. For institutions with total regulatory capital exceeding CAD $5 billion or significant international exposure (over 10% of assets or liabilities), Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approaches are expected for material portfolios in Canada and the United States.

An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \n \n \n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implemen tation Note\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 9\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n \n \n1. 5. Capital Floor –Internal Model Based Approaches  \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk,\n\n--- Document Section ---\nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 10\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \nFiscal year  \n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \n \n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of\n\n--- Document Section ---\n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter 4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this guideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \n \n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. After November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.   34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline.  35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \ncalculation of the capital floor:  \na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \nb.

The guideline details specific approaches for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA) across credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. For market risk, requirements apply primarily to internationally active institutions and D-SIBs, with institutions needing to identify trading book instruments and calculate RWA using either standardized or internal models approaches. Operational risk requirements apply to all institutions, with D-SIBs and larger SMSBs (reporting adjusted gross income over $1.5 billion) required to use the standardized approach, while smaller institutions must use the simplified standardized approach unless otherwise approved.\n\nThe framework introduces a robust capital floor requirement for institutions using internal model-based approaches, designed to reduce excessive RWA variability and enhance risk-based capital ratio comparability. This floor is being phased in over three years, starting at 65% in 2023 and reaching 72.5% by 2026, though OSFI may adjust these levels for individual institutions. To obtain approval for internal models (IRB, IMM, or IMA), institutions must meet strict qualitative and quantitative requirements, including the IRB use test principles and approximately 80% coverage of consolidated credit exposures for IRB implementation. The calculation methodology for the capital floor explicitly excludes certain approaches, including the IRB approach to credit risk, SEC-IRBA, the IMA for market risk, and the VaR models approach to counterparty credit risk, while requiring standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk, and market risk components.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted.

[Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \n \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital.

The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).

For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions.

If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements.

Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \nrestricted from making positive net distributions.

Institutions must maintain minimum risk-based capital ratios of 4.5% for CET1, 6.0% for Tier 1, and 8.0% for Total capital, calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets (RWA). The framework includes specific calculations for different institution categories, with Category III SMSBs using a Simplified Risk-Based Capital Ratio (SRBCR). Total RWA is determined by multiplying capital requirements for market risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding these to credit risk RWA. The adjusted capital requirement incorporates various elements including provisioning shortfall deductions and excess provisions in Tier 2 capital.\n\nIn addition to minimum requirements, institutions must maintain capital buffers to enhance resilience during economic downturns. The capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWA can only be met with CET1 capital, bringing the total minimum requirements to 7.0% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, and 10.5% Total capital. When capital levels fall within the buffer conservation range, institutions face graduated restrictions on distributions (including dividends, share buybacks, and discretionary bonus payments), with conservation ratios ranging from 40% to 100% of earnings depending on CET1 levels. These constraints are designed to ensure capital preservation during stress periods, with institutions expected to implement capital restoration plans when buffers are depleted. The framework emphasizes that stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk of recovery, and institutions cannot use capital distributions to signal financial strength when buffers are depleted.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

The framework includes specific calculations for different institution categories and requires institutions to maintain capital buffers, including a 2.5% capital conservation buffer that can only be met with CET1 capital. When capital levels fall within the buffer conservation range, institutions face graduated restrictions on distributions, with conservation ratios ranging from 40% to 100% of earnings depending on CET1 levels. Additionally, six designated Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) - including Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto-Dominion Bank - must maintain an additional 1% CET1 surcharge.\n\nThe framework also includes a countercyclical buffer regime ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets, designed to protect the banking system against excessive aggregate credit growth and system-wide risks. OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee (SAC) partners, monitors credit growth and other indicators to determine when to implement or release this buffer. For institutions with international exposures, the countercyclical buffer is calculated as a weighted average based on the geographic location of private sector credit exposures across jurisdictions. Private sector credit exposures are determined on an ultimate risk basis, excluding interbank and public sector exposures. Implementation of buffer increases requires 6-12 months' notice, while decreases can take immediate effect. Institutions must publicly disclose their buffer calculations and geographic breakdown of relevant exposures with the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

Domestic Stability Buffer  \n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \nCommittee (FISC) .\n33\n\n--- Document Section ---\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33 \n \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB’s total RWA calculated \nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \nCET1 c apital.  \n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI’s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \n \n \n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 20\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \n \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could \nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n \n72.

In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n \n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\n\n--- Document Section ---\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n  \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.  \n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \nsurcharge of 1.0%.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 21\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 21 Table 8: Target Capital Ratios  \n \n SMSBs  D-SIBs  \nTarget CET1 capital  7.0%  8.0% plus DSB  \nTarget Tier 1 capital  8.5%  9.5% plus DSB  \nTarget Total capital  10.5%  11.5%  plus DSB  \n \n75. These targets are applicable to all institutions and are triggers for supervisory intervention \nconsistent with OSFI’s Guide to Intervention.37 If an institution is offside the relevant target ratios, \nsupervisory action will be taken proportional to the shortfall and circumstances that caused the shortfall and may include a range of actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on distribu tions.  \n 76. The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions or \ngroups of institutions where circumstances warrant, including in respect of idiosyncratic and/or systemic risks that are not adequately captured by institutions ’ Pillar I capital requirements and \nbuffers. The need for Pillar II capital and corresponding higher target capital ratios would consider how robust existing capital ratios are in light of an institution’s allowances, stress testing program, and ICAAP results .\n38  \n \n \n37  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n38  For OSFI’s expectations refer to Guideline E -18: Stress Testing  and Guideline E -19: Internal Capital Adequac y \nAssessment Process (ICAAP) . \n\n\n## Page 22\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 22 Annex 1   Domestic Systemic Importance and Capital Targets  \n \n1. The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\n--- Document Section ---\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability  \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\n\n--- Document Section ---\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 23\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\n  \n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets\n\n--- Document Section ---\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks\n</new_information>\n\nInstructions:\n- Integrate insights from ALL document sections above\n- Maintain consistency with the existing analysis\n- Ensure comprehensive coverage of the new information\n- Create a unified, well-structured response"}], 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'temperature': 0.3}}

The framework includes specific requirements for different institution categories, with six designated Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) - Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto-Dominion Bank - subject to additional requirements. These D-SIBs must maintain not only the standard 2.5% capital conservation buffer and 1% D-SIB surcharge, but also a Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) ranging from 0% to 4.0% of total risk-weighted assets. The DSB, reviewed semi-annually, addresses systemic vulnerabilities not captured in Pillar 1 requirements and must be met with CET1 capital. This results in target capital ratios for D-SIBs of at least 8% for CET1, 9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital, plus the applicable DSB.\n\nThe designation of D-SIBs is based on comprehensive assessment criteria including size, interconnectedness, and substitutability within the Canadian financial system. These six banks collectively account for over 90% of total banking assets and play crucial roles in domestic financial markets and infrastructures, including the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS), and CDSX. Some also serve essential functions in international systems like CLS Bank for foreign exchange settlements. The framework includes a countercyclical buffer regime ranging from 0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, designed to protect against excessive credit growth and system-wide risks. While breaching the DSB doesn't trigger automatic distribution constraints, it requires a remediation plan, and institutions must publicly disclose their buffer calculations and maintain target capital ratios that include all applicable buffers.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n Supervisory Implications  \n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\n\n--- Document Section ---\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 25\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \ndisclosure practices;  \n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;\n\n--- Document Section ---\nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\n45  \n Information Disclosure Practices  \n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions’ risk models and risk management \npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \n \n \n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \nImportant Financial Institutions .

The framework\'s effectiveness is supported by historical data showing that extreme loss events among D-SIBs over the past 25 years would be adequately covered by the combination of the 2.5% CET1 capital conservation buffer and 1% surcharge. Canadian D-SIBs are notably more resilient due to their business models, which favor retail funding over wholesale funding and have less exposure to investment banking risks compared to international peers. The framework includes both D-SIB and G-SIB considerations, with institutions designated as both required to maintain the higher of the two surcharges (G-SIB surcharges range from 1% to 3.5% RWA). This structure, combined with the convertibility of Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments (2% to 3%) to common equity during crises, significantly enhances the banks\' loss absorption capacity.\n\nOSFI implements enhanced supervision for D-SIBs through multiple channels, including extensive use of supervisory colleges, increased monitoring frequency, and specialized expertise in various risk areas. The supervision framework emphasizes cross-institution reviews, external benchmarking, and regular stress testing to ensure robust risk management practices. D-SIBs are expected to maintain industry-leading public disclosure practices, including adoption of Financial Stability Board\'s Enhanced Disclosure Task Force recommendations and evolving international standards. The framework includes comprehensive recovery and resolution planning, with OSFI leading recovery plan assessments while the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation oversees resolution plans. This intensive supervision reflects the D-SIBs\' crucial role in the Canadian financial system and ensures their continued stability and resilience against various market conditions.\n\n📊 DOCUMENT CONTENT (85 sections):\nSection 1: ## Page 1\nSection 2: Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 1 \nGuideline  \n \nSubject:  Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR)  \n \nChapter 1 – Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n \nEffective Date: November 2023 / January 2024  Note:  For institutions with a fiscal year ending October 31 or December 31, respectively.  \n  Subsections 485(1) and 949(1) of the Bank Act  (BA), subsection 473(1) of the Trust and Loan \nCompanies Act  (TLCA) require banks (inc\nSection 3: this guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution\'s \ncapital.

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:', 'metadata': {'source': 'uploads/session_1754081448282_u6s1rtc2p/75a6566f-20b7-4512-9923-9e4a902507e2_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '75a6566f-20b7-4512-9923-9e4a902507e2_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'chunk_index': 69}}, {'page_content': 'consolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks.

A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.', 'metadata': {'source': 'uploads/session_1754081448282_u6s1rtc2p/75a6566f-20b7-4512-9923-9e4a902507e2_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '75a6566f-20b7-4512-9923-9e4a902507e2_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'chunk_index': 73}}, {'page_content': '• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks.

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \n 11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:  \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;   \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n• own-use property, plant and equipment  \n 12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:  \n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n• accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations  \n 13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA.

The guideline, developed in alignment with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision framework, establishes two key minimum standards: the leverage ratio and the risk-based capital ratio. The document is structured into nine comprehensive chapters covering various aspects of capital requirements, including definition of capital, operational risk, credit risk, securitization, settlement and counterparty risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and market risk. The requirements apply on a consolidated basis to institutions designated as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and small and medium-sized deposit-taking institutions (SMSBs).\n\nThe framework details that total capital consists of Tier 1 capital (including Common Equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1) and Tier 2 capital, with risk-weighted assets (RWA) serving as the denominator in risk-based capital ratios. The RWA calculation encompasses credit risk, market risk, and operational risk components, with specific provisions for institutions exceeding CAD $5 billion in regulatory capital or having significant international exposure. The guideline provides detailed methodologies for calculating various risk exposures, including standardized and internal ratings-based approaches, and includes specific requirements for measuring exposures in both banking and trading books, with particular attention to counterparty credit risk and complex financial transactions.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

Approval to use Internal Model Based Approaches  \n \n21. Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n 22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime.

An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \n \n \n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implemen tation Note\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 9\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n \n \n1. 5. Capital Floor –Internal Model Based Approaches  \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk,\n\n--- Document Section ---\nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 10\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \nFiscal year  \n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \n \n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of\n\n--- Document Section ---\n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter 4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this guideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \n \n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. After November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.   34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline.  35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \ncalculation of the capital floor:  \na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \nb. SEC-IRBA;\n\n--- Document Section ---\ncalculation of the capital floor:  \na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \nb.

The guideline details comprehensive requirements across multiple risk categories: credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Market risk requirements specifically apply to internationally active institutions and D-SIBs, while operational risk requirements apply to all institutions, with D-SIBs and larger SMSBs (reporting adjusted gross income above $1.5 billion) required to use the Standardized Approach. The framework mandates explicit prior approval from OSFI for institutions to use internal model-based approaches, including the Foundation and Advanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the Internal Model Method (IMM) for counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) for market risk. Institutions must demonstrate substantial compliance and provide back-testing and parallel reporting consistent with OSFI's implementation notes to receive approval.\n\nA significant feature of the framework is the capital floor requirement for institutions using internal model-based approaches, designed to reduce excessive RWA variability and enhance risk-based capital ratio comparability. The capital floor ensures that capital requirements don't fall below a certain percentage of standardized approach requirements, with an adjustment factor that phases in from 65% in 2023 to 72.5% by 2026. The calculation encompasses standardized approaches to credit risk, operational risk, and market risk, with specific provisions for credit risk mitigation and counterparty credit risk exposures. Notably, certain approaches are explicitly prohibited in the capital floor calculation, including the IRB approach to credit risk, SEC-IRBA, the IMA for market risk, and the VaR models approach to counterparty credit risk. Institutions achieving approval with conditions for model-based approaches may initially face higher capital floors until full compliance with rollout and data requirements is achieved.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets.

Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45.

[Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \n \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital.

The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n\n--- Document Section ---\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs’ Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings)  \n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \n>7.0%  0% \n 50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\n\n--- Document Section ---\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 15\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \nrestricted from making positive net distributions.

Institutions must maintain minimum CET1 (4.5%), Tier 1 (6.0%), and Total capital (8.0%) ratios, calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The framework encompasses credit risk, operational risk, and market risk requirements, with total RWA determined by multiplying market and operational risk capital requirements by 12.5 and adding these to credit risk RWA. For Category III SMSBs, a Simplified Risk-Based Capital Ratio (SRBCR) applies, using adjusted total assets rather than RWA. The framework maintains strict requirements for internal model-based approaches, requiring OSFI's explicit prior approval for methods such as IRB Approaches, IMM for counterparty credit risk, and IMA for market risk.\n\nA key feature of the framework is the mandatory capital buffer system, including a 2.5% capital conservation buffer above minimum requirements that must be met with CET1 capital, bringing the total minimum requirements to 7.0% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, and 10.5% Total capital. When capital levels fall within the buffer conservation range, institutions face graduated restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends, share buybacks, and discretionary bonus payments. The conservation ratio constraints increase as capital levels approach minimum requirements, ranging from 0% restriction above 7.0% CET1 to 100% restriction between 4.5-5.125% CET1. Institutions must implement capital restoration plans when buffers are depleted, with greater emphasis on rebuilding buffers the more they have been depleted. The framework explicitly prohibits institutions from using future recovery predictions to justify generous distributions when buffers are depleted, ensuring that stakeholders rather than depositors bear the risk of recovery.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate.

The framework includes a comprehensive buffer system, with a 2.5% capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer ranging from 0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The countercyclical buffer, implemented in consultation with the Senior Advisory Committee (SAC), aims to protect the banking system against excess aggregate credit growth and system-wide risks. Institutions must calculate their consolidated countercyclical buffer requirement as a weighted average based on their geographic private sector credit exposures, with weights determined by the proportion of credit risk RWA in each jurisdiction. Private sector credit exposures are evaluated on an ultimate risk basis, excluding interbank and public sector exposures.\n\nThe framework includes additional requirements for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), with six designated Canadian institutions subject to a 1% CET1 surcharge: Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto-Dominion Bank. When capital levels fall within buffer ranges, institutions face graduated restrictions on capital distributions, with conservation ratios ranging from 0% to 100% depending on the CET1 level. OSFI provides advance notice of 6-12 months for buffer increases, while buffer reductions typically take immediate effect. Institutions must ensure their countercyclical buffer calculations are publicly disclosed at least as frequently as their minimum capital requirements, including geographic breakdowns of private sector credit exposures used in the calculations. The framework maintains strict requirements for internal model-based approaches and emphasizes the importance of maintaining adequate capital buffers to protect against system-wide risks.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

Domestic Stability Buffer  \n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \nCommittee (FISC) .\n33\n\n--- Document Section ---\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33 \n \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB’s total RWA calculated \nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \nCET1 c apital.  \n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI’s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \n \n \n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 20\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \n \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could \nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \n \n72.

In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n \n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\n\n--- Document Section ---\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n  \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.  \n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \nsurcharge of 1.0%.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 21\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 21 Table 8: Target Capital Ratios  \n \n SMSBs  D-SIBs  \nTarget CET1 capital  7.0%  8.0% plus DSB  \nTarget Tier 1 capital  8.5%  9.5% plus DSB  \nTarget Total capital  10.5%  11.5%  plus DSB  \n \n75. These targets are applicable to all institutions and are triggers for supervisory intervention \nconsistent with OSFI’s Guide to Intervention.37 If an institution is offside the relevant target ratios, \nsupervisory action will be taken proportional to the shortfall and circumstances that caused the shortfall and may include a range of actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on distribu tions.  \n 76. The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions or \ngroups of institutions where circumstances warrant, including in respect of idiosyncratic and/or systemic risks that are not adequately captured by institutions ’ Pillar I capital requirements and \nbuffers. The need for Pillar II capital and corresponding higher target capital ratios would consider how robust existing capital ratios are in light of an institution’s allowances, stress testing program, and ICAAP results .\n38  \n \n \n37  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n38  For OSFI’s expectations refer to Guideline E -18: Stress Testing  and Guideline E -19: Internal Capital Adequac y \nAssessment Process (ICAAP) . \n\n\n## Page 22\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 22 Annex 1   Domestic Systemic Importance and Capital Targets  \n \n1. The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\n--- Document Section ---\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability  \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\n\n--- Document Section ---\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 23\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\n  \n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets\n\n--- Document Section ---\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks\n</new_information>\n\nInstructions:\n- Integrate insights from ALL document sections above\n- Maintain consistency with the existing analysis\n- Ensure comprehensive coverage of the new information\n- Create a unified, well-structured response"}], 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'temperature': 0.3}}

For Small and Medium-Sized Banks (SMSBs), target ratios are set at 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, and 10.5% Total capital. Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) face additional requirements, including a 1% CET1 surcharge and a Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) ranging from 0% to 4.0% of risk-weighted assets. The DSB, reviewed semi-annually in June and December, is designed to address systemic vulnerabilities not captured in Pillar 1 requirements. Unlike other buffers, DSB breaches don't trigger automatic distribution constraints but require a remediation plan. D-SIBs must maintain higher target ratios of at least 8% CET1, 9.5% Tier 1, and 11.5% Total capital, plus the applicable DSB.\n\nSix Canadian institutions have been designated as D-SIBs based on comprehensive criteria including size, interconnectedness, and substitutability: Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto-Dominion Bank. These institutions collectively account for over 90% of total banking assets and play crucial roles in domestic financial markets and infrastructures, including the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS), Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS), and CDSX. When capital levels fall within buffer ranges, D-SIBs face graduated conservation ratios from 40% to 100% based on their CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions based on idiosyncratic or systemic risks, considering factors such as stress testing results and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) outcomes.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n Supervisory Implications  \n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\n\n--- Document Section ---\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 25\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \ndisclosure practices;  \n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;\n\n--- Document Section ---\nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\n45  \n Information Disclosure Practices  \n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions’ risk models and risk management \npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \n \n \n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \nImportant Financial Institutions .

The D-SIB framework includes a 1% capital surcharge, justified by historical analysis showing extreme loss events among this peer group over 25 years would be less than the combined CET1 capital conservation buffer (2.5%) and the additional 1%. Canadian D-SIBs are considered more resilient due to their retail-focused business models and less exposure to investment banking risks compared to international peers. For D-SIBs also designated as Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), the higher of the D-SIB or G-SIB surcharge (ranging from 1% to 3.5% RWA) applies, with additional loss absorbency provided by the potential conversion of 2-3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments to common equity during crisis scenarios.\n\nOSFI implements enhanced supervision for D-SIBs through multiple mechanisms, including extensive use of supervisory colleges, increased monitoring frequency, and specialized expertise in various risk areas. This supervision encompasses regular stress testing, cross-institution reviews, and external benchmarking of risk-control practices. D-SIBs must maintain sophisticated oversight functions and internal controls, with expectations for continuous improvement as international best practices evolve. They are also required to adopt leading public disclosure practices, including implementing recommendations from the Financial Stability Board\'s Enhanced Disclosure Task Force and other international standards. The framework includes comprehensive recovery and resolution planning, with OSFI leading recovery plan assessments while the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation oversees resolution plans. The Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB), reviewed semi-annually and set between 0% to 4.0% of risk-weighted assets, provides additional flexibility to address systemic vulnerabilities.\n\n📊 DOCUMENT CONTENT (85 sections):\nSection 1: ## Page 1\nSection 2: Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 1 \nGuideline  \n \nSubject:  Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR)  \n \nChapter 1 – Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n \nEffective Date: November 2023 / January 2024  Note:  For institutions with a fiscal year ending October 31 or December 31, respectively.  \n  Subsections 485(1) and 949(1) of the Bank Act  (BA), subsection 473(1) of the Trust and Loan \nCompanies Act  (TLCA) require banks (inc\nSection 3: this guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution\'s \ncapital.

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importa\nSection 71: consolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3.

As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability.

This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of \nSection 76: ahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress.

The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy.

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:', 'metadata': {'source': 'uploads/session_1754081448282_u6s1rtc2p/75a6566f-20b7-4512-9923-9e4a902507e2_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '75a6566f-20b7-4512-9923-9e4a902507e2_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'chunk_index': 69}}, {'page_content': 'consolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks.

This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks.

Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \n 11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:  \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;   \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n• own-use property, plant and equipment  \n 12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:  \n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and  \n• accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations  \n 13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA.

The guideline, developed in alignment with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision framework, establishes two key minimum standards: the leverage ratio and the risk-based capital ratio. The document is structured into nine comprehensive chapters covering various aspects of capital requirements, including definition of capital, operational risk, credit risk approaches, securitization, settlement and counterparty risk, credit valuation adjustment risk, and market risk. The requirements apply on a consolidated basis to institutions designated as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) and small and medium-sized deposit-taking institutions (SMSBs).\n\nThe framework details that total capital consists of Tier 1 capital (including Common Equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1) and Tier 2 capital, with risk-weighted assets (RWA) serving as the denominator in risk-based capital ratios. The RWA calculation encompasses credit risk, market risk, and operational risk components, with specific provisions for institutions exceeding CAD $5 billion in regulatory capital or having significant international exposure. The guideline provides detailed methodologies for calculating various risk exposures, including standardized and internal ratings-based approaches, and includes specific requirements for measuring exposures in both banking and trading books, with particular attention to counterparty credit risk and complex financial transactions.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n 22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\n8 Institutions that do not receive \napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23.

An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \n \n \n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implemen tation Note\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 9\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n \n \n1. 5. Capital Floor –Internal Model Based Approaches  \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk,\n\n--- Document Section ---\nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 10\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \nFiscal year  \n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \n \n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of\n\n--- Document Section ---\n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter 4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this guideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \n \n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. After November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.   34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline.  35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \ncalculation of the capital floor:  \na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \nb.

The guideline details comprehensive requirements across credit risk, market risk, and operational risk categories. Market risk requirements specifically apply to internationally active institutions and D-SIBs, while operational risk requirements apply to all institutions, with D-SIBs and larger SMSBs (reporting adjusted gross income above $1.5 billion) required to use the standardized approach. Institutions must obtain explicit prior approval from OSFI to implement internal model-based approaches, including the Foundation and Advanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the Internal Model Method (IMM) for counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) for market risk. For IRB credit risk approval, institutions must demonstrate compliance with use test principles and implement the approach for approximately 80% of their consolidated credit exposures.\n\nThe framework introduces a capital floor requirement for institutions using internal model-based approaches to ensure capital requirements don't fall below a certain percentage of standardized approach requirements. The floor adjustment factor is being phased in over three years, starting at 65% in 2023 and increasing to 72.5% by 2026. The calculation of the capital floor encompasses standardized approaches to credit risk and operational risk, with specific provisions for market risk calculation. Notably, certain approaches are explicitly prohibited in the capital floor calculation, including the IRB approach to credit risk, SEC-IRBA, the IMA for market risk, and the VaR models approach to counterparty credit risk. The framework maintains flexibility for OSFI to set higher or lower adjustment factors for individual institutions and includes specific requirements for measuring exposures in both banking and trading books.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.20]\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 13\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 13 44. When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In \nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions\n\n--- Document Section ---\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions \nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \n \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of RWA .\n13 Table 4 provides the minimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conversation buffer. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.2]   \n \nTable 4: Capital conservation buffer (as % of RWA)  \nCapital conservation buffer  2.5%  \nMinimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer  \nCET1  7.0%  \nTier 1  8.5%  \nTotal  10.5%  \n 48.

Capital distribution constraints will be imposed on an institution when capital levels fall \nwithin the buffer conservation range. Institutions will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall within the buffer range as they experience losses. The constraints imposed \n \n12    Applies only to performance bonuses issued to institutions’ senior management. The term “senior management”  \nis defined in OSFI’s Corporate Governance Guideline .  \n13   For Category  III SMSBs, the capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of [Adjusted Total Assets +  \nRWA Operational Risk ]\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 14\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 14 relate only to distributions, not the operations of the institution. The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n\n--- Document Section ---\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs’ Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings)  \n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \n>7.0%  0% \n 50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\n\n--- Document Section ---\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements.

The framework requires minimum risk-based capital ratios of 4.5% for CET1, 6.0% for Tier 1, and 8.0% for Total capital, calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. For D-SIBs and Category I/II SMSBs, total risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying capital requirements for market and operational risk by 12.5 and adding these to credit risk-weighted assets. Category III SMSBs follow a Simplified Risk-Based Capital Ratio (SRBCR) using adjusted total assets. The framework requires institutions to obtain explicit prior approval from OSFI for internal model-based approaches, including the IRB Approaches for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, and IMA for market risk.\n\nThe framework mandates additional capital buffers beyond minimum requirements, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWA that can only be met with CET1 capital, bringing the total minimum requirements to 7.0% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, and 10.5% Total capital. When capital levels fall within the buffer conservation range, institutions face graduated restrictions on capital distributions, with conservation ratios ranging from 40% to 100% of earnings depending on CET1 levels. Distributions subject to constraints include dividends, share buybacks, discretionary payments on capital instruments, and staff bonus payments. The framework emphasizes that institutions should rebuild depleted buffers through retained earnings or new capital raising, with greater conservation efforts required as capital levels approach minimum requirements. Institutions must implement capital restoration plans when buffers are drawn down, and stakeholders rather than depositors must bear the risk of recovery.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate.

Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when \n \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance.

To give \ninstitutions time to adjust to a buffer level, OSFI will pre -announce its decision, to activate or \nraise the level of the countercyclical buffer, by up to 12 months but no less than 6 months. Conversely, decisions to release the countercyclical buffer will normally take effect immediately.

The framework includes a mandatory capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of RWA and a countercyclical buffer ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets, both of which must be met with CET1 capital. The countercyclical buffer, monitored by OSFI in consultation with the Senior Advisory Committee (SAC), aims to protect the banking system against excess aggregate credit growth and system-wide risks. For institutions with international exposures, the consolidated countercyclical buffer is calculated as a weighted average of buffers across jurisdictions where they have private sector credit exposures, with geographic location determined on an ultimate risk basis.\n\nThe framework implements additional requirements for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), with six designated Canadian institutions subject to a 1% CET1 surcharge of RWAs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto-Dominion Bank. When capital levels fall within buffer ranges, institutions face graduated restrictions on distributions, with conservation ratios from 40% to 100% of earnings depending on CET1 levels. The countercyclical buffer decisions are formally communicated with 6-12 months' notice for increases and immediate effect for decreases. Institutions must publicly disclose their buffer calculations and geographic breakdown of private sector credit exposures at least as frequently as their minimum capital requirements, with a maximum reciprocity requirement of 2.5% RWA for foreign jurisdictions' buffers.\n</existing_analysis>\n\nPlease refine this analysis with the new information below.

Domestic Stability Buffer  \n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \nCommittee (FISC) .\n33\n\n--- Document Section ---\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33 \n \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB’s total RWA calculated \nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \nCET1 c apital.  \n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI’s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \n \n \n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 20\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \n \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements.

In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n \n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios\n\n--- Document Section ---\nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n  \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.  \n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \nsurcharge of 1.0%.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 21\n\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 21 Table 8: Target Capital Ratios  \n \n SMSBs  D-SIBs  \nTarget CET1 capital  7.0%  8.0% plus DSB  \nTarget Tier 1 capital  8.5%  9.5% plus DSB  \nTarget Total capital  10.5%  11.5%  plus DSB  \n \n75.

The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions or \ngroups of institutions where circumstances warrant, including in respect of idiosyncratic and/or systemic risks that are not adequately captured by institutions ’ Pillar I capital requirements and \nbuffers. The need for Pillar II capital and corresponding higher target capital ratios would consider how robust existing capital ratios are in light of an institution’s allowances, stress testing program, and ICAAP results .\n38  \n \n \n37  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n38  For OSFI’s expectations refer to Guideline E -18: Stress Testing  and Guideline E -19: Internal Capital Adequac y \nAssessment Process (ICAAP) . \n\n\n## Page 22\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 22 Annex 1   Domestic Systemic Importance and Capital Targets  \n \n1. The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\n--- Document Section ---\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability  \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\n\n--- Document Section ---\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 23\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\n  \n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets\n\n--- Document Section ---\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy.

The DSB, reviewed semi-annually in June and December, addresses systemic vulnerabilities not captured in Pillar 1 requirements and must be met with CET1 capital. Unlike other buffers, DSB breaches don't trigger automatic distribution constraints but require a remediation plan. Target capital ratios for smaller and medium-sized banks (SMSBs) are set at 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, and 10.5% Total capital, while D-SIBs must maintain higher targets of 8% CET1, 9.5% Tier 1, and 11.5% Total capital, plus the applicable DSB.\n\nSix Canadian institutions have been designated as D-SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto-Dominion Bank.

The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\n\n--- Document Section ---\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n Supervisory Implications  \n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\n\n--- Document Section ---\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)\n\n--- Document Section ---\n## Page 25\n\n--- Document Section ---\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \ndisclosure practices;  \n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;\n\n--- Document Section ---\nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\n45  \n Information Disclosure Practices  \n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions’ risk models and risk management \npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \n \n \n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \nImportant Financial Institutions .

These D-SIBs, which account for over 90% of total banking assets, are subject to higher capital requirements including an 8% CET1 target (compared to 7% for smaller banks), reflecting their systemic importance. The framework\'s effectiveness is supported by historical data showing that extreme loss events among this peer group over 25 years would be less than the combined CET1 capital conservation buffer (2.5%) and an additional 1%. Canadian D-SIBs are notably more resilient due to their retail-focused business models and lower exposure to investment banking risks compared to international peers, with additional protection provided by the 2-3% convertible Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments.\n\nD-SIBs are subject to enhanced supervision and stringent regulatory oversight, including more intensive monitoring and higher operational standards. This includes extensive use of supervisory colleges, increased frequency of risk management monitoring, specialized expertise in various risk areas, cross-institution reviews, and regular stress testing. OSFI requires D-SIBs to maintain advanced practices in oversight functions and internal controls, with expectations for continuous improvement as international best practices evolve. For D-SIBs that are also designated as Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), the higher of the D-SIB or G-SIB surcharges (ranging from 1% to 3.5% RWA) applies. Additionally, D-SIBs must maintain leading public information disclosure practices, adopting recommendations from the Financial Stability Board\'s Enhanced Disclosure Task Force and other international standards, while also participating in recovery and resolution planning overseen by OSFI and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation respectively.\n\n📊 DOCUMENT CONTENT (85 sections):\nSection 1: ## Page 1\nSection 2: Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 1 \nGuideline  \n \nSubject:  Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR)  \n \nChapter 1 – Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n \nEffective Date: November 2023 / January 2024  Note:  For institutions with a fiscal year ending October 31 or December 31, respectively.  \n  Subsections 485(1) and 949(1) of the Bank Act  (BA), subsection 473(1) of the Trust and Loan \nCompanies Act  (TLCA) require banks (inc\nSection 3: this guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution\'s \ncapital.
