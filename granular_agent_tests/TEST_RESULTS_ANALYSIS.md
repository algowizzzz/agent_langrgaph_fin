# Granular Agent Test Results Analysis

This document provides a framework for analyzing the results of the end-to-end tests from a business perspective. A technically successful run (i.e., `status: "success"`) is not sufficient. The agent's output must be valuable, relevant, and directly address the user's query.

### **How to Analyze a Test Result**

For each test case, open the corresponding JSON file from the `testing/e2e_results/` directory and perform the following analysis:

#### **1. Review the `status` field.**

*   **Is the status "error"?**
    *   If yes, the test is an immediate and critical failure. The `final_answer` and `reasoning_log` will contain details about the error. From a business perspective, the agent has failed to perform its function.

#### **2. Scrutinize the `final_answer` field.**

This is the most important part of the analysis.

*   **Does the answer directly address the user's query?**
    *   For a summarization task, is it a summary?
    *   For a search task, does it present the search results?
*   **Is the answer accurate?**
    *   Does it correctly reflect the information present in the test document?
*   **Is the answer complete?**
    *   For a comprehensive summary, does it include all key themes?
    *   For a targeted search, does it find all relevant instances?
*   **Is the answer well-formatted and easy to understand?**
    *   If the user requested a bullet list, is the output a bullet list?
*   **Is the answer a generic refusal or an apology?**
    *   Responses like "I cannot answer that" or "The provided text is insufficient" are business failures, even if the status is "success". The agent must demonstrate its ability to work with the provided information.

#### **3. Examine the `reasoning_log` field.**

This provides insight into the agent's "thought process."

*   **Did the LLM create a logical plan?**
    *   Does the sequence of tool calls make sense for the user's query?
*   **Did each tool execute successfully?**
    *   Review the `tool_output` for each step. Does it look correct?
*   **Is the data flowing correctly between steps?**
    *   For a search-then-summarize task, is the output of the search tool being correctly passed as the input to the synthesis tool?

By following this structured analysis, you can ensure that the agent is not just technically functional, but also a valuable and reliable tool for its users.
