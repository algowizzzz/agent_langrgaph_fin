    "question": "What is Value at Risk (VaR)?",
    "answer": "Value at Risk (VaR) is a widely used statistical measure of risk in finance that quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a specific time period at a given confidence level. In simpler terms, it answers the question: \"How much could I lose on my investment over a specific time frame, with X% certainty?\"\n\nKey aspects of VaR:\n\n1. Time Period: VaR is always calculated for a specific time horizon (e.g., 1 day, 10 days, or 1 month)\n\n2. Confidence Level: Typically expressed at 95% or 99% confidence intervals\n\n3. Example: A one-day 95% VaR of $1 million means there is a 95% probability that the portfolio will not lose more than $1 million in one day\n\nCommon VaR calculation methods:\n- Historical Simulation\n- Variance-Covariance Method\n- Monte Carlo Simulation\n\nLimitations of VaR:\n- Does not indicate the size of potential losses beyond the VaR threshold\n- May not capture extreme market events effectively\n- Different calculation methods can produce varying results\n\nVaR is used by financial institutions, risk managers, and regulators as one of several tools for risk assessment and management.",
