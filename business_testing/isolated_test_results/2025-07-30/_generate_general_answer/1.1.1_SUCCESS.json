    "retrieved_context": [],
    "answer": "Debt and equity financing are two primary ways for businesses to raise capital, but they come with different implications for business owners and investors. Understanding the key differences between these two forms of financing is crucial for making informed decisions about how to fund business operations or expansion.\n\n**Debt Financing:**\n\n1. **Definition:** Debt financing involves borrowing funds from external sources with the promise to repay the principal amount along with interest over a specified period. This can include loans from banks, credit unions, or the issuance of bonds.\n\n2. **Ownership:** In debt financing, the lenders do not receive ownership stakes in the business. The relationship between the borrower and the lender is strictly financial.\n\n3. **Cost:** The cost of debt financing is the interest that must be paid to the lender, which is often tax-deductible.\n\n4. **Risk and Control:** While taking on debt increases a company's financial risk due to the obligation to make regular interest payments, it allows business owners to retain full control over their company.\n\n5. **Repayment:** Debt must be repaid at the end of the lending period, along with interest, regardless of the business's financial situation.\n\n**Equity Financing:**\n\n1. **Definition:** Equity financing involves raising capital by selling shares of the company. This can mean issuing new shares to the public or selling a portion of the business to investors.\n\n2. **Ownership:** Investors who purchase equity become co-owners of the business and gain a right to a portion of the profits, often received as dividends, and possibly a say in business decisions.\n\n3. **Cost:** Unlike debt financing, there is no obligation to repay investors. However, the original owners must share their profits and potentially cede some control over the business.\n\n4. **Risk and Control:** Equity financing can be less risky from a cash flow perspective, as there are no mandatory monthly payments. However, it dilutes the ownership and control of the original owners.\n\n5. **Repayment:** There is no \"repayment\" in the traditional sense with equity financing. Investors' returns are realized through dividends and the appreciation of their shares.\n\n**Choosing Between Debt and Equity Financing:**\n\nThe choice between debt and equity financing depends on several factors, including the company's stage of development, cash flow stability, the importance of maintaining control, and the cost and availability of each financing type. Often, businesses use a combination of both to balance the benefits and drawbacks of each.\n\nIf this question pertains to seeking specific advice or products related to BMO (Bank of Montreal) regarding debt or equity financing options, it would be best to directly contact BMO's financial advisors or the appropriate department within the bank.
