    "answer": "Value at Risk (VaR) is a widely used statistical measure of risk in finance that quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a specific time period at a given confidence level. \n\nKey aspects of VaR:\n\n1. Definition: VaR answers the question \"What is the maximum loss we can expect with X% confidence over Y time period?\"\n\n2. Components:\n- Confidence level (typically 95% or 99%)\n- Time horizon (e.g., 1 day, 10 days, or 1 month)\n- Currency/unit of measurement\n\n3. Common calculation methods:\n- Historical simulation\n- Variance-covariance method\n- Monte Carlo simulation\n\nFor example, if a portfolio has a one-day 95% VaR of $1 million, this means there is a 95% probability that the portfolio will not lose more than $1 million in one day.\n\nVaR is used by:\n- Financial institutions for risk management\n- Regulators for capital requirements\n- Investment managers for portfolio risk assessment\n\nLimitations:\n- Does not indicate the size of losses beyond the VaR threshold\n- May not capture extreme market conditions effectively\n- Different calculation methods can produce varying results",
