        "content": "Compound interest in savings accounts is a powerful concept that helps your money grow over time. It works by paying interest on both the initial principal amount deposited in your account and on the interest that has already been earned. This means you earn interest on interest, leading to potentially significant growth of your savings over time.\n\nHere\u2019s a simplified breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Initial Deposit**: You start by depositing a sum of money into your savings account. This is known as the principal.\n\n2. **Interest Calculation**: The bank pays interest on your principal at a certain rate, typically on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly basis. The rate at which your bank pays this interest is known as the annual percentage yield (APY).\n\n3. **Interest Addition**: After the first period of interest calculation, the interest earned is added to your principal, increasing the total amount in your account.\n\n4. **Compound Interest**: In the next period, interest is calculated on this new total (the original principal plus the previously earned interest). This process repeats each period, continually adding the interest earned to the principal and then calculating the next period\u2019s interest on the new total.\n\nThe frequency of compounding can significantly affect how much interest you earn. More frequent compounding periods (e.g., monthly vs. annually) can lead to higher returns, as interest is being calculated on a slightly larger amount more frequently.\n\nTo see the specific impact of compound interest on your savings in a BMO account or to understand the specific terms, interest rates, and compounding frequency offered, it would be best to contact BMO directly or refer to the terms and conditions of your savings account. Banks often provide online calculators or tools that can help you estimate the growth of your savings over time, taking compound interest into account.",
