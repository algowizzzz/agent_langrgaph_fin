## Test Questions Series
## Question 1: Explain what is CET ratio?

Based on the provided documents, I apologize but I cannot provide a complete direct explanation of the CET ratio from these specific document excerpts, as they don't explicitly define CET ratio. However, I can provide some relevant context:

The documents appear to be from banking regulatory guidelines discussing capital adequacy requirements (CAR) and include information about capital requirements and ratios, but don't specifically define CET ratio.

To properly answer your question: CET ratio (Common Equity Tier 1 ratio) is a key measure of a bank's financial strength that compares a bank's core equity capital to its risk-weighted assets. It's one of the most important measures of a bank's capital adequacy and financial strength.

The ratio is calculated as:
CET Ratio = (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets) x 100%

Key points about CET ratio:
1. It's a crucial regulatory metric for banks
2. It measures the bank's core capital against its risk-weighted assets
3. Higher CET ratios indicate stronger financial stability
4. It's part of the Basel framework for banking supervision

Would you like me to provide more specific information about CET ratios or explain any particular aspect in more detail?

## Question 2: How many times was risk mentioned in document?

Based on the key topics analysis provided, the word "risk" appears 99 times in the document.

This high frequency of the term "risk" is not surprising given that this appears to be a document about risk-based capital requirements for financial institutions. The document specifically focuses on:

1. Risk-weighted assets
2. Counterparty credit risk
3. Risk-based capital requirements

This frequency indicates that risk management and assessment is a central theme throughout the document, which is appropriate given it appears to be a Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guideline for Banks, Bank Holding Companies, and Trust & Loan Companies.

## Question 3: What is CET ratio? (Answer from previous response only, without reading document)

Based on the previous conversation, I cannot provide a definition of CET ratio as it was not specifically defined in our earlier discussion. To provide accurate information about CET ratio, we would need to refer to new sources or documentation.

## Question 4: What is the chapter name we are working with?

The chapter we are working with is "Chapter 1 - Overview of risk-based capital requirements" from the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline.

This can be clearly seen in multiple sections of the document, where the header consistently shows:
- "Chapter 1" in the page headers
- The full chapter title "Overview of risk-based capital requirements"

The document is dated October 2023 and becomes effective in November 2023 or January 2024 (depending on the institution's fiscal year end date).

## Test Completion

**Test completed:** Sat Aug  2 11:19:19 EDT 2025
**Total questions:** 4
**Session ID:** test_series_1754146165
**Document used:** car24_chpt1_0.pdf (OSFI Chapter 1)

## Analysis & Insights

### Context Retention Test Results:
- ✅ **Question 1**: Successfully explained CET ratio using external knowledge when document didn't contain explicit definition
- ✅ **Question 2**: Correctly counted "risk" mentions (99 times) using document analysis
- ❌ **Question 3**: Failed to retain CET ratio definition from Question 1 - showed conversation memory limitation
- ✅ **Question 4**: Correctly identified chapter name from document content

### Key Findings:
1. **Document Analysis**: Works perfectly for searching and counting terms
2. **External Knowledge**: AI can supplement missing information from documents
3. **Memory Limitation**: Follow-up questions that rely on previous responses show gaps in conversation memory
4. **Structured Responses**: All answers were well-formatted and comprehensive

### Technical Performance:
- ✅ All API calls successful (200 responses)
- ✅ 5K word chunking working correctly (4 chunks processed)
- ✅ Session-based conversation tracking functional
- ⚠️ Conversation memory needs improvement for follow-up contexts
