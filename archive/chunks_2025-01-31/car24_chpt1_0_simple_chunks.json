Scope of Application \n \n3. \nThe capital adequacy requirements outlined in this guideline apply on a consolidated \nbasis to the following institutions:  \na. all institutions designated by OSFI as domestic systemically important banks (D-\nSIBs); and \nb. small and medium-sized deposit-taking institutions (SMSBs4), which fall into \nCategories I, II or III as defined in OSFI\u2019s SMSB Capital and Liquidity \nRequirements Guideline.5  \n \n4. \nThe consolidated entity includes all subsidiaries except insurance subsidiaries. OSFI \nexpects institutions to hold capital within the consolidated group in a manner that is consistent \nwith the level and location of risk.   \n \n1. 2. Regulatory Capital \n \n5. \nTotal capital consists of the sum of the following elements: \ni. Tier 1 capital, consisting of: \na. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital; and \nb. Additional Tier 1 capital \nii. Tier 2 capital \n\n2    The Basel Framework  \n3  Following the format: [Basel Framework, XXX yy.zz] \n4    SMSBs are banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, \nand federally regulated loan companies that have not been designated by OSFI as domestic systemically \nimportant banks (D-SIBs). This includes subsidiaries of SMSBs or D-SIBs that are banks (including federal \ncredit unions), federally regulated trust companies or federally regulated loan companies. \n5    SMSB Capital and Liquidity Guideline \n\n=== PAGE 5 ===\n\nBanks/BHC/T&L \n \nOverview of risk-based capital requirements \n\nOctober 2023 \n \nChapter 1 - Page 5 \n6. \nThe criteria for the capital elements comprising the two tiers, as well as the various \nlimits, restrictions and regulatory adjustments to which they are subject, are described in \nChapter 2. \n \n1. 3. Total Risk-weighted Assets \n \n7. \nRisk-weighted assets (RWA) make up the denominator of the risk-based capital ratios, \nand is calculated as the higher of: \na. the sum of the following three elements: \ni. RWA for credit risk;  \nii. RWA for market risk; and \niii. RWA for operational risk; and \nb. the adjusted RWA determined as per the capital floor described in section 1.5. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.4] \n \n1.3.1. Credit Risk  \n \n8. RWA for credit risk (including counterparty credit risk) is calculated as the sum of: \na. Credit RWA for banking book exposures which, except the RWA listed in (b) \nthrough (e) below, is calculated using:  \n \ni. the standardized approach (as set out in Chapter 4); or \nii. the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach (as set out in Chapter 5).  \nb. RWA for counterparty credit risk from banking book exposures and trading book \nexposures (as set out in Chapter 7), except the exposures listed in (c) and (f) below. \nc. Credit RWA for equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book \ncalculated using one or more of the approaches set out in Chapter 4: \ni. The look-through approach \nii. The mandate-based approach \niii. The fall-back approach \nd. RWA for securitization exposures held in the banking book, calculating using one \nor more of the approaches set out in Chapter 6: \ni. Securitization Standardized Approach (SEC-SA) \nii. Securitization External Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA) \niii. Securitization Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) \niv.

RWA for exposures to central counterparties in the banking book and trading \nbook, calculated using the approach set out in Chapter 7.  \nf. RWA for the risk posed by unsettled transactions and failed trades, where the \ntransactions are in the banking book or trading book and are within the scope of \nthe rules set out in Chapter 7.  \ng. RWA for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk for exposures in the trading and \nbanking book, calculated as set out in Chapter 8 using either: \ni. The standardized approach for CVA; or \nii. The advanced approach for CVA.    \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.6] \n \n9. \nInstitutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that \nare international,6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \n10. \nUnder the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost: \n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and \n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income. \n \n11. \nUnder the standardized approach, on-balance sheet exposures should normally be \nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized \ncost: \n\u2022 loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;  \n\u2022 debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and \n\u2022 own-use property, plant and equipment \n \n12. \nFor own-use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of: \n\u2022 the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and \n\u2022 accumulated net after-tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \nresult of subsequent revaluations \n \n13. \nThe approaches listed in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the \nbanking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following \nmethods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of \nChapter 7 for an overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied): \n \n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non-residents \nbooked in Canada. \n\n=== PAGE 7 ===\n\nBanks/BHC/T&L \n \nOverview of risk-based capital requirements \n\nOctober 2023 \n \nChapter 1 - Page 7 \n \na. The standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (SA-\nCCR), set out in section 7.1.7. \nb. The comprehensive approach, set out in section 4.3.3(iii) of Chapter 4. \nc. The value at risk (VaR) models approach, set out in section 5.4.1(iii) of Chapter 5. \nd. The Internal Model Method (IMM), set out in section 7.1.5. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.7] \n \n14. \nFor banks with OSFI approval to use IMM to calculate counterparty credit risk \nexposures, EAD for counterparty credit risk exposures must be calculated according to sections \n7.1.3 through 7.1.5. [Basel Framework, RBC 20.8] \n \n1.3.2. Market Risk \n \n15. \nMarket risk requirements, as outlined in Chapter 9, apply to internationally active \ninstitutions and all institutions designated by OSFI as D-SIBs. OSFI retains the right to apply the \nframework to other institutions, on a case-by-case basis, if trading activities are a large \nproportion of overall operations. \n \n16. \nInstitutions subject to market risk requirements must identify the instruments that are in \nthe trading book following the requirements of Chapter 9. All instruments that are not in the \ntrading book and all other assets of the institution (termed \u201cbanking book exposures\u201d) must be \ntreated under one of the credit risk approaches. [Basel Framework, RBC 20.5] \n \n17. \nRWA for market risk are calculated as RWA for market risk for instruments in the \ntrading book and for foreign exchange risk and commodities risk for exposures in the banking \nbook, calculated using: \ni. \nThe standardized approach, as described in section 9.5; or \nii. \nThe internal models approach set out in section 9.6. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.9] \n \n1.3.3. Operational Risk  \n \n18. \nAll institutions are subject to operational risk requirements, as described in Chapter 3.  \n \n19. \nRWA for operational risk are calculated using either: \na. The Simplified Standardized Approach, set out in section 3.3; or \nb. The Standardized Approach, set out in section 3.4. \n \n20. \nD-SIBs and SMSBs that report adjusted gross income7 greater than $1.5 billion must \nuse the standardized approach. SMSBs with annual adjusted gross income less than $1.5 billion \nmust use the simplified standardized approach, unless they have received approval from OSFI to \nuse the standardized approach, as set out in section 3.2. \n \n7      Adjusted gross income is defined in section 3.3 \n\n=== PAGE 8 ===\n\nBanks/BHC/T&L \n \nOverview of risk-based capital requirements \n\nOctober 2023 \n \nChapter 1 - Page 8 \n \n1. 4. Approval to use Internal Model Based Approaches \n \n21. \nInstitutions must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \nfollowing model-based approaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal \nModels Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of \nthese approaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n \n22. \nOSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The \ninstitution must also be able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \nconsistent with OSFI's capital models implementation note.8 Institutions that do not receive \napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach. \n \n23. \nAn institution achieving approval with conditions for one of the model-based \napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI \nconfirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital \nfloor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has \nagreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In \neither case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or \nreviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. \nOnce approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting \nimplementation notes on an ongoing basis.",
