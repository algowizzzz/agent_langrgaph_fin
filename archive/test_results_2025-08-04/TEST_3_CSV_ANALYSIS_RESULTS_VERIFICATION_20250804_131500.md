## üîß **REMAINING OPTIMIZATIONS**

### **Query Classification Refinement**:
- Some query phrasings ("extract insights", "key insights") not triggering data analysis workflow
- Need to expand trigger keywords in `agent_identity.py`
- Consider workflow priority adjustments

### **Recommended Next Steps**:
1. **Expand Data Analysis Triggers** - Add "insights", "extract", "analyze" keywords
2. **Workflow Priority Review** - Ensure CSV documents always route to data analysis
3. **Query Preprocessing** - Normalize query language for better classification
