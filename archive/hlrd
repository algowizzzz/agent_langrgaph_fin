### Q&A Pod requirements

| Req ID | Requirement Title | Requirement Description | Location | Owner / Source | Priority | Acceptance Criteria | Implemented |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BFR-1.2 | Scope User Prompts | Finance user can ask a broad range of questions. The chatbot should be able to provide answers from its training knowledge base, BMO-specific context, and external sources in a transparent fashion. At a minimum, it should be able to cover, but not be limited to, the following broad categories of questions: <br> - **Type 1 question:** Ability to answer general questions that a finance user may ask as part of their day-to-day work. (e.g., what is net present value, how to calculate the duration of bonds, what are error correction models, what is GAAP, etc.). These are the kind of questions that should already be trained on. <br> - **Type 2 question:** Ability to answer general finance questions within the BMO context. This should require access to BMO's documents and exports from GL management reporting systems, etc. (Ex/ How does BMO use error correction models, what is the duration of equity for BBNA, what is BMO's policy on a particular type of accounting entry, etc.) <br> - **Type 3 question:** Ability to answer questions that require an internet search. This would still require access to internal data from peer banks and regulator websites. (Ex/ what does BMO's operating income look like when compared with TD Bank?) | Q&A | | | 1. Type 1 questions should be answered with already trained LLM knowledge. <br> 2. Type 2 questions must provide accurate answers using BMO-specific documents and data sources. <br> 3. Type 3 questions should utilize external websites and show the ability to synthesize data from allowed sites (assuming infrastructure and security approval). <br> 4. Links or citations used to create the answer by the LLM must be provided to the user. <br> 5. The retrieval process must be able to identify relevant documents. | Partial. Needs additional RAG sources. SharePoint and intranet already connected. Internet connection not implemented. List of websites to be confirmed for legal. |
| BFR-1.4 | Knowledge base sources | The Q&A pod should have access to the following knowledge bases: <br> a) BMO intranet <br> b) BMO SharePoint <br> c) Select internet "websites" <br> d) Knowledge base the LLM is trained on. <br> *Select websites are sources of referential information used for day-to-day work at BMO (e.g., regulatory information available at the federal registry, SEC EDGAR). | Q&A | Ash comment: | | 1. Validate connectivity and retrieval of data from the BMO intranet and specified SharePoint folders. <br> 2. Confirm the ability to access select websites based on BMO's approved list. <br> 3. Verify data retrieval from all specified SharePoint knowledge bases. <br> 4. Ability to generate answers when there is no relevant information in the knowledge bases based on the LLM training. | Partial: See BFR-1.2 |
| BFR-1.5 | Prioritization of retrieval source | Where multiple knowledge bases are engaged to respond to a prompt, Finance GPT should respond to a user prompt in the following sequence: <br> a) responses based on specified SharePoint folders <br> b) responses based on internal sources (intranet) <br> c) response based on core LLM training native to GPT. | Q&A | | | 1. Ensure the system correctly prioritizes response retrieval as per the defined order. <br> 2. Notify users about the knowledge base used for the response (example response: This answer is based on BMO's internal knowledge base. This answer is based on general LLM training). | Partial. Need to make sure we follow the suggested order. |
| BFR-1.6 | Data Source Refresh Cadence | Near real-time connection to the knowledge base for live retrieval from the intended source. | Q&A | | | 1. Establish data refresh cadence with all specified knowledge bases. <br> 2. Ensure connection to data sources are reflected in responses within a predetermined time window (e.g., daily, weekly). | Full |
| BFR-1.7 | Output format | The LLM should respond to user requests in a conversational chatbot format, unless prompted by users to output responses in specified formats. Other formats considered to be in scope include: <br> - pdf <br> - Word | Q&A | | | 1. Confirm the chatbot outputs responses in a conversational style. <br> 2. Provide functionality for users to request output in CSV, PDF, or Word formats and verify the accuracy and formatting of such outputs. | Done. Need to understand when a user needs a file generated and write code to handle file generation. |
| BFR-1.8 | Run Time | Responses should be efficiently generated in real time. | Q&A | | | 1. Validate performance under various load conditions to ensure consistent response times. | Full |
| BFR-1.9 | Conversation history limit | The system should retain all conversation history. If the conversation exceeds the max token limit, it should automatically drop the oldest messages until the token length is under the max. Input and output should both count towards the max token set by the model. | Q&A | | | 1. Ensure the system maintains conversation history during a session. <br> 2. Implement functionality to automatically manage the maximum token limit by dropping the oldest messages. <br> 3. Give the user a notification that a previous conversation is not within the context window. | Partial. Need to show a warning message when content exceeds max tokens. |

### Document Analysis Pod requirements

| Req ID | Requirement Title | Requirement Description | Location | Owner / Source | Priority | Acceptance Criteria | Implemented |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BFR-2.1 | General document analysis | Document Analysis should utilize the LLM to summarize and provide insights on the uploaded document, with a baseline response including the following: <br> - Summary generation <br> - Extraction of key points, decisions, and action items | Document Analysis | | | 1. Verify the LLM's capability to generate accurate summaries for various types of documents. <br> 2. Test the extraction of key points, decisions, and action items with sample documents. | Full |
| BFR-2.2 | Input Data Format | Accept various input files, including CSV, Word, PDF, Excel. All input formats will be converted to PDF for ingestion. | Document Analysis | | | 1. Confirm successful conversion of various input formats to PDF for processing. <br> 2. Validate ingestion capability for CSV, Word, PDF, and Excel formats. <br> 3. Ensure handling of uploads in different file formats. | Partial. Need to verify file formats that can be uploaded. |
| BFR-2.3 | Output Format | LLM should respond to users in a conversational chatbot format by default. Where prompted by users to output responses in a specified format. Other formats considered to be in scope include an editable version of: <br> - csv <br> - Word | Document Analysis | | | 1. Ensure responses are delivered in a conversational style by default. <br> 2. Validate the ability to generate results in CSV and Word formats based on user prompts. <br> 3. Validate the ability to generate formatted Word documents with sections and subsections. | Similar to BFR-1.7. None. |
| BFR-2.4 | Conversational capabilities | Users should be able to ask questions or request follow-up prompts specific to the document.
