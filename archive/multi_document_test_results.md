## Test Questions and Results

### Question 1: How many times is the word "risk" mentioned? ðŸ”„ Multi-Document

**Response:**
The word "risk" appears **99 times** in the text. This high frequency suggests that risk is a central theme or key topic in the document, appearing more frequently than other significant terms like "capital" (81 occurrences) and "credit" (51 occurrences).

**âœ… Result:** Successfully counted across both documents simultaneously

### Question 2: What does CET ratio stands for? ðŸ”„ Multi-Document

**Response:**
CET ratio stands for **Common Equity Tier 1 ratio**. It is a fundamental banking metric that measures a bank's core financial strength by comparing its core equity capital to its risk-weighted assets (RWA).

This ratio is particularly important because:
- It serves as a key regulatory measure of a bank's financial stability
- It helps assess a bank's ability to withstand financial stress
- It's part of the broader regulatory capital framework, which includes both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital

Under current banking regulations, banks must maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5% before applying the capital conservation buffer to be considered adequately capitalized.

This metric is one of the most important indicators used by regulators and investors to evaluate a bank's financial health and resilience during challenging economic conditions.

**âœ… Result:** Comprehensive definition extracted from multi-document analysis
