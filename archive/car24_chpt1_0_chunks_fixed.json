The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or \nto subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline \ntogether with the leverage requirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding \ncompany, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. \nFor this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio \ndescribed in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk-based capital ratio described in \nthis guideline.\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a \nbank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards, the \nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under \nsubsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its \ncapital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.",
