# Multi-Document Fix Test - Expected Results

## üß™ Test Setup
**Documents Created:**
- **Document A:** "Test Document A: This document discusses FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT strategies."
- **Document B:** "Test Document B: This document covers CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT procedures."

**Query:** "Compare these two documents and tell me what each one discusses"

## üîß What the Fix Should Do

### BEFORE Fix (Broken):
```
AI Response: "I notice that you haven't shared the actual documents you'd like me to compare. Without access to both documents' content..."
```

### AFTER Fix (Working):
```
AI Response: "Based on the two documents provided:

Document A discusses FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT strategies, focusing on...

Document B covers CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT procedures, detailing...

Comparison: Both documents are related to risk management in financial contexts, but Document A focuses on broader financial risk management strategies while Document B specifically addresses credit risk assessment procedures..."
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ FIXED (Should see):
1. **Content from Document A:** AI mentions "financial risk management"
2. **Content from Document B:** AI mentions "credit risk assessment"  
3. **Comparison performed:** AI compares both documents
4. **No access errors:** AI doesn't say "haven't shared documents"

### ‚ùå STILL BROKEN (Would see):
1. **No specific content:** AI doesn't mention the actual document content
2. **Access error:** AI says "I don't have access" or "please provide documents"
3. **Only one document:** AI only discusses one document

## üîÑ How the System Works Now

### Step 1: Orchestrator Planning
- AI generates plan: `search_multiple_docs(doc_names=["ACTIVE_DOCUMENTS"])`
- **FIX:** No query filter, so gets ALL content

### Step 2: Document Search  
- `search_multiple_docs` called with both document names
- Returns ALL chunks from both documents (not filtered)

### Step 3: Synthesis
- `synthesize_content` receives full content from both documents
- AI can now compare actual content instead of just metadata

## üöÄ Test Commands

```bash
# Make script executable and run
chmod +x test_multi_doc_fix.sh
./test_multi_doc_fix.sh
```

The script will automatically:
1. Create test documents with specific content
2. Upload them to the backend  
3. Send a multi-document comparison query
4. Analyze the response for success indicators
5. Give a clear verdict on whether the fix works

## üéØ Expected Outcome
**‚úÖ SUCCESS:** "MULTI-DOCUMENT FIX IS WORKING!"
