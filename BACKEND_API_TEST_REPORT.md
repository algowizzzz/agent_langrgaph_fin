3. **Speaking with a business banking specialist** at your local BMO branch

#### 3.6 General Banking Question ✅
**Endpoint**: `POST /chat`  
**Response Time**: 2,987.65ms  
**Status**: 200 OK  
**Source**: General LLM Knowledge  

**User Query**:
```
"How does compound interest work in savings accounts?"
```

**AI Response** (1,919 characters):
```
Compound interest in savings accounts is a powerful concept that helps your money grow over time. It works by earning interest not only on your original deposit (principal) but also on the interest that has already been added to your account.

**How Compound Interest Works:**

1. **Initial Deposit**: You deposit money into a savings account
2. **Interest Earned**: The bank pays you interest on your balance
3. **Interest Added**: This interest is added to your account balance
4. **Compound Effect**: Future interest calculations include both your original deposit AND the previously earned interest

**Example:**
- You deposit $1,000 at 3% annual interest, compounded monthly
- Month 1: You earn $2.50 in interest ($1,000 × 0.03 ÷ 12)
- Your new balance: $1,002.50
- Month 2: Interest calculated on $1,002.50, not just the original $1,000
- This continues, with each month's interest calculation based on the growing balance

**Key Factors:**

**Compounding Frequency:**
- Daily: Interest calculated and added daily (most common)
- Monthly: Interest calculated and added monthly
- Quarterly: Interest calculated and added every 3 months
- Annually: Interest calculated and added once per year

More frequent compounding = more growth

**Time Impact:**
The longer your money stays in the account, the more dramatic the compound effect becomes. This is why starting to save early is so powerful.

**Interest Rate:**
Higher interest rates obviously lead to more compound growth, but even small rate differences can have significant long-term impacts.

**Formula:**
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial deposit)
- r = Annual interest rate (as decimal)
- n = Number of times interest compounds per year
- t = Time in years

**Practical Tip:**
To maximize compound interest, avoid withdrawing from your savings account and consider accounts with higher interest rates and more frequent compounding.
