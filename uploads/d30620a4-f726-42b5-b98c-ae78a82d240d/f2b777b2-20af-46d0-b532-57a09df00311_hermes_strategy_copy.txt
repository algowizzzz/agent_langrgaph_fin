Project Hermes is a strategic initiative to modernize our client onboarding process.
The primary goal is to reduce onboarding time by 50% by the end of Q4.
Key stakeholders include the Sales, Compliance, and Operations departments.
The project lead is Jane Doe.
One major risk is the integration with the legacy CRM system.
The next milestone is the completion of the technical discovery phase by July 30th.
Budget allocated is $250,000.
We need a decision on the primary cloud vendor by next week.
Action item for John Smith: Schedule a vendor comparison meeting.
The desired outcome is a seamless, digital-first onboarding experience for all new clients.
