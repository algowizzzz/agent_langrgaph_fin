### Issues Identified
‚ùå **Document Content Retrieval:** Critical issue - all responses are generic LLM knowledge, not document-specific content  
‚ùå **Orchestrator-Level Document Lookup:** Search function integration failing during orchestrator execution  
‚ùå **Confidence Scoring:** All queries returned 0 confidence, indicating retrieval failures  

### Debug Information - Orchestrator Execution
```
üîç SEARCH DEBUG: doc_name='...riskandfinace.pdf', in_store=False, store_keys=7
‚ùå SEARCH DEBUG: Document '...riskandfinace.pdf' NOT FOUND in store
Error: "V2_FIXED_VERSION: Doc 'riskandfinace.pdf' not found."
```

### Debug Information - Direct Function Tests
```
‚úÖ DIRECT TEST: Document in store: True
‚úÖ VERIFIED TEST: Document exists: True
‚úÖ VERIFIED TEST: Found 1 chunks for document
‚úÖ VERIFIED SUCCESS: Returning 1 chunks
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Document EXISTS** in document_store.json with correct content about "Understanding Finance and Risk"
2. **Direct function calls WORK** - both regular and verified search functions find the document
3. **Orchestrator integration FAILS** - the search function returns "not found" during workflow execution

## ‚ö†Ô∏è LARGE DOCUMENT TEST (BMO AR2024 MDA.pdf - Multiple chunks)

### Test Query: BMO RWA Comprehensive Analysis
**Query:** "summarise RWA comprehensively in a report covering all sections for the CRO of the BMO bank using the doc only"
**Document:** bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf  
**Expected Behavior:** Large document analysis using refine synthesis strategy (>10 chunks)

**Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **TIMEOUT (30s)**
- **Issue:** Server timeout processing large document
- **Technical Cause:** Document size exceeds 30-second timeout threshold
- **Business Impact:** Large document analysis requires timeout adjustment
- **Recommendation:** Increase server timeout for comprehensive analysis workflows

### Alternative Test: Simple BMO Query  
**Query:** "what is BMO's CET1 ratio?"
**Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **TIMEOUT (30s)**
- **Analysis:** Even simple queries timeout on large documents
- **Root Cause:** Document processing overhead for large files

## Summary & Business Readiness
