- ✅ Error handling with retry logic and timeout management
- ✅ **ENHANCEMENT ADDED:** Agent Reasoning Visibility System
- ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED:** Document content analysis now works properly

#### **🔥 Sprint 3 Enhancement: Agent Reasoning Visibility**

**Feature Overview:**
Added comprehensive agent reasoning visibility system that shows users the AI's step-by-step thinking process, similar to reasoning models like Claude Sonnet with reasoning or GPT-o1.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Backend:** Added `reasoning_steps` and `thoughts` fields to DocumentAnalysisState
- **Workflow:** Each LangGraph node captures reasoning steps with timestamps and context
- **API:** ChatResponse model enhanced to include reasoning data
- **Frontend:** Expandable "Agent Thinking Process" component with step-by-step display

**User Experience:**
Users can now see:
1. **Loading Documents** - File processing status and document count
2. **Planning Analysis** - Query understanding and approach planning  
3. **Analyzing Documents** - Content processing and analysis execution
4. **Finalizing Results** - Result formatting and completion

#### **🐛 Critical Bug Fix: Document Analysis**

**Problem:** Document analysis was giving generic responses instead of analyzing actual uploaded content.

**Root Cause:** When planner JSON parsing failed, fallback prompts didn't include user's actual request context.

**Solution:** Created `_get_fallback_prompts_with_context()` method that includes user's specific query in prompts.

**Validation:** ✅ Tested with real CSV data - system now correctly analyzes actual document content and provides specific answers.

#### **📊 Technical Verification (Test Results)**

**Test Case:** "Which department has the highest revenue?" with CSV data:
```
Department,Revenue,Employees
Technology,2500000,45
Marketing,800000,12  
Operations,1200000,28
Sales,3200000,35
```

**Result:** ✅ "The department with the highest revenue is the Sales department, with a revenue of $3,200,000."

**System Architecture Verified:**
- ✅ FastAPI backend with verbose logging
- ✅ 4-node LangGraph workflow execution
- ✅ Real OpenAI API integration
- ✅ Document content processing (1 chunk, 335 characters)
- ✅ Reasoning visibility with timestamps
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
