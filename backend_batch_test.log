Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1.

In the post -approval \nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n \n \n1. 5.

To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk,\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \nFiscal year  \n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \n 31.

Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \n \n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges.

Table 2 provides the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios for institutions \nbefore application of the capital conservation buffer.   \n \n11  There are two exceptions to this rule. One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the \nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so.

Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45.

[Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \n \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of RWA .\n13 Table 4 provides the minimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conversation buffer. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.2]   \n \nTable 4: Capital conservation buffer (as % of RWA)  \nCapital conservation buffer  2.5%  \nMinimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer  \nCET1  7.0%  \nTier 1  8.5%  \nTotal  10.5%  \n 48.

Capital distribution constraints will be imposed on an institution when capital levels fall \nwithin the buffer conservation range. Institutions will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall within the buffer range as they experience losses. The constraints imposed \n \n12    Applies only to performance bonuses issued to institutions’ senior management. The term “senior management”  \nis defined in OSFI’s Corporate Governance Guideline .  \n13   For Category  III SMSBs, the capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of [Adjusted Total Assets +  \nRWA Operational Risk ]\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 14 relate only to distributions, not the operations of the institution. The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs’ Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings)  \n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \n>7.0%  0% \n 50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer  \n 53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed \nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide \nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential \nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and \nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when \n \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance.

Institutions will be subject to restrictions on distributions of earnings if they breach the extended buffer.  \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.8] \n 55. Institutions must meet the countercyclical buffer with CET1. Consistent with the capital \nconservation buffer, the CET1 ratio in this context includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% minimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additional CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and 8% Total Capital requirements as well as D -SIBs’ minimum 21.5% TLAC requirement. \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.17]  56.

In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n \n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \n 74.

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability  \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\n  \n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 24 institution. The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n Supervisory Implications  \n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \ndisclosure practices;  \n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\ndisclosure practices;  \n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\n45  \n Information Disclosure Practices  \n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions’ risk models and risk management \npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \n \n \n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \nImportant Financial Institutions .

Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \n 11.

The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \n 22.

An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \n \n \n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implemen tation Note\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \n \n \n1. 5. Capital Floor –Internal Model Based Approaches  \n \n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk,\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nInstitutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \nFiscal year  \n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \n \n32.

Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \n \n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges.

The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:  \nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 \n Where:  \nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \n 39.

One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the \nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so. Both of these \nexceptions expire when the revised CVA framework is implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2024.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 12 Table 2: Minimum capital requirements (in RWA)  \nCET1  4.5%  \nTier 1  6.0%  \nTotal  8.0%  \n \n1.6.2.

Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45.

It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \n \n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital.

The distribution constraints \nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs’ Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings)  \n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \n>7.0%  0% \n 50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \nrestricted from making positive net distributions.

Countercyclical Buffer  \n 53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed \nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide \nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential \nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and \nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\n18 will be put in place  when \n \n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance.

Domestic Stability Buffer  \n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \nCommittee (FISC) .\n33\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nCommittee (FISC) .\n33 \n \n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB’s total RWA calculated \nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \nCET1 c apital.  \n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI’s Gu ide to Intervention\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \n \n \n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \n \n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\nannual DSB level -setting announcements.

In \nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \n \n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \n \n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \nplus the conservation buffer .\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital.

D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \n  \n \n \n \n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\nons, where applicable.  \n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital.

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability  \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider.

As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\n  \n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress.

The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy.

The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n Supervisory Implications  \n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \ndisclosure practices;  \n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\ndisclosure practices;  \n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\n45  \n Information Disclosure Practices  \n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions’ risk models and risk management \npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \n \n \n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \nImportant Financial Institutions .

Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \n 11.

Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \n \n24.

To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches .

If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \n \n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \nFiscal year  \n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \n 31.

Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \n \n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges.

One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the \nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so.

The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress.

When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\n12 Institutions may also \nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45.

If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs’ Total Loss \nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \nof earnings)  \n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \n>7.0%  0% \n 50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \n \n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio .\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \nrestricted from making positive net distributions.

In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers.

Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan.

Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities.

The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \n \nSize  \n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that:\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \n \nInter -connections \n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \n \nSubstitutability  \n \n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \n \n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \n \n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  \n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \n \n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\n  \n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \n \n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \n \n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 24 institution. The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \n Supervisory Implications  \n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\n44 The Framework is applied on a\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n44 The Framework is applied on a \nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \n \n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n \n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \ndisclosure practices;  \n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;\n\n---CHUNK SEPARATOR---\n\ndisclosure practices;  \n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\n45  \n Information Disclosure Practices  \n 11.
