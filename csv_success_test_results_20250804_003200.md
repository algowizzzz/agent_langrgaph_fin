## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Orchestrator Issue**
The orchestrator calling mechanism has a bug - the direct tool works but orchestrated calls fail. This suggests:
1. Import conflict between document_tools modules
2. Context/session parameter mismatch
3. Tool registry calling wrong implementation

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps**
1. Fix orchestrator tool calling mechanism
2. Test through web interface (Streamlit)
3. Verify tool registry imports
