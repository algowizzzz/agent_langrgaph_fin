      "content": "The CET (Common Equity Tier) ratio is a key financial metric used to measure a bank's financial strength and stability. It represents the ratio of a bank's core equity capital to its risk-weighted assets.\n\nSpecifically, CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1) ratio is the most important version, which measures a bank's highest quality capital (primarily common shares and retained earnings) against its total risk-weighted assets. This ratio is a crucial indicator used by regulators to assess if banks have sufficient capital to withstand financial stress.\n\nThe formula is:\nCET Ratio = (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets) Ã— 100%\n\nBanks are required to maintain minimum CET ratios as part of Basel III international banking regulations. A higher CET ratio indicates better financial strength and ability to absorb potential losses. Generally:\n- The minimum required CET1 ratio is 4.5%\n- Most large banks aim to maintain ratios well above 10%\n- Higher ratios are viewed more favorably by regulators and investors\n\nThis is a fundamental metric in banking regulation and risk assessment.",
