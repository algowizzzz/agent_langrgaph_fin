The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in \\nthis guideline.\\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the \\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \\n \\n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \\nrequirements described in OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .   \\n\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 2 Chapter 1  - Overview of risk -based capital \\nrequirements  \\n \\nThe Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) for banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies are set out in nine chapters, each of which has been issued as a separate document.

Outlined below is an overview of the capital adequacy requirements for banks \\n(including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies , collectively referred to as ‘institutions’.  \\n 2. This chapter is drawn from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Basel \\nFramework published on the Bank for I nternational S ettlements (BIS)  website .\\n2 For reference, \\nthe Basel paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are indicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph .\\n3  \\n \\n1. 1. Scope of Application  \\n 3. The capital adequacy requirements outlined in this guideline apply on a consolidated \\nbasis to the following institutions:  \\na. all institutions designated  by OSFI as domestic systemically important banks (D -\\nSIBs); and  \\nb. small and medium- sized deposit -taking institutions (SMSBs\\n4), which fall into \\nCategories I, II or III as defined in OSFI’s SMSB Capital and Liquidity Requirements Guideline.\\n5  \\n 4. The consolidated entity includes all subsidiaries except insurance subsidiaries.\\n OSFI \\nexpects institutions to hold capital within the consolidated group in a manner that is consistent with the level and location of risk.    \\n1. 2. Regulatory Capital  \\n 5. Total capital consists of the sum of the following elements: \\ni. Tier 1 capital, consisting  of: \\na. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ; and  \\nb. Additional Tier 1 capital  \\nii. Tier 2 capital  \\n \\n \\n2    The Basel Framework   \\n3  Following the form at: [Basel Framework, XXX yy.zz]  \\n4    SMSBs are banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, \\nand federally regulated loan companies that have not been designated by OSFI as domestic systemically \\nimpo rtant banks (D -SIBs). This includes subsidiaries of SMSBs or D -SIBs that are banks (including federal \\ncredit unions) , federally regulated trust companies or federally regulated loan companies.  \\n5    SMSB Capital and Liquidity Guideline  \\n\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 5 6. The criteria for the capital elements comprising the two tiers, as well as the various \\nlimits, restrictions and regulatory adjustments to which they are subject, are de scribed in \\nChapter  2. \\n \\n1. 3. Total Risk -weighted Assets \\n \\n7. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) make up the denominator of the risk- based capital ratios, \\nand is calculated as the higher of:  \\na. the sum of the following three elements:  \\ni. RWA for credit risk;  \\nii. RWA for market risk; and  \\niii. RWA for operational risk; and \\nb. the adjusted RWA determined as per the capital floor described in section 1.5. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.4]  \\n 1.3.1. Credit Risk   8. RWA for credit risk (including counterparty credit risk) is calculated as the sum of:  \\na. Credit  RWA for banking book exposures which, except the RWA listed in (b) \\nthrough (e) below, is calculated using:   \\ni. the standar dized approach (as set out in Chapter 4); or  \\nii. the Internal Ratings -Based (IRB) approach (as set out in Chapter 5).  \\nb. RWA for counterparty credit risk from banking book exposures and trading book exposures (as set out in Chapter 7), except the exposures liste d in (c) and (f) below.  \\nc. Credit RWA for equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book calculated using one or more of the approaches set out in Chapter 4:  \\ni. The look- through approach \\nii. The mandate -based approach  \\niii. The fall -back approach  \\nd. RWA for se curitization exposures held in the banking book, calculating using one \\nor more of the approaches set out in Chapter 6:  \\ni. Securitization Standardized Approach (SEC -SA) \\nii. Securitization External  Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -ERBA)  \\niii. Securitization Internal Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -IRBA)  \\niv. Securitization Internal Assessment Approach (SEC -IAA)  \\nv.

RWA for exposures to central counterparties in the banking book and trading \\nbook, calculated using the approach set out in Chapter 7.  \\nf. RWA for the risk posed by unsettled transactions and failed trades, where the transactions are in the banking book or tra ding book and are within the scope of \\nthe rules set out in Chapter 7.  \\ng. RWA for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk for exposures in the trading and banking book, calculated as set out in Chapter 8 using either:  \\ni. The standardized approach for CVA; or  \\nii. The advanced approach for CVA.    \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.6]  \\n 9. Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \\n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \\n 11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be \\nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:  \\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;   \\n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and  \\n• own-use property, plant and equipment  \\n 12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \\nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:  \\n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and  \\n• accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \\nresult of subsequent revaluations  \\n 13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \\n \\n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \\nbooked in Canada.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 7  \\na. The standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (SA -\\nCCR), set out in section 7.1.7. \\nb. The comp rehensive approach, set out in section 4.3.3(iii) of Chapter 4.  \\nc. The value at risk (VaR) models approach, set out in section 5.4.1(iii) of Chapter 5.  \\nd. The Internal Model Method (IMM), set out in section 7.1.5. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.7]  \\n \\n14. For banks with OSFI  approval to use IMM to calculate counterparty credit risk \\nexposures, EAD for counterparty credit risk exposures must be calculated according to sections 7.1.3 through 7.1.5. [Basel Framework, RBC 20.8]  \\n \\n1.3.2. Market Risk  \\n 15. Market risk requirements, as outlined in Chapter 9, apply to internationally active \\ninstitutions and all institutions designated by OSFI as D -SIBs. OSFI retains the right to apply the \\nframework to other institutions, on a case -by-case basis, if trading activities are a large \\nproportion of overall operations. \\n \\n16. Institutions subject to market risk requirements must identify the instruments that are in \\nthe trading book following the requirements of Chapter 9. All instruments that are not in the trading book and all other a ssets of the institution (termed “banking book exposures”) must be \\ntreated under one of the credit risk approaches. [Basel Framework, RBC 20.5]  \\n 17. RWA for market risk are calculated as  RWA for market risk for instruments in the \\ntrading book and for foreign e xchange risk and commodities risk for exposures in the banking \\nbook, calculated using:  \\ni. The standardized approach, as described in section 9.5; or  \\nii. The internal models approach set out in section 9.6. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.9]  \\n 1.3.3. Operational Risk  \\n 18. All institutions are subject to operational risk requirements, as described in Chapter 3.  \\n 19. RWA for operational risk are calculated using either:  \\na. The Simplified Standardized Approach, set out in section 3.3; or  \\nb. The Standardized Approach, set out in section 3.4. \\n \\n20. D-SIBs and SMSBs that report adjusted gross income\\n7 greater than $1.5 billion must \\nuse the standardized approach. SMSBs with annual adjusted gross income less than $1.5 billion must use the simplified standardized approach, unless they have received approval from OSFI to \\nuse the standardized approach, as set out in section 3.2. \\n \\n7      Adjusted gross income is defined in section 3.3  \\n\\n\\n## Page 8\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 8  \\n1. 4. Approval to use Internal Model Based Approaches  \\n \\n21. Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \\n 22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \\nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \\nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\\n8 Institutions that do not receive \\napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23. An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \\n \\n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \\nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \\n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \\nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \\n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \\nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \\n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \\n \\n \\n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implemen tation Note  \\n\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \\nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \\nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \\nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \\nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \\n \\n \\n1. 5. Capital Floor –Internal Model Based Approaches  \\n \\n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \\ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \\ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \\nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \\nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \\n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \\ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \\ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \\nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \\n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \\n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \\ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \\n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \\n \\n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \\noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \\ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \\nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \\nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline. \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 10\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \\nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \\nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \\nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \\nFiscal year  \\n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \\nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \\n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \\n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \\ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \\n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \\n \\n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \\ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter 4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this guideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \\n \\n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \\nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \\nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. After November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \\napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.   34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \\nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline.  35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \\ncalculation of the capital floor:  \\na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \\nb. SEC-IRBA;  \\nc. the IMA for market risk;  \\nd. the VaR  models approach to counterparty credit risk; and  \\n \\n10  For institutions with a fiscal year ending October 31 or December 31, respectively.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 11 e. the IMM for counterparty credit risk.11  \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.12] \\n1.5.2. Adjusted Capital Requirement  \\n \\n36. The adjusted capital requirement is based on application of all of the chapters of this \\nguideline and is equal to the net total of the following amounts: \\ni. total risk -weighted assets, plus \\nii. 12.5 times the provisioning shortfall deduction, less \\niii. 12.5 times excess provisions included in Tier 2, less \\niv. 12.5 times the amount of general allowances that may be recognized in Tier 2 in respect of exposures for which the standardized approach is used. \\n 37. The provisioning shortfall deduction, excess provisions included in Tier 2, and general \\nallowances in Tier 2 in respect of standardized portfolios are defined in section 2.1.3.7 of Chapter 2 of this guideline.  \\n1. 6. Calculation of OSFI Minimum Capital Requirements  \\n 1.6.1. Risk -Based Capital Ratios for D-SIBs and Category I and II SMSBs  \\n 38. Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for \\nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for \\nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets \\nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:  \\nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 \\n Where:  \\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \\nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \\n 39. Table 2 provides the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios for institutions \\nbefore application of the capital conservation buffer.   \\n \\n11  There are two exceptions to this rule. One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \\ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \\nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the \\nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so. Both of these \\nexceptions expire when the revised CVA framework is implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2024.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 12\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 12 Table 2: Minimum capital requirements (in RWA)  \\nCET1  4.5%  \\nTier 1  6.0%  \\nTotal  8.0%  \\n \\n1.6.2. Simplified Risk -Based Capital Ratio for Category III SMSBs \\n 40.   Category III SMSBs are subject to a Simplified Risk -Based Capital Ratio (SRBCR), \\ncalculated as follows:  \\n \\nSRBCR  =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\\n𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴\\n𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑇𝑇\\n𝑇𝑇\\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴\\n + 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶  𝑹𝑹𝑶𝑶𝑹𝑹 𝑹𝑹 \\n Where:  \\n \\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \\n \\nAdjusted Total Assets =  Total Assets from the Balance Sheet, less the aggregate of all adjustments to regulatory capital as  \\nset out in Chapter 2.  \\n \\nRWA \\nOperational Risk =  Risk-Weighted Assets for operational risk, calculated as \\ndetailed in Chapter 3 . \\n  41. Table 3 provides the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios for Category III \\nSMSBs before application of the capital conservation buffer.  \\nTable 3: Minimum Capital Requirements (measured as SRBCR)  \\nCET1  4.5%  \\nTier 1  6.0%  \\nTotal  8.0%  \\n \\n1. 7. Mandated Capital Buffers  \\n 42. In addition to the minimum capital ratios, institutions are required to hold a capital \\nconservation buffer and, where applicable, a countercyclical buffer.    43. Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \\nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.20]  \\n\\n\\n## Page 13\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 13 44. When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\\n12 Institutions may also \\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In \\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions \\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \\n \\n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \\nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of RWA .\\n13 Table 4 provides the minimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conversation buffer. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.2]   \\n \\nTable 4: Capital conservation buffer (as % of RWA)  \\nCapital conservation buffer  2.5%  \\nMinimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer  \\nCET1  7.0%  \\nTier 1  8.5%  \\nTotal  10.5%  \\n 48. Capital distribution constraints will be imposed on an institution when capital levels fall \\nwithin the buffer conservation range. Institutions will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall within the buffer range as they experience losses. The constraints imposed \\n \\n12    Applies only to performance bonuses issued to institutions’ senior management. The term “senior management”  \\nis defined in OSFI’s Corporate Governance Guideline .  \\n13   For Category  III SMSBs, the capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of [Adjusted Total Assets +  \\nRWA Operational Risk ] \\n\\n\\n## Page 14\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 14 relate only to distributions, not the operations of the institution. The distribution constraints \\nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs’ Total Loss \\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \\nof earnings)  \\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \\n>7.0%  0% \\n 50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \\n \\n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio . \\n\\n\\n## Page 15\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \\npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \\nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \\n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \\n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \\n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \\nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \\nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \\nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer  \\n 53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \\naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed \\nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide \\nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential \\nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \\n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \\ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and \\nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\\n18 will be put in place  when \\n \\n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (“FISC”), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.  \\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides informat ion that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national \\nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 30.10]  \\n17  The Bank of Canada will be the primary source of public information on macro- financial developments and the \\nstate of vulnerabilities in Canada with regard to the countercyclical buffer, including as published in its Financial \\nSystem Review (FSR).  \\n18   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer requirement would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total \\nAssets + RWA Operational Risk ] \\n\\n\\n## Page 16\", 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'chunk_index': 0, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:07.307404', 'file_size': 554263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt1_0.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf'}, {'page_content': \"## Page 16\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 16 circumstances warrant.

To give \\ninstitutions time to adjust to a buffer level, OSFI will pre -announce its decision, to activate or \\nraise the level of the countercyclical buffer, by up to 12 months but no less than 6 months. Conversely, decisions to release the countercyclical buffer will normally take effect immediately.

In addition, institutions are not e xpected to \\nreplicate sectoral buffers or similar measures adopted by foreign jurisdictions that depart from \\nthe internationally agreed countercyclical buffer. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.9]  Institutions must \\nensure that their countercyclical buffer is calculated and publicly disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements. In addition, when disclosing their buffers, if any, institutions must also disclose the geographic breakdown of their private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer.

OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of \\nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1% \\nof RWAs.

Domestic Stability Buffer  \\n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \\nCommittee (FISC) .\\n33 \\n \\n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB’s total RWA calculated \\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \\nCET1 c apital.  \\n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI’s Gu ide to Intervention\\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \\n \\n \\n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n\\n\\n## Page 20\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \\nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \\nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \\n \\n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could \\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \\n \\n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to \\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In \\nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \\nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \\n \\n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \\n \\n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \\n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \\nplus the conservation buffer .\\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\\nons, where applicable.  \\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \\nsurcharge of 1.0%.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 21\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 21 Table 8: Target Capital Ratios  \\n \\n SMSBs  D-SIBs  \\nTarget CET1 capital  7.0%  8.0% plus DSB  \\nTarget Tier 1 capital  8.5%  9.5% plus DSB  \\nTarget Total capital  10.5%  11.5%  plus DSB  \\n \\n75. These targets are applicable to all institutions and are triggers for supervisory intervention \\nconsistent with OSFI’s Guide to Intervention.37 If an institution is offside the relevant target ratios, \\nsupervisory action will be taken proportional to the shortfall and circumstances that caused the shortfall and may include a range of actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on distribu tions.  \\n 76. The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions or \\ngroups of institutions where circumstances warrant, including in respect of idiosyncratic and/or systemic risks that are not adequately captured by institutions ’ Pillar I capital requirements and \\nbuffers. The need for Pillar II capital and corresponding higher target capital ratios would consider how robust existing capital ratios are in light of an institution’s allowances, stress testing program, and ICAAP results .\\n38  \\n \\n \\n37  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n38  For OSFI’s expectations refer to Guideline E -18: Stress Testing  and Guideline E -19: Internal Capital Adequac y \\nAssessment Process (ICAAP) . \\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 22 Annex 1   Domestic Systemic Importance and Capital Targets  \\n \\n1. The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \\n \\nSize  \\n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \\n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \\n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \\n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \\n \\nInter -connections \\n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \\ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \\n \\nSubstitutability  \\n \\n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \\n \\n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 23\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \\nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \\nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \\nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \\n \\n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \\nrange of evidence are the following:  \\n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \\n \\n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\\n  \\n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \\n \\nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \\n \\n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \\n \\n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks  \\n\\n\\n## Page 24\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 24 institution. The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \\ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \\npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \\n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \\n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \\n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \\n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \\n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \\n Supervisory Implications  \\n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\\n44 The Framework is applied on a \\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \\n \\n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \\n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \\nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \\n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 25\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \\nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \\n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \\n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \\nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \\n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \\n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \\n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \\n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \\norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \\ndisclosure practices;  \\n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \\nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \\n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \\n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \\n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \\nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\\n45  \\n Information Disclosure Practices  \\n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \\ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions’ risk models and risk management \\npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \\nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \\nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \\n \\n \\n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \\nImportant Financial Institutions .

Treatment of counterparty credit risk and cross -product netting  \\n 2. This rule identifies permissible methods for estimating the Exposure at Default (EAD) \\nor the exposure amount for instruments with counterparty credit risk under this guideline.\\n3  \\nInstitutions may seek OSFI approval to make use of an Internal Modelling Method (IMM) meeting the requirements and specifications identified herein. As an alternative institutions may also use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA- CCR).  [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 53.1] \\n7.1.1 Definitions and general terminology  \\n3. This section defines terms that will be used throughout this chapter. \\n \\n7.1.1.1 General terms  \\n \\n• Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR)  is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could \\ndefault before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss would occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default. Unlike an institution’s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending institution faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of the transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The market value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying market factors.  \\n• A central counterparty  (CCP) is a clearing house that interposes itself between \\ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance of open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants through novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the purposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.   \\n• A qualifying central counterparty  (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as  a \\nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted by the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products \\n \\n1    The Basel Framework   \\n2  Following the format: [Basel Framework XXX yy.zz].  \\n3 In this document, the terms “exposure at default” and “exposure amount” are used together in order to identify \\nmeasures of exposure under both an internal ratings -based (IRB) and a standardi zed approach for credit risk.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 5 offered. This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised \\nin a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the CPSS -IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.  \\nWhere the CCP is in a jurisdiction that does not have a CCP regulator applying the \\nPrinciples to the CCP, then OSFI may make the determination of whether the CCP meets \\nthis definition.  \\nIn addition, for a CCP to be considered as a QCCP, the requirements in paragraph 204 \\nmust be met to permit each clearing member institution to calculate its capital requirement for its default fund contributions.  \\n• A clearing member is a member of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is entitled to enter into a transaction with the CCP, regardless of whether it enters into trades with a CCP for its own hedging, investment or speculative purposes or wh ether it also enters \\ninto trades as a financial intermediary between the CCP and other market participants .\\n4  \\n• A client is a party to a transaction with a CCP through either a clearing member acting as \\na financial intermediary, or a clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the client \\nto the CCP.  \\n• Initial margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted to the CCP to mitigate the potential future exposure of the CCP to the clearing member arising from the possible future change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of the calculation of counterparty credit risk capital requirements, initial margin does not include contributions to a CCP for mutualized loss sharing arrangements (i.e., in case a CCP uses initial margin to mutualize losses among the clearing members, it will be treated as a default fund exposure). Initial margin may include excess collateral, in cases \\nwhere the CCP may prevent the clearing member and the clearing member may prevent the client from withdrawing the excess.   \\n• Variation margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted on a daily or intraday basis to a CCP based upon price movements of their transactions.  \\n• Trade exposures (in section 7.1.8) include the current\\n5 and potential future exposure of a \\nclearing member or a client to a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange traded derivatives transactions or securities financing transactions (SFTs), as well as initial margin.  \\n• Default funds , also known as clearing deposits or guaranty fund contributions (or any \\nother names), are clearing members’ funded or unfunded contributions towards, or underwriting of, a CCP’s mutualized loss sharing arrangements. The description given by \\n \\n4  For the purposes of this chapter, where a CCP has a link to a second CCP, that second CCP is to be treated as a \\nclearing member of the first CCP. Whether the second CCP’s collateral contribution t o the first CCP is treated as \\ninitial margin or a default fund contribution will depend upon the legal arrangement between the CCPs. OSFI \\nshould be consulted to determine the treatment of this initial margin and default fund contributions.    \\n5  For the pu rposes of this definition, the current exposure of a clearing member includes the variation margin due \\nto the clearing member but not yet received.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 6 a CCP to its mutualized loss sharing arrangements is not determinative of its status as a \\ndefault fund; rather, the substance of such arrangements will govern its status.  \\n• Offsetting transaction means the transaction leg between the clearing member and the CCP when the clearing member acts on behalf of a client (e.g. , when a clearing member \\nclears or novates a client’s trade). \\n \\n• A multi -level client structure is one in which institutions can centrally clear as indirect \\nclients; that is, when clearing services are provided to the institution by an institution which is not a direct clearing member, but is itself a client of a clearing member or another clearing client. For exposures between clients and clients of clients, we use the term “ higher -level client ” for the institution providing clearing services; and the term \\n“lower level client ” for the institution clearing through that client.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.6]  \\n \\n7.1.1.2 Transaction types  \\n \\n• Long Settlement Transactions are transactions where a counterparty undertakes to deliver a security, a commodity, or a foreign exchange amount against cash, other financial instruments, or commodities, or vice versa, at a settlement or delivery date that is contractually specified as more than the lower of the market standard for this particular instrument and five business days after the date on which the institution enters into the transaction.  \\n• Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) are transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and borrowing, and margin lending transactions, where the value of the transactions depends on market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements.  \\n• Margin Lending Transactions are transactions in which an institution extends credit in connection with the purchase, sale, carrying or trading of securities. Margin lending transactions do not include other loans that happen to be secured by securities collateral. Generally, in margin lending transactions, the loan amount is collaterali zed by securities \\nwhose value is greater than the amo unt of the loan. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.14]  \\n \\n7.1.1.3 Netting sets, hedging sets, and related terms  \\n \\n• Netting Set  is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \\nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is  recogni zed for \\nregulatory capital purposes under Chapter 4 or the Cross -Product Netting Rules set forth \\nin this chapter. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is recogni zed for regulatory capital purposes should be \\ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules.  \\n• Hedging Set  is a set of transactions within a single netting set within which full or partial \\noffsetting is recognized for purposes of calculating the potential future exposure (PFE) add-on of the SA -CCR. .  \\n\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 7 • Margin Agreement is  a contractual agreement or provisions to an agreement under \\nwhich one counterparty must supply collateral to a second counterparty when an \\nexposure of that second counterparty to the first counterpa rty exceeds a specified level.  \\n• Margin Threshold  is the largest amount of an exposure that remains outstanding until \\none party has the right to call for collateral.  \\n• Margin Period of Risk is the time period from the last exchange of collateral covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterpart until that counterpart is closed out and the resulting market risk is re -hedged.  \\n• Effective Maturity under the Internal Model Metho d for a netting set with maturity \\ngreater than one year is the ratio of the sum of expected exposure over the life of the transactions in a netting set discounted at the risk- free rate of return divided by the sum of \\nexpected exposure over one year in a ne tting set discounted at the risk -free rate. This \\neffective maturity may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing expected exposure with effective expected exposure for forecasting horizons under one year. The formula is given in paragraph 35.  \\n• Cross -Product Netting refers to the inclusion of transactions of different product \\ncategories within the same netting set pursuant to the Cross -Product  Netting Rules set out \\nin this chapter.  \\n• Current Market Value (CMV) refers to the net market value of the portfolio of \\ntransactions within the netting set with the counterparty. Both positive and negative market values are used in computing CMV. \\n[ Basel Fr amework, CRE 50.15]  \\n \\n7.1.1.4 Distributions  \\n \\n• Distribution of Market Values  is the forecast of the probability distribution of net \\nmarket values of transactions within a netting set for some future date (the forecasting horizon) given the reali zed market value of those transactions up to the present time.  \\n• Distribution of Exposures is the forecast of the probability distribution of market values that is generated by setting forecast instances of negative net market values equal to zero (this takes account of the fact that, when the institution owes the counterparty money, the institu tion does not have an exposure to the counterparty).  \\n• Risk -Neutral Distribution is  a distribution of market values or exposures at a future \\ntime period where the distribution is calculated using market implied values such as implied volatilities.  \\n• Actual D istribution is a distribution of market values or exposures at a future time \\nperiod where the distribution is calculated using historic or reali zed values such as \\nvolatilities calculated using past price or rate changes.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.22 to 50.25]  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 8\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 8 7.1.1.5 Exposure measures and adjustments  \\n \\n• Current Exposure is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction or portfolio \\nof transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default \\nof the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in \\nbankruptcy. Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.  \\n• Peak Exposure  is a high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution of \\nexposures at any particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction in the netting set. A peak exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.  \\n• Expected Exposure is the mean (average) of the distribution of exposures at any particular future date before the longest -maturity transaction in the netting set matures. \\nAn expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the \\nlongest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.  \\n• Effecti ve Expected Exposure at a specific date is the maximum expected exposure that \\noccurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as \\nthe greater of the expected exposur e at that date, or the effective exposure at the previous \\ndate. In effect, the Effective Expected Exposure is the Expected Exposure that is constrained to be non- decreasing over time.  \\n• Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of exp ected \\nexposures where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval. When calculating the minimum capital requirement, \\nthe average is taken over the first year or, if all the contracts in the net ting set mature \\nbefore one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract in the netting set.  \\n• Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE) is the weighted average over time of effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if al l the contracts in the \\nnetting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract \\nin the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval.  \\n• Credit Va luation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid -market valuation of the \\nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the credit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. This a djustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the \\nmarket value of the credit risk of both the institution and the counterparty.  \\n• One-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects \\nthe mar ket value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does not reflect the \\nmarket value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty.  \\n• Debit Valuation Adjustment  is a valuation adjustment that reflects the market value of \\nthe credit  risk of the institution to the counterparty (i.e. changes in the reporting \\ninstitution’s own credit risk), but does not reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution.

Banks  must calculate a counterparty credit risk charge for all exposures that give rise to \\ncounterparty credit risk, with the exception of those transactions listed in paragraphs  10 and 11 \\nbelow. The categories of transaction that give rise to counterparty credit ris k are:  \\n• OTC Derivatives;  \\n• Exchange -traded derivatives (ETDs)  \\n• Long Settlement transactions; and \\n• Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs)  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.4]  \\n 5. Such instruments generally exhibit the following abstract characteristics:  \\n• the transactions generate a current exposure or market value;  \\n• the transactions have an associated random future market value based on market variables;  \\n• the transactions generate an exchange of future payments or an exchange of a financial instrument (including commodities) against payment;  \\n• the transactions are undertaken with an identified counterparty against which a unique probability of default can be determined.\\n6 \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.5]  \\n \\n \\n6  Transactions for which the probability of default is defined on a pooled basis are not included in this t reatment of \\nCCR.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 10\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 10 6. Other common characteristics of the transactions to be covered may include the \\nfollowing:  \\n• collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in the nature of some \\ntransactions;  \\n• short -term financing may be a primary objective in that the t ransactions mostly consist of \\nan exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a relatively short period of time, usually for the business purpose of financing. The two sides of the transactions are not the result of separate decisions but form an indivisible whole to accomplish a defined objective;  \\n• netting may be used to mitigate the risk; \\n• positions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis), according to market \\nvariables . \\n• remargining may be employed. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.6]  \\n \\n7.1.3 Methods for Computing CCR Exposure  \\n7. For the transaction types listed in paragraph 4 above, banks must calculate their \\ncounterparty credit risk exposure, or exposure at default (EAD) ,\\n7 using one of the methods set \\nout in paragraphs 8 to 9 below. The methods vary according to the type of the transaction, the \\ncounterpar ty to the transaction, and whether the bank has received supervisory approval to use \\nthe method (if such approval is required). [Basel Framework, CRE 51.7]  \\n8. For exposures that are not cleared through a central counterparty (CCP) the following \\nmethods must be used to calculate the counterparty credit risk exposure:  \\n(1) The standardi zed approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (SA -CCR), \\nwhich is set out in section 7.1.7. This method is to be used for exposures arising from OTC \\nderivatives, exchange -traded derivatives and long settlement transactions. This method must be \\nused if the bank does not have approval to use the internal model method (IMM).  \\n(2) The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of collateral, which are \\nboth set out in the credit risk mitigation section  of the standardi zed approach to credit risk (see \\nChapter 4, section 4.3). These methods are t o be used for securities financing transactions (SFTs) \\nand must be used if the bank does not have approval to use the value -at-risk (VaR) models or the \\nIMM.  \\n \\n7    The terms “exposure” and “EAD” are used interchangabl y in the counterparty credit risk chapters of the credit \\nrisk standard. This reflects the fact that the amounts calculated under the counterparty credit risk rules must \\ntypically be used as either the “exposure” within the standardi zed approach to credit ri sk, or the EAD within the \\ninternal ratings -based (IRB) approach to credit risk, as described in paragraph 13 . \\n\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 11 (3) The VaR models approach, which is set out in Chapter 4, section 4.3. The VaR models \\napproach m ay be used to calculate EAD for SFTs, subject to supervisory approval, as an \\nalternative to the method set out in (2) above.  \\n(4) The IMM, which is set out in 7.1.5. This method may be used, subject to supervisory approval, as an alternative to the methods to calculate counterparty credit risk exposures set out in (1) and (2) above (for all of the exposures referenced in those bullets).  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.8]  \\n9. For exposures that are cleared through a CCP, banks must apply the method set out in \\nsection 7.1.8. This method covers:  \\n(1) the exposures of a bank to a CCP when the bank is a clearing member of the CCP;  \\n(2) the exposures of a bank to its clients, when the bank is a clearing member and acts as an intermediary between the client and the CCP; and  \\n(3) the exposures of a bank to a clearing member of a CCP, when the bank is a client of the \\nclearing member and the clearing member is acting as an intermediary between the bank and the CCP. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.8]  \\n10. Exposures arising from the settlement of cash transactions (equi ties, fixed income, spot \\nFX and spot commodities) are not subject to this treatment .\\n8 The settlement of cash transactions \\nremains subject to the treatment described in section 7.2. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.10]  \\n 11. As an exception to the requirements of paragraph 4 above, banks are not required to \\ncalculate a counterparty credit risk charge for the following types of transactions (i.e. the \\nexposure amount or EAD for counterparty credit risk for the trans action will be zero):  \\n(1) Credit derivative protection purchased by the bank against a banking book exposure, or \\nagainst a counterparty credit risk exposure. In such cases, the bank will determine its capital \\nrequirement for the hedged exposure according t o the criteria and general rules for the \\nrecognition of credit derivatives within the standardi zed approach or IRB approach to credit risk \\n(i.e. substitution approach). \\n(2) Sold credit default swaps in the banking book where they are treated in the framework as a \\nguarantee provided by the bank and subject to a credit risk charge for the full notional amount.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.16]  \\n \\n12. Under the methods outlined above, the exposure amount or EAD for a given \\ncounterparty is equal to the sum of the exposure  amounts or EADs calculated for each netting set \\n \\n8  For contributions to prepaid default funds covering settlement- risk-only products, the applicable risk weight is \\n0%.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 12\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 12 with that counterparty,9 subject to the exception outlined in paragraph 13. [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 51.11]  \\n \\n13. The exposure or EAD for a given OTC derivative counterparty is defined as the greater \\nof zero, and the difference between the following: the sum of EADs across all netting sets with \\nthe counterparty, and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for that counterparty which has \\nalready been recogni zed by the bank as an incurred write -down (i.e., a CVA loss). This CVA \\nloss is calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit valuation adjustments or \\nfunding valuation adjustments deducted from capital under Chapter 2 of this guideline. This reduction of EAD by incurred CVA losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA risk capital requirement.  [Basel Fr amework, CRE 51.13]  \\n 14. RWAs for a given OTC derivative counterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk \\nweight under the s tandardi zed or IRB approach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the \\ncounterparty. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.12]  \\n7.1.4 Approval to adopt an internal modelling method to estimate EAD  \\n15. An institution (meaning the individual legal entity or a group) that wishes to adopt an \\ninternal modelling method to measure exposure or EAD for regulatory capital purposes must seek OSFI approval. IMM is  available both for institutions that adopt the internal ratings -based \\napproach to credit risk and for institutions for which the standardi zed approach to credit risk \\napplies to all of their credit risk exposures. Only institutions subject to the market risk rules of Chapter 9 of this guideline are permitted to apply for the use of the IMM. The institution must meet all of the requirements given in s ection  7.1.5. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.1]  \\n 16. An institution may also choose to adopt an internal modelling method to measure CCR  \\nfor regulatory capital purposes for its exposures or EAD to only OTC derivatives, to only SFTs, \\nor to both, subject to the appropriate recognition of netting specified below in section 7.1.6. The institution must apply the method to all relevant exposures within that category, except for those that are immaterial in size and risk. During the initial implementation of the internal models method, an inst itution may use the SACCR for a portion of its business. The institution must \\nsubmit a plan to OSFI to bring all material exposures for that category of transactions under the IMM. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.2]  \\n 17. For all OTC derivative transactions and for al l long settlement transactions for which an \\ninstitution has not received OSFI approval to use the internal models method, the institution must use the SA -CCR. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.3]  \\n 18. Exposures or EAD arising from long settlement transactions can be de termined using \\neither of the methods identified in this guideline regardless of the methods chosen for treating OTC derivatives and SFTs. In computing capital requirements for long settlement transactions, institutions that hold permission to use the inter nal ratings -based approach may opt to apply the \\n \\n9  Where a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets and the SA -CCR is used, refer to paragraphs \\n166 to 167.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 13\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 13 risk weights under the standardi zed approach for credit risk on a permanent basis and \\nirrespective to the materiality of such positions. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.4]  \\n \\n19. After adoption of the internal model method, the institution must comply with the above \\nrequirements on a permanent basis. Only under exceptional circumstances or for immaterial \\nexposures can an institution revert to the SA -CCR for all or part of its exposure. In all cases, the \\ninstitution must ob tain approval from OSFI to do so and demonstrate that reversion to a less \\nsophisticated method does not lead to an arbitrage of the regulatory capital rules. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.5]  \\n7.1.5 Internal Model Method: measuring exposure and minimum  requirements  \\n7.1.5.1 Exposure amount or EAD under the internal model method  \\n20. CCR exposure or EAD is measured at the level of the netting set as defined in sections \\n7.1.1 and 7.1.6. A qualifying internal model for measuring counterparty credit exposure must \\nspecify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to changes in market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, etc. The model then computes the firm’s CCR exposure for the netting set at each future date given the changes in the market variables. For margined counterparties, the model may also captur e future collateral \\nmovements. Institutions may include eligible financial collateral as defined in section 4.3.3 and Chapter 9  in their forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set, if \\nthe quantitative, qualitative and data  requirements for internal model method are met for the \\ncollateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.6]  \\n 21. To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk for exposures \\nsubject to the IMM, institutions must use the greater of the portfolio- level capital charge (not \\nincluding the CVA charge in Chapter 8) based on Effective EPE using current market data and the portfolio- level capital charge based on Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress \\ncalibration should be a single consistent  stress calibration for the whole portfolio of \\ncounterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration should be applied on a total portfolio level and not on a counterparty by counterparty basis. [Basel Framework,  CRE 53.7]  \\n 22. OSFI expects institutions to have in place a policy for verifying the adequacy of, and \\nupdating, their choice of stress period. This policy would have to be approved in advance by OSFI as part of the IMM model approval process. Changes to this policy would constitute a major modification of the IMM model . \\n 23. To the extent that an institution recogni zes collateral in exposure amount or EAD via \\ncurrent exposure, an institution would not be permitted to recogni ze the benefits in its estimates \\nof LGD.  As a result, the institution would be required to use an LGD of an otherwise similar \\nuncollaterali zed facility. In other words, it would be required to use an LGD that does not \\ninclude collateral that is already included in EAD. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.8]  \\n 24. Under the IMM, the institution need not employ a single model. Although the following \\ntext describes an internal model as a simulation model, no particular form of model is required. \\n\\n\\n## Page 14\", 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 0, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199671', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 14\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 14 Analytical models are acceptable so long as they are subject to OSFI revi ew, meet all of the \\nrequirements set forth in this section and are applied to all material exposures subject to a CCR -\\nrelated capital charge as noted above, with the exception of long settlement transactions, which \\nare treated separately, and with the exception of those exposures that are immaterial in size and risk. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.9]  25. Expected exposure or peak exposure measures should be calculated based on a \\ndistribution of exposures that accounts for the possible non- normality of the distribution of \\nexposures, including the existence of leptokurtosis (“fat tails”), where appropriate. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.10]  26. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as the product of \\nalpha times Effective EPE, as specified below (except for counterparties that have been identified as having explicit specific wrong-way risk or specific right-way risk – see paragraph 65):  \\nEAD = α  × Effective EPE   (1) \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.11] \\n27. Effective EPE (“Expected Positive Exposure”) is computed by estimating expected \\nexposure ( EE\\nt) as the average exposure at future date t , where the average is taken across \\npossible future values of relevant market risk factors, such as interest rates, foreign exchange \\nrates, etc.  The internal model estimates EE as a series of future dates t 1, t2, t3…10. Specifically, \\n“Effective EE” is computed recursively, where the current date is denoted as t 0 and Effective \\nEEt0 equals current exposure: \\nEffective EEtk = max(Effective EE tk-1, EE tk)  (2) \\nwhere the current date i s denoted as t 0 and Effective EE t0 equals current exposure.   \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.12] \\n28. In this regard, “Effective EPE” is the average Effective EE during the first year of future \\nexposure. If all contracts in the netting set mature before one year, EPE is the average of expected exposure until all contracts in the netting set mature. Effective EPE is computed as a weighted average of Effective EE:  \\nmin(1 , )\\n1kyear maturity\\ntk\\nkEffective EPE EffectiveEE t\\n== ×∆ ∑  (3) \\nwhere the weights Δ tk = t k – t k-1 allows for the case when future exposure is calculated at \\ndates that are not equally spaced over time.  \\n \\n10  In theory, the expectations should be taken with respect to the actual probability distribution of future exposure \\nand not the risk- neutral one. OSFI recogni zes that practical considerations may make it more feasible to use the \\nrisk-neutral one. As a result, OSFI will not mandate which kind of forecasting distribution to employ.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 15\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 15 [Basel Framework, CRE 53.13]  \\n29. Alpha (α) is set equal to 1.4. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.14]  \\n \\n30. OSFI retains discretion to require a higher alpha based on a f irm’s CCR exposures. \\nFactors that may require a higher alpha include the low granularity of counterparties; particularly high exposures to general wrong- way risk; particularly high correlation of market values across \\ncounterparties; and other institution- specific characteristics of CCR exposures. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.15]  \\n7.1.5.2 Own estimates for alpha \\n31. Institutions may seek OSFI approval to compute internal estimates of alpha subject to a \\nfloor of 1.2, where alpha equals the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of \\ncounterparty exposure across counterparties (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE (denominator), assuming they meet certain operating requirements. Eligible institutions must meet all the operating requirements for internal estimates of EPE and must demonstrate that their internal estimates of alpha capture in the numerator the material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of market values of transactions or of portfolios of transactions across counterparties (e.g. the correlation of defaults across counterparties and between market risk and default). [Basel Framework, CRE 53.16]  \\n 32. In the denominator, EPE must be used as if it were a fixed outstanding loan amount. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.17]   33. To this end, institutions  must ensure that the numerator and denominator of alpha are \\ncomputed in a consistent fashion with respect to the modelling methodology, parameter specifications and portfolio composition. The approach used must be based on the firm’s internal economic cap ital approach, be well -documented and be subject to independent validation. In \\naddition, institutions must review their estimates on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time. Institutions must a ssess the \\nmodel risk given the significant variation in estimates of alpha can arise from the possibility for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator, especially where convexity is present . \\nThe assessment of model risk must be part of the independent model validation and approval process and model performance monitoring. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.18]   34. Where appropriate, volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint \\nsimulation of market and credit risk should be condit ioned on the credit risk factor to reflect \\npotential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn. Internal estimates of \\nalpha should take account of the granularity of exposures. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.19]  \\n7.1.5.3 Maturity  \\n35. If the original maturity of the longest -dated contract contained in the set is greater than \\none year, the formula for effective maturity (M) in Chapter 5 is replaced with the following:  \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 16\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 16  \\nwhere df k is the risk -free discount factor for future time period t k and the remaining symbols \\nare defined above. Similar to the treatment under corporate exposures, M has a cap of five \\nyears .11  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.20] \\n 36. For netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than one year, \\nthe formula for effective maturity (M) in Chapter 5 is unchanged and a floor of one year applies, \\nwith the exception of short-term exposures as described in Chapter 5 - Internal Ratings Based \\nApproach, section 5.4.1 (iv).  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.21] \\n37. For derivative contracts subject to paragraph 65 (SWWR) and st ructured such that on \\nspecified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of \\nthe contract is zero, the remaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \\n7.1.5.4 Margin agreements \\n38. If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the internal model captures the \\neffects of margining when estimating EE, the model’s EE measure may be used directly in equation (2). Such models are noticeably more complicated than models of EPE for unmargined counterparties. As such, they are subject to a higher degree of supervisory scrutiny before they are approved, as discussed below.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.22]  39. An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to capture the \\neffects of margining. It must take into account both the current amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model must account for the nature of margin agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model mus t either model the mark -to-market change in the \\nvalue of collateral posted or apply this guideline’s rules for collateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.23]  40. For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark- to-market valuation, a \\nsupervisory floor of five business days for netting sets consisting only of repo-style transactions, and 10 business days for all other netting sets is imposed on the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling EAD with margin agreements. In the following cases a higher supervisory floor is imposed: \\n \\n11  Conceptually, M equals the effective credit duration of the counterparty exposure. A bank that uses an internal model to \\ncalculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment (CVA) can use the effective credit duration estimated by such a model in \\nplace of the above formula w ith prior approval of OSIF.  ≤\\n= >\\n≤\\n=×∆ × + ×∆ ×\\n=\\n×∆ ×∑∑\\n∑1\\n11\\n1\\n1k\\nk\\nkt year maturity\\nk kk k kk\\nk t year\\nt year\\nk kk\\nkEffective EE t df EE t df\\nM\\nEffective EE t df\\n\\n\\n## Page 17\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 17 • for all netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5,000 at any point during a \\nquarter, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of risk for the following quarter;  \\n• for netting sets cont aining one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral, or an \\nOTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of risk. For these purposes, “Illiquid collateral” and “OTC derivatives that cannot be easily replaced” must be determined in the context of stressed market conditions and will be characteri zed by the absence of continuously \\nactive markets where a counterparty would, within two or fewer days, obtain multiple price quotat ions that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market \\ndiscount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC derivative). Examples of situations where trades are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, but are not l imited to, trades that are not marked daily and trades that are subject to specific \\naccounting treatment for valuation purposes (e.g., OTC derivatives or repo- style \\ntransactions referencing securities whose fair value is determined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).  \\n• in addition, an institution must consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the institution  would be able to replace its trades.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.24]  \\n 41. If an institution has experienced more than two margin call disputes on a particular \\nnetting set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the applicable margin period of risk (before consideration of this provision), then the institution must reflect this history appropriately by using a margin period of risk that is at least double the supervisory floor for that netting set for the subsequent two quarters. In the case of derivatives subject to Guideline E-22, this paragraph only applies to variation margin call disputes.  [Basel Framework, CRE \\n53.25]  \\n 42. For re -margining with a periodicity of N -days, the margin period of risk should be at \\nleast equal to the supervis ory floor, F, plus the N days minus one day. That is,  \\n Margin Period of Risk = F + N - 1. \\n \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.26]  \\n 43. Institutions using the IMM must not capture the effect of a reduction of EAD due to any \\nclause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.27]  \\n7.1.5.5 Model validation \\n44. In order to assure itself that institutions using models have counterparty credit risk \\nmanagement systems that are conceptually soun d and implemented with integrity, OSFI will \\nspecify a number of qualitative criteria that institutions would have to meet before they are \\n\\n\\n## Page 18\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 18 permitted to use a models -based approach. The extent to which institutions meet the qualitative \\ncriteria may influence the level at which OSFI will set the multiplication factor referred to in \\nparagraph 29 (Alpha). Only those institutions in full compliance with th e qualitative criteria will \\nbe eligible for application of the minimum multiplication factor. The qualitative criteria include:  \\n• the institution must conduct a regular programme of backtesting, i.e., an ex -post \\ncomparison of the risk measures12 generated by the model against reali zed risk \\nmeasures, as well as comparing hypothetical changes based on static positions with realized measures;  \\n• the institution must carry out an initial validation and an ongoing periodic review of its IMM model and the risk measures generated by it. The validation and review must be independent of the model developers;  \\n• senior management should be actively involved in the risk control process and must \\nregard credit and counterparty credit risk control as an essential aspect of the business \\nto which significant resources need to be devoted. In this regard, the daily reports \\nprepared by the independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient  seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of \\npositions taken by individual traders and reductions in the institution’s overall risk exposure;  \\n• the institution’s internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely integrated \\ninto the day- to-day risk management process of the institution. Its output should \\naccordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling \\nits counterparty credit risk profile;  \\n• the risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with inte rnal trading and \\nexposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits should be related to the institution’s risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit function and senior management;  \\n• institutions should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented \\nset of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation of the risk measurement system.

Backtesting must consider a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various start (initializ ation) dates and covering a wide range of market conditions;  \\n• institutions must backtest the performance of their EPE model and the model’s relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions that support EPE. For collaterali zed trades, the prediction time horizons considered must include those \\nreflecting typical margin periods of risk applied in collaterali zed/margined trading, and \\nmust include long time horizons of at least one  year;  \\n• the pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for a given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as part of the ini tial and \\nongoing model validation process. These pricing models may be different from those used to calculate Market Risk over a short horizon. Pricing models for options must account for the non- linearity of option value with respect to market risk factor s; \\n• an EPE model must capture transaction specific information in order to aggregate \\nexposures at the level of the netting set. Institutions must verify that transactions are \\nassigned to the appropriate netting set within the model;  \\n• static, historical backtesting on representative counterparty portfolios must be a part of the validation process. At regular intervals, an institution must conduct such backtesting on a number of representative counterparty portfolios. The representative portfolios must be chose n based on their sensitivity to the material risk factors and \\ncorrelations to which the institution is exposed. In addition, IMM institutions need to conduct backtesting that is designed to test the key assumptions of the EPE model and \\nthe relevant risk me asures, e.g. the modelled relationship between tenors of the same \\nrisk factor, and the modelled relationships between risk factors;  \\n• significant differences between reali zed exposures and the forecast distribution could \\nindicate a problem with the model or the underlying data that OSFI would require the institution to correct.

The backtesting programme must be capable of identifying poor performance in an EPE model’s risk measures;  \\n• institutions must validate their EPE models and all relevant risk measures out to time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure is calculated using an internal modelling method;  \\n• the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure must be regularly tested against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the ongoing model validation process;  \\n• the ongoing validation of an institution’s EPE model and the relevant risk measures \\ninclude an assessment of recent performance;  \\n\\n\\n## Page 21\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 21 • the frequency with which the parameters of an EPE model are updated needs to be \\nassessed as part of the validation process;  \\n• unde r the IMM, a measure that is more conservative than the metric used to calculate \\nregulatory EAD for every counterparty, may be used in place of alpha times Effective EPE with prior approval from OSFI. The degree of relative conservatism will be assessed up on initial OSFI approval and at the regular supervisory reviews of the EPE \\nmodels. The institution must validate the conservatism regularly; \\n• the ongoing assessment of model performance needs to cover all counterparties for which the models are used;  \\n• the va lidation of IMM models must assess whether or not the institution level and \\nnetting set exposure calculations of EPE are appropriate.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.33]  \\n \\n50.

In order to be eligible to adopt an internal model for estimating EPE arising from CCR \\nfor regulatory capital purposes, an institution must meet the following operational requirements. \\nThese include meeting the requirements related to the qualifying standards on CCR Management, a use test, stress testing, identification of wrong- way risk, and internal controls. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.34]  \\n Qualifying standards on CCR Management  \\n 52. The institution must satisfy its supe rvisor that, in addition to meeting the operational \\nrequirements identified in paragraphs 53 to 82 below, it adheres to sound practices for CCR management.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.35]  \\n Use test  \\n 53. The distribution of exposures generated by the internal model used to calculate effective \\nEPE must be closely integrated into the day- to-day CCR management process of the institution. \\nFor example, the institution could use the peak exposure from the distri butions for counterparty \\ncredit limits or expected positive exposure for its internal allocation of capital. The internal model’s output must accordingly play an essential role in the credit approval, counterparty credit risk management, internal capital a llocations, and corporate governance of institutions that seek \\napproval to apply such models for capital adequacy purposes. Models and estimates designed and implemented exclusively to qualify for the internal models method are not acceptable. [ Basel \\nFrame work, CRE 53.36]  \\n  \\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 22 54. An institution must have a credible track record in the use of internal models that \\ngenerate a distribution of exposures to CCR. Thus, the institution must demonstrate that it has \\nbeen using an internal model to calculate the distributio ns of exposures upon which the EPE \\ncalculation is based that meets broadly the minimum requirements for at least one year prior to approval. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.37]  \\n \\n55. Institutions employing the internal model method must have an independent control uni t \\nthat is responsible for the design and implementation of the firm’s CCR management system, \\nincluding the initial and ongoing validation of the internal model. This unit must control input data integrity and produce and analyz e reports on the output of the firm’s risk measurement \\nmodel, including an evaluation of the relationship between measures of risk exposure and credit and trading limits. This unit must be independent from business credit and trading units; it must be adequately staffed; it must repor t directly to senior management of the firm. The work of this \\nunit should be closely integrated into the day -to-day credit risk management process of the firm. \\nIts output should accordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling the firm’s credit and overall risk profile. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.38]  \\n 56. Institutions applying the IMM must have a collateral management unit that is \\nresponsible for calculating and making margin calls, managing margin call disputes and reporting levels of independent amounts, initial margins and variation margins accurately on a daily basis. This unit must control the integrity of the data used to make margin calls, and ensure that it is consistent and reconciled regularly with all relevant sourc es of data within the \\ninstitution. This unit must also track the extent of reuse of collateral (both cash and non- cash) \\nand the rights that the institution gives away to its respective counterparties for the collateral that it posts. These internal reports  must indicate the categories of collateral assets that are reused, \\nand the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit quality and maturity. The unit must also track concentration to individual collateral asset classes accepted by the institutions. S enior \\nmanagement must allocate sufficient resources to this unit for its systems to have an appropriate level of operational performance, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of outgoing calls and response time to incoming calls. Senior management must ensure that this unit is adequately staffed to process calls and disputes in a timely manner even under severe market crisis, and to enable the institution to limit its number of large disputes caused by trade volumes. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.39]  \\n 57. The institution’s collateral management unit must produce and maintain appropriate \\ncollateral management information that is reported on a regular basis to senior management. Such internal reporting should include information on the type of collateral (bot h cash and non-\\ncash) received and posted, as well as the size, aging and cause for margin call disputes. This internal reporting should also reflect trends in these figures. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.40]  \\n 58. An institution employing the IMM must ensure that its cash management policies \\naccount simultaneously for the liquidity risks of potential incoming margin calls in the context of exchanges of variation margin or other margin types, such as initial or independent margin, under adverse market shocks, potentia l incoming calls for the return of excess collateral posted \\nby counterparties, and calls resulting from a potential downgrade of its own public rating. The \\n\\n\\n## Page 23\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 23 institution must ensure that the nature and horizon of collateral reuse is consistent with its \\nliquidity needs and does not jeopardi ze its ability to post or return collateral in a timely manner.   \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.41]  \\n 59. The internal model used to generate the distribution of exposures must be part of a \\ncounterparty risk management framework that includes the identification, measurement, \\nmanagement, approval and internal reporting of counterparty risk.\\n13 This framework must \\ninclude the measurement of usage of credit lines (aggregating counterparty exposures with other \\ncredit exposure s) and economic capital allocation. In addition to EPE (a measure of future \\nexposure), an institution must measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the institution must measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held. The use test  is \\nsatisfied if an institution uses other counterparty risk measures, such as peak exposure or \\npotential future exposure (PFE), based on the distribution of exposures generated by the same \\nmodel to compute EPE. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.42]  \\n 60. An institution  is not required to estimate or report EE daily, but to meet the use test it \\nmust have the systems capability to estimate EE daily, if necessary, unless it demonstrates to OSFI that its exposures to CCR warrant some less frequent calculation. It must choos e a time \\nprofile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future cash flows and maturity of the contracts. For example, an institution may compute EE on a daily basis for the first 10 days, once a week out to one month, once a  month out to 18 months, once a quarter out \\nto five years and beyond five years in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposure. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.43]  \\n 61. Exposure must be measured out to the life of all contracts in the netting set (not just to \\nthe one -year horizon), monitored and controlled. The institution must have procedures in place to \\nidentify and control the risks for counterparties where exposure rises beyond the one -year \\nhorizon. Moreover, the forecasted inc rease in exposure must be an input into the firm’s internal \\neconomic capital model.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.44]  \\n Stress testing  \\n 62. An institution must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the \\nassessment of capital adequacy. These stress m easures must be compared against the measure of \\nEPE and considered by the institution as part of its internal capital adequacy assessment process. Stress testing must also involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on a firm’s credit exposures and assessment of the firm’s ability to withstand such changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are; (i) economic or industry downturns, (ii) market -place events, or (iii) decreased liquid ity conditions. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.45]  \\n 63. Institutions must have a comprehensive stress testing program for counterparty credit \\nrisk. The stress testing program must include the following elements:  \\n \\n13  This section draws heavily on the Counterparty Risk Manageme nt Policy Group’s paper, Improving Counterparty Risk \\nManagement Practices  (June 1999)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 24\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 24 • institutions must ensure complete trade capture and exposure aggregation across all \\nforms of counterparty credit risk (not just OTC derivatives) at the counterparty- specific \\nlevel in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing; \\n• for all counterparties, institutions should produce, at least monthly, exposure stress testing of principal market risk factors (e.g. interest rates, FX, equities, credit spreads, and commodity prices) in order to proactively identify, and when necessary, reduce outsized concentrations to specific directional sensiti vities;  \\n• institutions should apply multi -factor stress testing scenarios and assess material non -\\ndirectional risks (i.e. , yield curve exposure, basis risks, etc.) at least quarterly. Multiple -\\nfactor stress tests should, at a minimum, aim to address scenario s in which a) severe \\neconomic or market events have occurred; b) broad market liquidity has decreased significantly; and c) the market impact of liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary. These stress tests may be part of institution -wide str ess testing;  \\n• stressed market movements have an impact not only on counterparty exposures, but \\nalso on the credit quality of counterparties. At least quarterly, institutions should \\nconduct stress testing applying stressed conditions to the joint movement of  exposures \\nand counterparty creditworthiness;  \\n• exposure stress testing (including single factor, multifactor and material non- directional \\nrisks) and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness should be performed at the counterparty- specific, counterparty group (e.g. industry and region), and aggregate \\ninstitution -wide CCR levels;  \\n• stress tests results should be integrated into regular reporting to senior management. The analysis should capture the largest counterparty- level impacts across the portfolio,  \\nmaterial concentrations within segments of the portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends;  \\n• the severity of factor shocks should be consistent with the purpose of the stress test. When evaluating  solvency under stress, factor shocks should be severe enough to \\ncapture historical extreme market environments and/or extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The impact of such shocks on capital resources should be evaluated, as well as the impa ct on capital requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day- to-\\nday portfolio monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations, institutions should also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability;  \\n• institutions should consider reve rse stress tests to identify extreme, but plausible, \\nscenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes;  \\n• senior management must take a lead role in the integration of stress testing into the risk management framework and risk culture of the instit ution and ensure that the results \\nare meaningful and proactively used to manage counterparty credit risk. At a minimum, the results of stress testing for significant exposures should be compared to guidelines that express the institution’s risk appetite an d elevated for discussion and action when \\nexcessive or concentrated risks are present.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.46]  \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 25\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 25 Wrong- way risk  \\n \\n64. Institutions must identify exposures that give rise to a greater degree of general wrong -\\nway risk. Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify risk factors that are positively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness. Such testi ng needs to address the \\npossibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed. \\nInstitutions should monitor general wrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by \\nother categories that are germane to the busin ess. Reports should be provided to senior \\nmanagement on a regular basis that communicate wrong way risks and the steps that are being taken to manage that risk.  [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.47]  \\n 65. An institution is exposed to “specific wrong- way risk” (SWWR) if  future exposure to a \\nspecific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. For example, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong -way exposures for the \\nbuyer that is specific to the counterparty. An institution must have procedures in place to identify, monitor and control cases of SWWR, beginning at the inception of a trade and continuing through the life of the trade. To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single -name credit de fault swaps \\nwhere there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals the full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the underlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the underlying instrument allows the institution to recogni ze, in respect of such swap, the market \\nvalue that has been lost a lready and any expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for Advanced or \\nFoundation IRB institutions must be set to 100% for such swap transactions .\\n14 For institutions \\nusing the s tandardi zed approach for credit risk, the risk weight to use is that of an unsecured \\ntransaction. For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. referencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying company, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD equals the value of the transaction under the assumption of a jump- to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this \\nmakes re- use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC)  that already contain an \\nLGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%. LGD for Advanced and Foundation IRB banks will be that of an unsecured exposure. For institutions using the s tandardized a pproach for credit \\nrisk, the risk weight of an unsecured transac tion should be used.  \\n \\nThe counterparty credit risk arising from trades where SWWR has been identified can be \\nmitigated through either prepayment or the collection of independent collateral amounts. If a counterparty prepays the notional amount of the expos ure for a trade where SWWR has been \\n \\n14  Note that the recoveries may also be possible on the underlying instrument beneath such swap. The capital \\nrequirements for such underlying exposure are to be calculated without reduction for the swap which introduces \\nwrong way risk. Generally this means that such underlying exposure will receive the risk weight and capital \\ntreatment associated with an unsecured transaction (i.e. assuming such underlying exposure is an unsecured \\ncredit exposure).  \\n\\n\\n## Page 26', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 1, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199740', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 26\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 26 identified, or a portion of it, then the EAD for that trade may be reduced by the amount of the \\nprepayment.  \\n In situations where independent collateral amounts have been collected, the EAD for those trades may be reduced  by the independent collateral amount (after any applicable haircuts) provided \\none of the following situations applies:  \\n• The independent collateral amount is legally pledged to cover risk solely on the trade for which SWWR has been identified; or  \\n• Both count erparties to the trade where SWWR has been identified agree that the \\nindependent collateral amount is posted to account for the SWWR trade and this independent amount is managed internally as such. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.48]  \\n Right -Way Risk  \\n 66. An institution is exposed to “specific right -way risk” (SRWR) if the future exposure to a \\nspecific counterparty is highly inversely correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. An example of SRWR are warrants, which can be a component of  call spread \\noverlay trades written  by the counterparty on the counterparty’s stock.   \\n67. There are transactions where SRWR is present and, given the structure of these, \\ninstitutions will have a zero EAD to the counterparty if the counterparty defaults.   \\n68. Where an institution has identified SRWR, only the trade types identified in paragraph \\n69 below, and subject to due diligence ,\\n15 are permitted to receive a zero EAD. Institutions \\nwishing to add other trade types should contact OSFI’s Ca pital Division for prior permission.  \\n69. Permitted trade types include: \\n• An equity warrant , or option in each case written by the counterparty on the \\ncounterparty’s own stock  purchased as part of a call spread overlay transaction, where \\na bond hedge has also be en purchased. Call spread overlay transactions involve a \\ncounterparty issuing convertible bonds and wishing to synthetically increase the \\nconversion price.  \\n• Issuer forward as well as issuer r ange forward sales of equity whereby the institution \\nhas also simu ltaneously shorted the shares of the counterparty. Issuer and issuer range \\nforward sales of equity are typically done by a counterparty, with future capital expenditures or other funding needs, wishing to lock in a favourable current stock price or range of stock prices  without needing to issue shares until the maturity of the \\nforward or range forward transaction.  \\n• Accelerated share repurchase agreements whereby counterparties provide an \\ninstitution with funds to buy back shares in a defined peri od of time (typically under \\nsix months). \\n \\n15 Trade types listed in paragraph 69 do not automatically qualify for a zero EAD.

Other operational requirements focus on the internal controls needed to ensure the \\nintegrity of model inputs; specifically, the requirements address the transaction data, historical \\nmarket data, frequency of calculation, and valuation models used in measuring EPE. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.49]  \\n \\n71. The internal model must reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, \\ncomplete, and conservative fashion. Such terms include, but a re not limited to, contract notional \\namounts, maturity, reference assets, collateral thresholds, margining arrangements, netting arrangements, etc. The terms and specifications must reside in a secure database that is subject to formal and periodic audit. The process for recogni zing netting arrangements must require signoff \\nby legal staff to verify the legal enforceability of netting and be input into the database by an independent unit. The transmission of transaction terms and specifications data to the i nternal \\nmodel must also be subject to internal audit and formal reconciliation processes must be in place between the internal model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least conservatively. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.50]  \\n 72. When  the Effective EPE model is calibrated using historic market data, the institution \\nmust employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least three years of historical d ata must be used to estimate parameters of the model. Alternatively, market implied \\ndata may be used to estimate parameters of the model. In all cases, the data must be updated quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. To calculate the Eff ective EPE using a \\nstress calibration, the institution must also calibrate Effective EPE using three years of data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of an institution’s counterparties or calibrate Effective EPE using market implied data from a suitable period of stress. The following process will be used to assess the adequacy of the stress calibration:  \\n• The institution must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period coincides with a period of increased CDS or other credit spreads – such as loan or corporate bond spreads \\n– for a representative selection of the institution’s counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the institution does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, the institution should map each counterparty to specific credit spread data based on region, internal rating and business types. \\n• The exposure model for all counterparties must use data, either historic or implied, that includes the data from the stressed credit period, and must use such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration of the Effective EPE model to current data.  \\n [Basel Framework, CRE 53.52]  \\n 73. When two different calibration methods are used for different parameters within the \\nEffective EPE model, OSFI expects institutions’ model development and validation groups to provide documented justification for the choice of calibration methods that includes an assessment of the resulting model risk.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 28\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 28  \\n74. If an institution wished to recogni ze in its EAD calculations for OTC derivatives the \\neffect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, then it must model collateral jointly with the exposure. If the institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure then it must use either haircuts that meet the standards of the financial collateral \\ncomprehensive method with own haircut estimates or the standard supervisory haircuts. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.52]  \\n \\n75. If the internal model includes the effect of collateral on changes in the market value of \\nthe netting set, the institution must model collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself jointly wi th the exposure in its EAD calculations for securities -financing \\ntransactions. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.53]  \\n 76. The EPE model (and modifications made to it) must be subject to an internal model \\nvalidation process. The process must be clearly articulated in fi rms’ policies and procedures. The \\nvalidation process must specify the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which assumptions are violated and may result in an understatement of EPE. The validation process must incl ude a review of the comprehensiveness of the EPE model, for \\nexample such as whether the EPE model covers all products that have a material contribution to counterparty risk exposures.

The use of an internal model to estimate E PE, and hence the exposure amount or EAD, \\nof positions subject to a CCR capital charge will be conditional upon the explicit OSFI approval.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.55]  \\n \\n78. The BCBS has issued guidance regarding the use of internal models to estimate certain \\nparameters of risk and determine minimum capital charges against those risks. OSFI requires that institutions seeking to make use of internal models to estimate EPE meet similar requirements regarding, for example, the integrity of the risk managem ent system, the skills of staff that will \\nrely on such measures in operational areas and in control functions, the accuracy of models, and the rigour of internal controls over relevant internal processes. As an example, institutions seeking to make use of an internal model to estimate EPE must demonstrate that they meet the \\nCommittee’s general criteria for institutions seeking to make use of internal models to assess market risk exposures, but in the context of assessing counterparty credit risk.\\n16 [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.56]  \\n 79.

For capital adequacy purposes, institutions may net transactions (e.g., when determining \\nthe RC component of a netting set) subject to novation under which any obligation between an institution and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for th e same currency and value date, legally substituting \\none single amount for the previous gross obligations.

There are two formulations of replacement cost de pending on whether the trades with a \\ncounterparty are subject to a margin agreement. Where a margin agreement exists, the formulation could apply both to bilateral transactions and central clearing relationships. The formulation also addresses the various arrangements that an institution may have to post and/or receive collateral that may be referred to as initial margin. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.9]  \\n A. Formulation for unmargined transactions  \\n 105. For unmargined transactions (that is, where VM is not exchanged, but collateral other \\nthan VM may be present), RC is defined as the greater of: (i) the current market value of the derivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by the institution (if any ), and (ii) zero. This is \\nconsistent with the use of replacement cost as the measure of current exposure, meaning that when the institution owes the counterparty money it has no exposure to the counterparty if it can instantly replace its trades and sell c ollateral at current market prices. Mathematically:   \\n RC = max{ V-C,0} \\nwhere V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set and C is the haircut value of net collateral held, which is calculated in accordance with the NICA methodology defined in paragraph 112. For this purpose , the value of non- cash collateral posted by the institution to its \\ncounterparty is increased and the value of the non- cash collateral received by the institution from \\nits counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same as those that apply to repo -style \\ntransactions) for the time periods described in paragraph 100.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.10 and 52.11]  \\n 106. In the above formulation, it is assumed that the replacement cost representing today’s \\nexposure to the counterparty cannot go less than zero. However, institutions sometimes hold excess collateral (even in the absence of a margin agreement) or have out -of-the-money trades \\nwhich can further protect the institution from the increase of the exposure. As discussed in paragraphs 116 to 118, the SA -CCR would allow such over -collaterali zation and negative mark-\\n \\n22  Thus, if any of these supervisors is dissatisfied about enforceability under its laws, the netting contract or \\nagreement will not meet this condition and neither counterparty could obtain supervisory benefit.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 34\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 34 to market value to reduce PFE, but would not affect replacement cost .

Bilateral transactions with a one -way margining agreement in favour of the institution’s \\ncounterparty (that is, where an institution posts, but does not collect, collateral) must be treated \\nas unmargined transactions. [ Basel Framewor k, CRE 52.10, FAQ #1]  \\n \\nB. Formulation for margined transactions  \\n 108. The RC formula for margined transactions builds on the RC formula for unmargined \\ntransactions. It also employs concepts used in standard margining agreements, as discussed more fully below. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.13]  \\n 109. The RC for margined transactions in the SA -CCR is defined as the greatest exposure \\nthat would not trigger a call for VM, taking into account the mechanics of collateral exchanges in margining agreements. Such mechanics include, for example, “Threshold”, “Minimum Transfer Amount” and “Independent Amount” in the standard industry documentation,\\n23 which are \\nfactored into a call for VM .24 [Basel Framework, CRE 52.14]  \\n C. Incorporating NICA into replacement cost  \\n 110. One objective of the SA -CCR is to more fully reflect the effect of margining agreements \\nand the associated exchange of collateral in the calculation of CCR exposures. The following paragraphs address how the exchange of collateral is incorporated into the SA -CCR. [ Basel \\nFramew ork, CRE 52.15]  \\n 111. To avoid confusion surrounding the use of terms initial margin and independent amount \\nwhich are used in various contexts and sometimes interchangeably, the term independent collateral amount (ICA) is introduced. ICA represents (i) collater al (other than VM) posted by \\nthe counterparty that the institution may seize upon default of the counterparty, the amount of which does not change in response to the value of the transactions it secures and/or (ii) the Independent Amount  (IA) parameter as defined in standard industry documentation. ICA can \\nchange in response to factors such as the value of the collateral or a change in the number of transactions in the netting set. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.16]  \\n 112. Because both an institution and its counterpar ty may be required to post ICA, it is \\nnecessary to introduce a companion term, net independent collateral amount ( NICA ), to describe \\nthe amount of collateral that an institution may use to offset its exposure on the default of the \\n \\n23  For example, the 1992 (Multicurrency- Cross Border) Master Agreement and the 2002 Master Agreement \\npublished by the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc.

NICA does not include collateral that an institution has posted to a segregated, \\nbankruptcy remote account, which presumably would be returned upon the bankruptcy of the counterparty. That is, NICA represents any collateral (segregated or unsegregated) posted by the counterparty less the unsegregated collateral posted by the institution. With respect to IA, NICA takes into account the differential of IA required for the institution minus IA required for the \\ncounterparty. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.17]  \\n \\n113. For margined trad es, the replacement cost is:  \\nRC = max{ V – C; TH + MTA – NICA;0}  \\nWhere: V and C are defined as in the unmargined formulation, except that C now includes the \\nnet variation margin amount, where the amount received by the institution is accounted with a posit ive sign and the amount posted by the institution is accounted with a negative sign, TH is \\nthe positive threshold before the counterparty must send the institution collateral, and MTA is \\nthe minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty. [ Basel Fr amework, CRE 52.18]  \\n 114. TH + MTA – NICA represents the largest exposure that would not trigger a VM call and \\nit contains levels of collateral that need always to be maintained. For example, without initial margin or IA, the greatest exposure that would not trigger a variation margin call is the threshold plus any minimum transfer amount. In the adapted formulation, NICA is subtracted from TH + MTA . This makes the calculation more accurate by fully reflecting both the actual level of \\nexposure that would not trigger a margin call and the effect of collateral held and/or posted by an \\ninstitution. The calculation is floored at zero, recogni zing that the institution may hold NICA in \\nexcess of TH + MTA , which could otherwise result in a negative replacement cost. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 52.19]  \\n7.1.7.2 PFE Add -ons \\n115. The PFE add -on consists of (i) an aggregate add- on component, which consists of add-\\nons calculated for each asset class and (ii) a multiplier that allows for the recognition of excess collateral or negative mark -to-market value for the transactions . Mathematically:  \\nPFE = multiplier ×  AddOn\\naggregate \\n \\nWhere AddOnaggregate is the aggregate add -on component and multiplier is defined as a \\nfunction of three inputs: V, C and AddOnaggregate. \\n The paragraphs below describe the inputs that enter into the calculation of the add- on formulas in \\nmore detail, and set out the formula fo r each asset class.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.20]  \\n \\n7.1.7.3 Recognition of excess collateral and negative mark -to-market  \\n116. As a general principle, over -collaterali zation should reduce capital requirements for \\ncounterparty credit risk. In fact, many institutions hold excess collateral (i.e. , collateral greater \\nthan the net market value of the derivatives contracts) precisely to offset potential increases in \\n\\n\\n## Page 36\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 36 exposure represented by the add- on. As discussed in paragraphs 105 and 113, collateral may \\nreduce the replacement cost component of th e exposure under the SA -CCR. The PFE component \\nalso reflects the risk -reducing property of excess collateral. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.21]  \\n117. For prudential reasons and in line with Basel Committee direction, OSFI applied a \\nmultiplier to the PFE component tha t decreases as excess collateral increases, without reaching \\nzero (the multiplier is floored at 5% of the PFE add -on). When the collateral held is less than the \\nnet market value of the derivative contracts (“under -collaterali zation”), the current replacement \\ncost is positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the full \\nvalue of the aggregate add -on). Where the collateral held is greater than the net market value of \\nthe derivative contracts (“over -collaterali zation”), the current replacement cost is zero and the \\nmultiplier is less than one (i.e. the PFE component is less than the full value of the aggregate add-on). [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.22]  \\n118. This multiplier will also be activated when the current value of the derivative \\ntransactions is negative. This is because out -of-the-money transactions do not currently represent \\nan exposure and have less chance to go in- the-money.

The designation of a derivative transaction to an asset class is be made on the basis of \\nits primary risk driver. Most derivative transaction s have one primary risk driver, defined by its \\nreference underlying instrument (e.g., an interest rate curve for an interest rate swap, a reference entity for a credit default swap, a foreign exchange rate for a FX call option, etc). When this \\nprimary risk  driver is clearly identifiable, the transaction will fall into one of the asset classes \\ndescribed above.

For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g., multi- asset or \\nhybrid derivatives), institutions m ust take sensitivities and volatility of the underlying into \\naccount for determining the primary risk driver.   \\nOSFI may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one asset class, \\nresulting in the same position being included in multiple  classes. In this case, for each asset class \\nto which the position is allocated, institutions must determine appropriately the sign and delta \\nadjustment of the relevant risk driver.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.27 and 52.28]  \\n \\n7.1.7.6 General steps for calculating the add- on \\n \\n122. For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and \\nattributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity or commodity. The add- on for each asset class is calculated usin g asset -class -specific formulas \\nthat represent a styli zed Effective EPE calculation under the assumption that all trades in the \\nasset class have zero current mark -to-market value (i.e. they are at -the-money). [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 52.29]  \\n123. Although the add -on formulas are asset class -specific, they have a number of features in \\ncommon. To determine the add- on, transactions in each asset class are subject to adjustment in \\nthe following general steps:  \\n1) The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each individual trade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the sensitivity of the trade to movements in the underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, exchange rates, credit spreads, e quity prices and commodity prices). The effective notional is calculated as the \\nproduct of the following parameters (i.e. D = d ×  MF ×  δ): \\na. The adjustment notional (d) . The adjusted notional is a measure of the size of \\nthe trade. For derivatives in the fore ign exchange asset class this is simply the \\nnotional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative contracted, converted to the domestic currency. For derivatives in the equity and commodity asset classes, it is simply the current price of the releva nt share or unit of commodity \\nmultiplied by the number of shares/units that the derivative references. For derivatives in the interest rate and credit asset classes, the notional amount is adjusted by a measure of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that the value of the instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to movements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads).  \\nb. The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes account of the  time period over which the potential future exposure is calculated. The \\ncalculation of the maturity factor varies depending on whether the netting set is margined or unmargined.  \\nc. The supervisory delta (δ). The supervisory delta ensures the effective notional takes into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, by having a positive or negative sign. It is also takes into account whether the \\n\\n\\n## Page 38', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 2, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199758', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 38\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 38 trade has a non -linear relationship with the underlying risk factor (which is the \\ncase for options and collateralized debt obligation tranches).  \\n2) A supervisory factor (SF)  is identified for each individual trade in the netting set.

The purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where long and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the potential future exposure. \\n4) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory \\nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset -class level to give \\nthe asset class level add -on.

If a derivative contract has another derivative \\ncontract as its underlying (for example, a swaption) and may be physically exercised into the underlying contract (i.e., an institution would assume a position in the underlying contract in the event of exercise), then maturity of the contract is the time period until the final settlement date of the underlying derivative contract.  \\n• For interest rate and credit derivatives,  S\\ni is the period of time (starting today) until the \\nstart of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract. If the derivative references the value of another interest rate or credit instrument (e.g., swaption or bond option), the time period must be determined on the basis of the underlying instrument. S\\ni \\nappears in the definition of supervisory duration defined in paragraph 126.  \\n• For interest rate and credit derivatives, E i is the period of time (starting today) until the \\nend of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract. If the derivative references the value of another interest rate or credit instrument (e .g., swaption or bond \\noption), the time period must be determined on the basis of the underlying instrument. \\nEi \\nappears in the definition of supervisory duration defined in paragraph 126.

In many cases the trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity.

The aver age \\nshould be calculated as “time weighted”. The averaging described in this paragraph does \\nnot cover transactions where the notional varies due to price changes (typically FX, \\nequity and commodity derivatives).  \\n• Leveraged swaps must be converted to the not ional of the equivalent unleveraged swap, \\nthat is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated notional must be multiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is multiplied by the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the \\nremaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \\n \\n26  There is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining maturity of the \\nderivative contract.

The absolute value of the digital option effective notional must be capped by the \\nratio of the digital payoff to the relevant supervisory factor. \\n• If a trade’s payoff can be represented as a combination of European option payoffs (e.g. collar, butterfly/calendar spread, straddle, strangle, etc.), each European option component must be treated as a separate trade.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.42] \\n \\n• \\nFor the purposes of effective notional calculations, multi -payment options must be represented \\nas a combination of single-payment options.

The entity level add- ons are allowed to offset each other fully in the \\nsystemic component, whereas, there is no offsetting benefit in the idiosyncratic component. \\nThese tw o components are weighted by a correlation factor which determines the degree of \\noffsetting/hedging benefit within the credit derivative asset class. The higher the correlation factor, the higher the importance of the systemic component, hence the higher t he degree of \\noffsetting benefits. [Basel Framework, CRE 52.62]  \\n 153. It should be noted that a higher or lower correlation does not necessarily mean a higher \\nor lower capital charge. For portfolios consisting of long and short credit positions, a high correlation factor would reduce the charge. For portfolios consisting exclusively of long positions (or short positions), a higher correlation factor would increase the charge. If most of the risk consists of systematic risk, then individual reference enti ties would be highly correlated and \\nlong and short positions should offset each other. If, however, most of the risk is idiosyncratic to a reference entity, then individual long and short positions would not be effective hedges for each other. [ Basel Frame work, CRE 52.63]  \\n154.

If multiple margin agreements apply to a single netting set, (for example: one Credit \\nSupport Annex [CSA] for VM and one for Initial Margin [IM]), all collateral collected against the netting set in question can be used to offset exposures as if it were collected in a single netting set, provided the institution has performed sufficient legal review to ensure the requirements of paragraph 103 are satisfied.  \\nWhen multiple CSAs apply to an individual netting set, the RC and PFE are calculated as follows:  \\nRC \\n• The V and C terms should consider all transactions within a netting set, across all CSAs; and \\n• The TH + MTA - NICA is the sum of the thresholds and MTAs across all CSA \\nagreement.  \\n \\nPFE \\n• In the multiplier term, similarly to RC, the V and C terms should consider all transactions  \\nin the netting set across all CSA agreements; and  \\n• The margin period of risk applied to calculate effective notionals is specific to the individual CSA to which a trade belongs. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.74] \\n\\n\\n## Page 55\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 55  \\n166. If a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets, special treatment is \\nnecessary because it is problematic to allocate the common collateral to individual netting sets. The replacement cost at any given time is determined by the sum of two terms. The first term is equal to the unmargined current exposure of the institution to the counterparty aggregated across \\nall netting sets within the margin agreement reduced by the positive current net collateral (i.e. \\ncollateral is subtracted only when the institution is a net holder of collatera l). The second term is \\nnon-zero only when the institution is a net poster of collateral: it is equal to the current net posted \\ncollateral (if there is any) reduced by the unmargined current exposure of the counterparty to the \\ninstitution aggregated across all netting sets within the margin agreement.

Where a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets as described in \\nparagraph 166, collateral will be exchanged based on mark -to-market values that are netted \\nacross all transactions covered under the margin agreement, irrespective of netting sets. That is, collateral exch anged on a net basis may not be sufficient to cover PFE.  \\nIn this situation, therefore, the PFE add -on must be calculated according to the unmargined \\nmethodology.

The exposure amount for such trade exposur e is to be calculated in accordance with this \\nchapter using the IMM or the SACCR, as consistently applied by such an institution to such an exposure in the ordinary course of its business, or Chapter 4 for collaterali zed transactions. In \\napplying these methods:  \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 58\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 58 (1)The 20- day floor for the margin period of risk (MPOR) as established in the first bullet point \\nof paragraph 40 (IMM)  and 142 (SACCR) dealing with the number of transactions will not \\napply, provided that the netting set does not contain illiquid collateral or exotic  trades and \\nprovided there are no disputed trades. This refers to exposure calculations under the IMM and \\nthe SACCR as well as for the holding periods entering the exposure calculation of repo- style \\ntransactions in Chapter  4.  \\n(2) In all cases, a minimum M POR of 10 days must be used for the calculation of trade \\nexposures to CCPs for OTC derivatives.  \\n(3) Where CCPs retain variation margin against certain trades (e.g. , where CCPs collect and hold \\nvariation margin against positions in exchange -traded or OTC f orwards), and the member \\ncollateral is not protected against the insolvency of the CCP, the minimum time risk horizon applied to institutions’ trade exposures on those trades must be the lesser of one year and the remaining maturity of the transaction, with a floor of 10 business days.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.8]  \\n 177. The methods for calculating counterparty credit risk exposures , when applied to \\nbilateral trading exposures (i.e., non- CCP counterparties), require banks to calculate exposures \\nfor each individual netting set. However, netting arrangements for CCPs are not as standardized as those for OTC netting agreements in the context of bilateral trading. As a consequence, paragr aph 178 below makes certain adjustments to the methods for calculating counterparty \\ncredit risk exposure to permit netting under certain conditions for exposures to CCPs. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.9]  \\n \\n178. Where settlement is legally enforceable on a net basis in an event of default and \\nregardless of whether the counterparty is insolvent or bankrupt, the total replacement cost of all contracts relevant to the trade exposure determination can be calculated as a net replacement cost if the applicable close- out netting sets meet the requirements set out in:  \\n• Paragraphs 2 52 and, where applicable, also 253 of Chapter  4 in the case of repo -style \\ntrans actions,  \\n• Paragraph 103 of this Chapter in the case of derivative transactions, and  \\n• Paragraphs 83 to 92 of this Chapter in the case of cro ss-product netting.  \\nTo the extent that the rules referenced above include the term “master agreement” or the phrase “a netting contract with a counterparty or other agreement”, this terminology must be read as including any enforceable arrangement that pr ovides legally enforceable rights of set -off.\\n41 If the \\ninstitution cannot demonstrate that netting agreements meet these requirements, each single transaction will be regarded as a netting set of its own for the calculation of trade exposure.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.10 and 54.11]  \\n \\n \\n41  This is to take account of the fact that netting arrangements for CCPs are not  as standardized as those for OTC \\nnetting agreements in the context of bilateral trading; however, netting is generally provided for in CCP rules.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 59\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 59 (ii)  Clearing member exposures to clients  \\n \\n179. The clearing member will always capitalize its exposure (including potential CVA risk \\nexposure) to clients as bilateral trades, irrespective of whether the clearing member guarant ees \\nthe trade or acts as an intermediary between the client and the CCP. However, to recogni ze the \\nshorter close -out period for cleared client transactions, clearing members can capitali ze the \\nexposure to their clients applying a margin period of risk of a t least five days in IMM or SA -\\nCCR.42 [Basel Framework, CRE 54.12]  \\n180. If a clearing member collects collateral from a client for client cleared trades and this \\ncollateral is passed on to the CCP, the clearing member may recogni ze this collateral for both the \\nCCP -clearing member leg and the clearing member -client leg of the client cleared trade. \\nTherefore, initial margin posted by clients to their clearing member mitigates the exposure the clearing member has against these clients. The same treatment applie s, in an analogous fashion, \\nto multi- level client structures (between a higher level client and a lower level client). [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 54.13]  \\n (iii) Client exposures  \\n 181. Subject to the two conditions set out in paragraph 182 below  being met, the treatment \\nset out in paragraphs 175  to 178 above (i.e. the treatment of clearing member exposures to CCPs) \\nalso applies to the following:  \\n(1) An institution’s exposure to a clearing member where:  \\na. The institution is a client of the clearing member; and  \\nb. The transactions arise as a result of the clearing member active as a financial intermediary (i.e. , the clearing member completes an offsetting transaction with a  \\nCCP).  \\n(2) An institution’s exposure to a CCP resulting from a transactions with the CCP where:  \\na. The institution is a client of a clearing member; and  \\nb. The clearing member guarantees the performance of the institution’s exposure to the CCP.  \\n(3) Exposures of lower -level clients to higher -level clients in a multi- level client structure, \\nprovided that for all clients levels in -between the two conditions in paragraph 182 bel ow \\nare met.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.14]  \\n \\n42  The reduced EAD should also be used for the calculation of both the Advanced and Standardized CVA capita l \\ncharge.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 60\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 60 182. The two conditions referenced in paragraph 181 above are:  \\n(1) The offsetting transactions are identified by the CCP as client transactions and collateral \\nto support them is held by the CCP and/or the clearing member, as applicable, under arrangements that prevent any losses to the client due to: (a) the default or insolvency of the clearing member;  (b) the default or insolvency of the clearing member’s other clients; \\nand (c) the joint default or insolvency of the clearing member and any of its other clients. Regarding the condition set out in this paragraph:  \\na. Upon the insolvency of the clearing member, there must be no legal impediment (other than the need to obtain a court order to which the client is entitled) to the transfer of the collateral belonging to clients of a defaulting clearing member to the CCP, t o one or more other surviving clearing members or to the client or the \\nclient’s nominee.  \\nb. The client must have conducted a sufficient legal review (and undertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability) and have a well founded basis to conclude that, in the event of legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find that such arrangements mentioned above would be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the relevant laws of the relevant jurisdictio n(s). \\n(2) Relevant laws, regulation, rules, contractual, or administrative arrangements provide that the offsetting transactions with the defaulted or insolvent clearing member are highly likely to continue to be indirectly transacted through the CCP, or by the CCP, if the clearing member defaults or becomes insolvent. In such circumstances, the client \\npositions and collateral with the CCP will be transferred at market value unless the client requests to close out the position at market value. Regarding the condition set out in this paragraph, if there is a clear precedent for transactions being ported at a CCP and industry intent for this practice to continue, then these factors must be considered when assessing if trades are highly likely to be ported. The fac t that CCP documentation does \\nnot prohibit client trades from being ported is not sufficient to say they are highly likely to be ported.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.15]  \\n 183. Where a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member and \\nanother client of the clearing member jointly default or become jointly insolvent, but all other \\nconditions in the preceding paragraph are met, a risk weight of 4% will apply to the client’s exposure to the clearing member, or to the higher level client, respe ctively. [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 53.16]  \\n184. Where the institution is a client of the clearing member and the requirements in \\nparagraphs 181 to  183 are not met, the institution will capitalize its exposure (including potential \\nCVA risk exposure) to the clearing member as a bilateral trade.  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.17]  \\n\\n\\n## Page 61\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 61 (iv) Treatment of posted collateral  \\n \\n185. In all cases, any assets or collateral posted must, from the perspective of the institution  \\nposting such collateral, receive the risk weights that otherwise applies to such assets or collateral under the capital adequacy framework, regardless of the fact that such assets have been posted as \\ncollateral .\\n43 That is, collateral posted must receive the banking book or trading book treatment it \\nwould receive if it had not been posted to the CCP. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.18]  \\n186. In addition to the requirements in paragraph 185 above, the posted assets or collateral \\nare subject to counterparty credit risk requirements, regardless of whether they are in the banking \\nor trading book. This includes the increase in t he counterparty credit risk exposure due to the \\napplication of haircuts. The counterparty credit risk requirements arise where assets or collateral \\nof a clearing member or client are posted with a CCP or a clearing member and are not held in a \\nbankruptcy r emote manner. In such cases, the institution posting such assets or collateral must \\nalso recognize the credit risk based upon the assets or collateral being exposed to risk of loss \\nbased on the creditworthiness of the entity holding such assets or collater al, as described further \\nbelow. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.19]  \\n187. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trade exposures and the entity \\nholding the collateral is the CCP, the following risk weights apply where the assets or collateral is not hel d on a bankruptcy- remote basis:  \\n(1) For institutions that are clearing members a risk -weight of 2% applies. \\n(2) For institutions that are clients of clearing members: \\na) A 2% risk weight applies if the conditions in paragraph 181 and 182 are met; or  \\nb) A 4% risk weight applied if the conditions in paragraph 183 are met  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.20]  \\n188. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trades exposures, there is no \\ncapital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposures if the col lateral is: (a) held by a \\ncustodian;\\n44 and (b) bankruptcy remote from the CCP. Regarding this paragraph, all forms of \\ncollateral are included, such as: cash, securities, other pledged assets, and excess initial or variation margin, also called overcollater alization, that is held by a custodian, and is bankruptcy \\nremote from the CCP, is not subject to a capital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposure \\n \\n43  Collateral posted must receive the banking book or trading book treatment it would receive if it had not been \\nposted to the CCP. In addition, this collateral is subject to the CCR framework of the Basel rules, regardless of \\nwhether it is in th e banking or trading book. This includes the increase due to haircuts under either the \\nstandardized supervisory haircuts or the own estimates.   \\n44  In this paragraph, the word “custodian” may include a trustee, agent, pledgee, secured creditor or any other  \\nperson that holds property in a way that does not give such person a beneficial interest in such property and will not result in such property being subject to legally -enforceable claims by such persons creditors, or to a court -\\nordered stay of the return of such property, if such person becomes insolvent or bankrupt.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 62\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 62 to such bankruptcy remote custodian (i.e. the related risk weight or EAD is equal to zero). [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 54.21]  \\n189. The relevant risk weight of the CCP will apply to assets or collateral posted by a bank \\nthat do not meet the definition of trade exposures (for example, treating the exposure as a financial institution under the s tandardized a pproach or i nternal r atings -based a pproach to credit \\nrisk).  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.22]  \\n190. Regarding the calculation of the exposure, or EAD, where banks use the SA -CCR to \\ncalculate exposures, collateral posted which is not held in a bankruptcy remote manner must be accounted for in the net independent collateral amount term in accordance with paragraph 110 to 114. For banks using IM M models, the alpha multiplier must be applied to the exposure on \\nposted collateral. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.23]  \\n B. Default fund exposures  \\n 191. Where a default fund is shared between products or types of business with settlement \\nrisk only (e.g., equities and bonds) and products or types of business which give rise to counterparty credit risk (i.e., OTC derivatives, exchange -traded derivatives, SFTs or long \\nsettlement transactions), all of the default fund contributions will receive the risk weigh t \\ndetermined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below, without apportioning to different classes or types of business or products. However, where the default fund contributions from clearing members are segregated by product types and only accessible for specific product types, the capital requirements for those default fund exposures determined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below must be calculated for each specific product giving rise to counterparty credit risk. In case the CCP’s prefunded own resources are shared among \\nproduct types, the CCP will have to allocate those funds to each of the calculations, in proportion to the respective product specific EAD.  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.24]  \\n192. Whenever an institution is required to capitalize for exposures arising from default fund \\ncontributions to a QCCP, clearing member institutions will apply the following approach. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.25]  \\n193. Clearing member institutions will apply a risk weight to their default fund con tributions \\ndetermined according to a risk sensitive formula that considers (i) the size and quality of a qualifying CCP’s financial resources, (ii) the counterparty credit risk exposures of such CCP, and (iii) the application of such financial resources vi a the CCP’s loss bearing waterfall, in the \\ncase of one or more clearing member defaults. The clearing member institution’s risk sensitive \\ncapital requirement for its default fund contribution ( 𝐾𝐾\\n𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖) must be calculated using the \\nformulae and methodology set forth below. This calculation may be performed by a CCP, \\ninstitution, supervisor or other body with access to the required data, as long as the conditions in paragraphs 204 to 206 are met.  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.26]  \\n194. The clearing member bank’s risk- sensitive capital requirement for its defaul t fund \\ncontribution (K\\nCMi) is calculated in two steps:  \\n\\n\\n## Page 63\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 63 1) Calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP due to its counterparty credit \\nrisk exposures to all of its clearing members and their clients.  \\n2) Calculate the capital requirement for the clearing member institution.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.27]  \\nHypothetical Capital Requirement of the CCP  \\n195. The first step in calculating the clearing member institution’s capital requirement for its \\ndefault fund contribution is to calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP (K\\nCCP) due to its count erparty credit risk exposures to all of its clearing members and their \\nclients. K CCP is a hypothetical capital requirement for a CCP, calculated on a consistent basis \\nfor the sole purpose of determining the capitalization of clearing member default fund contributions; it does not represent the actual capital requirements for a CCP which may be \\ndetermine by a CCP and its supervisor. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.28]  \\n196. K\\nCCP is calculated using the following formula  \\n𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃=�𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖×𝑀𝑀𝑅𝑅 ×𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚  𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝐹𝐹\\n𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 \\nwhere  \\n(1) RW is a risk weight of 20%45 \\n(2) Capital ratio means 8%  \\n(3) CM is the clearing member  \\n(4) EAD i is the exposure amount of the CCP to CM ‘i’, including both the CM’s own \\ntransactions and client transactions guaranteed by the CM, and all values of collateral held by the CCP (including the CM’s prefunded default fund contribution) against these transactions, relating to the valuation at the end of the regulatory reporting date before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged.  \\n(5) The sum is over all clearing member accounts.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.29]  \\n197. Where clearing members provide client clearing services, and client transactions and \\ncollateral are held in separate (individual or omnibus) sub- accounts to the clearing member’s \\nproprietary business, each such client sub- account should enter the sum in pa ragraph 196 \\n \\n45  The 20% risk weight is a minimum requirement. As with other parts of the capital adequacy framework, OSFI \\nmay increase the risk weight. An increase in such risk weight would be appropriate if, for example, the clearing \\nmembers in a CCP are not highly rated. Any such increase in risk weight is to be communicated by the affected \\ninstitutions to the person completing this calculation.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 64', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 4, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199783', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 64\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 64 separately, i.e. the member EAD in the formula above is then the sum of the client sub-\\naccount EADs and any house sub-account EAD. This wi ll ensure that client collateral cannot \\nbe used to offset the CCP’s exposures to clearing members’ proprietary activity in the calculation of K\\nCCP. If any of these sub-accounts contains both derivatives and SFTs, the \\nEAD of that sub-account is the sum of t he derivative EAD and the SFT EAD. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 54.30] \\n198. In the case that collateral is held against an account containing both SFTs and \\nderivatives, the prefunded initial margin provided by the member or client must be allocated to the SFT and derivatives exposures in proportion to the respective product specific EADs, calculated according to Chapter 4 for SFTs and the SACCR in this chapter (without including the effects of collateral) for derivatives. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.31]\\n \\n199. If the default fund contributions of the member (DF i) are not split with regard to client \\nand house sub-accounts, they must be allocated per sub-account according to the respective fraction the initial margin of that sub -account has in relation to the total initial margin p osted \\nby or for the account of the clearing member. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.32] \\n200. For derivatives, EAD\\ni is calculated as the bilateral trade exposure the CCP has against \\nthe clearing member using the SACCR .46 47 In applying the SACCR:  \\n1) A MPOR of 10 days must be used to calculate the CCP’s potential future exposure to its clearing members on derivatives transactions (the 20 day floor on the MPOR for netting sets with more than 5,000 trades does not apply).  \\n2) All collateral held by a CCP to which that CCP has  a legal claim in the event of the \\ndefault of the member or client, including default fund contributions of that member (DF\\ni), is used to offset the CCP’s exposure to that member or client, through inclusion in \\nthe PFE multiplier in accordance with paragra phs 117 to 118 of this Chapter.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.33] \\n201. For SFTs, EAD is equal to max(EBRM i – IM i – DF i; 0), where  \\n1) EBRM i denotes the exposure value to clearing member ‘i’ before risk mitigation under \\nChapter 4; where, for the purposes of this calculation, variation margin that has been \\nexchanged (before the margin called on the final margin call of that day) enters into the mark -to-market value of the transactions;  \\n2) IM\\ni is the initial margin collateral posted by the clearing member with the CCP;  \\n \\n46  A MPOR of 10 days must be used to calculate the CCP’s potential future exposure to its clearing members on \\nderivatives transactions  \\n47  For exposures to QCCPs located in jurisdictions where the SA -CCR has not been implemented the EAD may be \\ncomputed using the current exposure method as described Capital requirements for bank exposures to central \\ncounterparties . \\n\\n\\n## Page 65\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 65 3) DF i is the prefunded default fund contribution by the clearing member that will be \\napplied upon such clearing member’s default, either along with or immediately following \\nsuch member’s initial margin, to reduce the CCP loss.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.34]  \\n202. As regards the calculation in this first step (i.e. paragraphs 195 to 201):  \\n(1) Any haircuts to be applied for SFTs must be the standard supervisory haircuts in Chapter 4.  \\n(2) The holding periods for SFT calculations in Chapter 4 and those.  \\n(3) The netting sets that are applicable to regulated clearing members are the same as those referred to in paragraph 177. For all other clearing members, they need to follow the netting rules as laid out by the CCP based upon notification of each of its clearing members. OSFI  can demand more granular netting se ts than laid out by the CCP.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.35]  \\nCapital Requirement for Each Clearing Member  \\n203. The second step in calculatingthe clearing member institution’s capital requirement for \\nits default fund contributions (K\\nCMi) is to apply the following formula:  \\n𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖=𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚�𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃×�𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜\\n𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃+𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜�;8% ×2% ×𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜� \\nwhere  \\n• 𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖is the capital requirements on the default contribution of member i;  \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜is the total prefunded default fund contributions from clearing members ; \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃 is the CCP’s pr efunded own resources ( e.g. contributed capital, retained \\nearnings, etc ), which are contributed to the default waterfall, where these are \\njunior or pari pass u to prefunded member  contributions ; and   \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜is the prefunded default fund contributions provided by clearing member i .  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.36]  \\n204. The CCP, institution, OSFI or other body with access to the required data, must make a \\ncalculation of K CCP, 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜, and DF CCP in such a way to permit the supervisor of the CCP to \\noversee those calculations, and it must share sufficient information of the calculation results to permit each clearing member to calculate their capital requirement for the default fund and for \\nthe supervisor of such clearing member to review and confirm such calculations.

KCCP must be calculated on a quarterly basis at a minimum; although national \\nsupervisors may require more frequent calculations in case of material changes (such as the CCP \\nclearing a new product). The CCP, institution, supervisor or other body that did the calculations \\nmust make available to the home supervisor of any clearing member sufficient aggregate information about the composition of the CCP’s exposures to clearing members and information \\nprovided to the clearing member for the purposes of the calculation of K\\nCCP, 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜, and DF CCP. \\nSuch information must be provided no less frequently than OSF I would require for monitoring \\nthe risk of the clearing member that it supervises.

The capital requirement for failed trades and non -DvP transactions outlined in this \\nChapter applies in addition to (i.e., it does not replace) the requirements for the transactions themselves under this framework.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 67\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 67 7.2.1 Overarching principles  \\n211.

Transactions settled through a delivery- versus -payment system (DvP) ,48 providing \\nsimultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose firms to a risk of loss on the difference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the transaction valued at \\ncurrent market price (i.e. , positive current exposure). Transactions where cash is paid without \\nreceipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, foreign currencies, gold, or commodities) or, \\nconversely, deliverables were delivered without receipt of the corresponding cash payment (non -\\nDvP, or free -delivery) expose firms to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or \\ndeliverables delivered. The current rules set out specific capital charges that address these two \\nkinds of exposures.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.3 and 70.4]  \\n 213. The following capital treatment is applicable to all transactions on securities, foreign \\nexchange instruments, and commodities that give rise to a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. \\nThis includes transactions through recogni zed clearing houses and central counterparties that are \\nsubject to daily mark -to-market and payment of daily variation margins and that involve a \\nmismatched trade .\\n49 The treatment does not apply to the instruments that are subject to the \\ncounterparty credit risk requirements set out in section 7.1 or the credit risk mitigation section of \\nchapter 4 of this guideline (i.e. over -the-counter derivatives, exchange -traded derivatives, long \\nsettlement transactions, securities financing transa ctions).[ Basel Framework, CRE 70.5]  \\n 214. In cases of a system wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central \\ncounterparty, a national supervisor may use its discretion to waive capital charges until the situation is rectified. [BCBS June 2006 Annex 3 par 4] and [Basel Framework, CRE 70.7]  \\n 215. Failure of a counterparty to settle a trade in itself will not be deemed a default for \\npurposes of credit risk under this guideline.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.8]  \\n 216. In applying a risk weight to failed free -delivery exposures, institutions using the IRB \\napproach for credit risk may assign PDs to counterparties for which they have no other banking book exposure on the basis of the counterparty’s external rating. Institutions using the Advanced IRB approach may use a 45 % LGD in lieu of estimating LGDs so long as they apply it to all \\nfailed trade exposures. Alternatively, institutions using the IRB approach may opt to apply the standardi zed approach risk weights or a 100% risk weight.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.10]  \\n \\n48  For the purpose of this guideline, DvP transactions include payment -versus -payment (PvP) transactions.  \\n49  An expos ure value of zero for counterparty credit risk can be attributed to payment transactions (e.g. funds \\ntransfer transactions) and other spot transactions that are outstanding with a central counterparty (e.g. a clearing \\nhouse), when the central counterparty CCR exposures with all participants in its arrangements are fully \\ncollateraliz ed on a daily basis.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 68\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 68 7.2.2 Capital  requirements  \\n217. For DvP  transactions, if the payments have not yet taken place five business days after \\nthe settlement date, firms must calculate a capital charge by multiplying the positive current \\nexposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor, according to the Table 3. \\n \\n \\nTable 3  \\nNumber of working days after the \\nagreed settlement date  Corresponding risk multiplier  \\nFrom 5 to 15  8% \\nFrom 16 to 30  50% \\nFrom 31 to 45  75% \\n46 or more  100%  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 70.9]  \\n \\n218. For non- DvP transactions (i.e. , free deliveries), after the first contractual \\npayment/delivery leg, the institution that has made the payment will treat its exposure as a loan if the second leg has not been received by the end of the business day.\\n50 This means that an \\ninstitution under the IRB approach will apply the appropriate IRB formula set out in this guideline, for the exposure to the counterparty, in the same way as it does for all other banking \\nbook exposures. Similarly, institutions under the standardi zed approach will use the s tandardi zed \\nrisk weights set forth in this guideline. However, when exposures are not material, institutions \\nmay choose to apply a uniform 100% risk- weight to these exposures, in order to avoid the \\nburden of a full credit assessment. If five business days after the second contractual payment/delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the institution that has \\nmade the first payment leg will deduct from capital the full amount of the value transferred plus \\nreplacement cost, if any. This  treatment will apply until the second payment/delivery leg is \\neffectively made.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.4]  \\n \\n \\n50  If the dates when two payment legs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is \\nmade, it is deemed that they are settled on the same day.

It encompasses activities such as budgeting, saving, investing, borrowing, and\\nforecasting to ensure the eﬃcient allocation of resources. Finance is broadly categorized\\ninto three areas: personal ﬁnance (managing individual or household ﬁnances), corporate\\nﬁnance (managing business ﬁnances), and public ﬁnance (managing government revenues\\nand expenditures). The primary goal of ﬁnance is to maximize value while balancing liq-\\nuidity and proﬁtability.\\nWhat is Risk?\\nRisk refers to the uncertainty or potential for loss in ﬁnancial decisions or investments.\\nIt arises from factors such as market volatility, economic changes, or unforeseen events.\\nIn ﬁnance, risk is often measured by the likelihood and magnitude of deviations from\\nexpected outcomes. Common types of ﬁnancial risk include market risk (price ﬂuctua-\\ntions), credit risk (default on loans), liquidity risk (inability to convert assets to cash),\\nand operational risk (failures in processes or systems).\\nThe Relationship Between Finance and Risk\\nFinance and risk are inherently linked, as ﬁnancial decisions involve weighing potential\\nreturns against uncertainties. Eﬀective ﬁnancial management requires assessing and mit-\\nigating risks through strategies like diversiﬁcation, hedging, or insurance. Understanding\\nrisk enables individuals and organizations to make informed decisions, optimize returns,\\nand safeguard their ﬁnancial stability.\\nFor more information, explore resources at Investopedia or consult a ﬁnancial advisor.\\n1', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_9eaada37-d793-4331-9f62-5ea15b61a1be_20250801_215126_40e96e22-a0e5-41e0-a232-5f2478768aad_riskandfinace.pdf', 'chunk_index': 0, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.210295', 'file_size': 11037, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_9eaada37-d793-4331-9f62-5ea15b61a1be_20250801_215126_40e96e22-a0e5-41e0-a232-5f2478768aad_riskandfinace.pdf', 'display_name': 'riskandfinace.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_9eaada37-d793-4331-9f62-5ea15b61a1be_20250801_215126_40e96e22-a0e5-41e0-a232-5f2478768aad_riskandfinace.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 1\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Enhanced Disclosure Task Force\\nThe Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) was established by the Financial Stability Board to provide guidance and recommendations for best\\npractice risk disclosures for banks.

We believe that the non-GAAP measures and ratios presented here, read together with our GAAP results, provide readerswith a better understanding of how management assesses results and are a reflection of ongoing business performance.\\nAdjusted results and measures in this section, including earnings per share (EPS), EPS growth, return on equity (ROE), return on tangible common\\nequity (ROTCE), net income, revenue, non-interest expense, efficiency ratio and operating leverage, are non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, an d\\nare discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nInformation regarding the composition of each of these measures is provided in the Glossary of Financial Terms.\\nFinancial Objectives\\nBMO has established medium-term financial objectives for certain important performance measures, which are set out below. Medium-term isgenerally defined as three to five years, and performance is assessed on an adjusted basis. These objectives serve as guideposts and assume anormal business environment and credit cycle. We aim to deliver top-tier total shareholder return and achieve our financial objectives by aligning o ur\\noperations with, and executing on, our strategic priorities.\\nOur business planning process is rigorous, sets ambitious goals and considers factors such as the prevailing economic environment, our risk\\nappetite, customers’ evolving needs and opportunities available across our operating groups. It includes clear and direct accountability for annu al\\nperformance that is measured against both internal and external benchmarks and progress toward our strategic priorities. We seek a balancebetween current profitability and investing to create sustainable growth. Our ability to achieve these objectives may be affected by changes in theeconomic, business or regulatory environment or extraordinary developments.\\nBMO’s results in fiscal 2024 were impacted by higher provisions for credit losses, in part due to a prolonged period of high interest rates, which\\nalso contributed to a more challenging U.S. banking market. Higher credit provisions more than offset our strong expense management. As a result,BMO did not achieve several of its medium-term financial objectives on an adjusted basis. Although an ROE of 15% will be challenging to meet in thenear term, in an environment where credit losses decline from elevated levels, we believe it to be an appropriate medium-term financial objective aswe execute our strategic plan to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our business. BMO has delivered positive operating leverage in four of th e\\nlast five years.

However, the federal government’s intent tosignificantly reduce immigration and the expected rate of population growth over the next two years implies some downside risk to GDP growth. Theunemployment rate increased by almost one percentage point during the past year to 6.5% in October 2024, due to a rapidly expanding labour forceand slowing employment growth. The unemployment rate is anticipated to rise to 7.0% by early 2025, before falling modestly as economic growthimproves and population growth slows. Easing labour shortages and lower gasoline prices contributed to the moderate 2.0% year-over-year growthin the consumer price index in October 2024. With inflation declining faster than anticipated, the Bank of Canada has lowered its key policy rate by acumulative 125 basis points since June 2024 and is expected to reduce it by an additional 125 basis points to 2.5% by June 2025. The housing marketis projected to strengthen in 2025 as a result of lower mortgage rates and new mortgage rules intended to support first-time home buyers. Industry-wide growth in residential mortgage balances remained stable at 3.5% year-over-year in September 2024, but is projected to gradually pick up ashousing market activity improves in 2025. Year-over-year growth in consumer credit (excluding mortgages) increased to 4.0% in September 2024,amid strong growth in credit card balances, though this is unlikely to be sustained in 2025. Growth in non-financial corporate credit balancesdecelerated sharply in 2024 as a result of weak business investment and elevated cash balances, but is expected to increase at a moderate pacein 2025 in response to lower interest rates. The Canadian dollar will likely remain weak due to the lower interest rate environment in Canada relativeto the United States and the threat of higher tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States, before appreciating modestly in 2025 as the U.S. dollarweakens on an easing Federal Reserve policy.\\nU.S. real GDP growth is estimated to have moderated slightly to an annual rate of 2.7% in 2024 from 2.9% in 2023, amid continued strength in\\nconsumer, business and government spending, partially offset by weaker housing market activity. With support from lower interest rates andexpansionary fiscal policies, including a possible reduction in the corporate tax rate, the economy is projected to continue growing at a healthy rat e\\nof 2.2% in 2025. While employment growth remains solid, the unemployment rate increased from a half-century low of 3.4% in April 2023 to 4.1% inOctober 2024 and is projected to rise slightly to 4.3% in early 2025. The easing in labour market conditions has reduced pressure on inflation,resulting in year-over-year growth in the consumer price index moderating to 2.6% in October 2024. The Federal Reserve lowered its key lending ratefor the first time in four years in September 2024 by 50 basis points and again in November by 25 basis points, and is projected to reduce the ratefurther by a cumulative 125 basis points to a range of 3.25% to 3.50% by late 2025. Growth in residential mortgage balances has slowedconsiderably to 1.9% year-over-year in October 2024 due to ongoing weakness in home sales, but will likely strengthen moderately in 2025 givenanticipated declines in mortgage rates. Despite increased credit card use, year-over-year growth in consumer loan balances decelerated to 1.5% inOctober 2024, but is projected to grow in 2025 due to lower interest rates. Growth in commercial, industrial and commercial real estate creditremains weak due to still elevated borrowing costs, stricter lending conditions and weakness in the office real estate market, though it is expected t o\\nstrengthen in 2025 in response to lower interest rates.\\nThe economic outlook is subject to several risks that could lead to a less favourable outcome for the North American economy. These include\\npotential higher tariffs on U.S. imports, an escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, heightened tensions between the United States an d\\nChina over trade relations and Taiwan, tensions between Canada and India, and a possible strike by U.S. East and Gulf Coast dockworkers inJanuary 2025. In addition, the Canadian dollar faces downside risks from possible U.S. tariffs and the upcoming renegotiation of the Canada-UnitedStates-Mexico Trade Agreement (CUSMA) in 2026.

Net interest income, excluding tradin g, is presented on a basis that excludes trading-related interest incom e.\\nNet Interest Margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, exp ressed as a percentage or in basi s points. Net interest margin,\\nexcluding trading net interest income, and tradi ng and insurance average assets is calculated in th e same manner, excluding trading-related intere st\\nincome, and trading and insurance earning assets.\\nAverage Earning Assets represent the daily average balance of deposits at central b anks, deposits with other banks, securities borrowed or\\npurchased under resale agreements, securities and loans over the period.\\nTrading-Related Revenue comprises net interest income and non-interest revenue ea rned from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions\\nundertaken for trading purposes. We earn revenue from profitably managi ng our positions with clients and, on a limited basis, from our principal\\ntrading positions, subject to prescribed limits. The management of these p ositions typically includes marking them to market on a daily basis. Since\\ntrading activities and related risk management s trategies can periodically shift trading income between net interest income and non-interest inco me,\\nwe view total trading income as the most appropriate measure of trading performance.\\nNet Interest Income\\nReported net interest income was $19,468 million, an increase of $787 million or 4% from the prior year, and adjusted net interest incomewas $18,921 million, a decrease of $173 million or 1% from the prior year.\\nThe increase in reported net interest income primarily reflected the reversal of accrued interest on the fiscal 2022 legal provision in the current\\nyear and the impact of fair value management actions related to Bank of the West in the prior year. Adjusted net interest income decreased, reflectingstrong growth in Canadian P&C driven by higher balances and margins, higher balances in U.S. P&C and an increase in non-trading interest income inBMO Capital Markets, more than offset by lower net interest income in Corporate Services and lower trading-related net interest income. Trading-related net interest income was $169 million, a decrease of $731 million from the prior year, and was largely offset in trading non-interest revenue.\\nBMO’s overall reported net interest margin of 1.57% decreased 6 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted net interest margin, excluding\\ntrading-related net interest income, and trading and insurance assets was 1.85%, a decrease of 3 basis points, primarily due to lower net interestincome and higher low-yielding assets in Corporate Services, partially offset by higher margins in BMO Capital Markets and Canadian P&C.\\nChange in Net Interest Income, Average Earning Assets and Net Interest Margin(1)\\nTABLE 10\\nNet interest margin\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted) Net interest income (2) Average earning assets (3) (in basis points)\\nFor the year ended October 31 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\\nCanadian P&C 8,852 8,043 319,795 296,164 277 272\\nU.S. P&C 8,162 7,607 215,987 195,363 378 389\\nPersonal and Commercial Banking (P&C) 17,014 15,650 535,782 491,527 318 318\\nAll other operating groups and Corporate Services (4) 2,454 3,031 701,463 654,343 na na\\nTotal reported 19,468 18,681 1,237,245 1,145,870 157 163\\nTotal adjusted 18,921 19,094 1,237,245 1,145,870 153 167\\nTrading net interest income, trading and insurance assets 169 900 222,149 180,005 na na\\nTotal reported, excluding trading and insurance 19,299 17,781 1,015,096 965,865 190 184\\nTotal adjusted, excluding trading and insurance 18,752 18,194 1,015,096 965,865 185 188\\nU.S. P&C (US$ in millions) 6,006 5,635 158,919 144,732 378 389\\n(1) Adjusted results and ratios are on a non-GAAP basis and are discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\n(2) Operating group revenue is presented on a taxable equivalent basis (teb) in net interest income.

We view total trading-related revenue as the most appropriate measure of trading performance. Reported trading-relatedrevenue on a teb basis was $2,568 million, an increase of $1,563 million, primarily due to the impact of fair value management actions related to theacquisition of Bank of the West in the prior year. Adjusted trading-related revenue on a teb basis decreased $65 million or 2%. Interest rate trading-related revenue increased $233 million or 30%, due to higher levels of client activity. Equities trading-related revenue decreased $150 millionor 16%, including the impact of the elimination of the deduction for certain Canadian dividends. Foreign exchange and commodities trading-relatedrevenue decreased $59 million or 9% and $42 million or 22%, respectively, driven by lower levels of client activity. Adjusted other trading-relatedrevenue decreased $47 million.\\nRefer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management – Market Risk section for more information on trading-related revenue.\\nTotal Provision for Credit Losses\\nTABLE 13\\n(Canadian $ in millions) Canadian P&C U.S. P&C Total P&CBMO Wealth\\nManagementBMO Capital\\nMarketsCorporate\\nServices Total Bank\\n2024\\nProvision for credit losses on impaired loans 1,326 1,274 2,600 26 367 73 3,066\\nProvision for (recovery of) credit losses on performing loans 333 389 722 5 2 (34) 695\\nTotal provision for credit losses 1,659 1,663 3,322 31 369 39 3,761\\nTotal PCL-to-average net loans and acceptances (%) 0.51 0.82 0.63 0.07 0.45 nm 0.57\\nPCL on impaired loans-to-average net loans and acceptances (%) 0.41 0.63 0.49 0.06 0.44 nm 0.47\\n2023\\nProvision for credit losses on impaired loans 724 364 1,088 5 9 78 1,180Provision for credit losses on performing loans 185 142 327 13 9 649 998\\nTotal provision for credit losses 909 506 1,415 18 18 727 2,178\\nInitial provision for credit losses on purchased performing loans\\n(1) – – – – – (705) (705)\\nAdjusted total provision for credit losses (2) 909 506 1,415 18 18 22 1,473\\nTotal PCL-to-average net loans and acceptances (%) 0.30 0.27 0.29 0.05 0.02 nm 0.35\\nPCL on impaired loans-to-average net loans and acceptances (%) 0.24 0.19 0.22 0.01 0.01 nm 0.19\\n(1) Initial provision for credit losses on the purchased Bank of the West performing loan portfolio, recorded in Corporate Services.\\n(2) Adjusted results exclude certain items from reported results and are used to calculate our adjusted measures as presented in the table above.

PCL on impaired loans was $3,066 million, an increase of $1,886 million from the prior year, with higher provisionsacross all operating segments, primarily the U.S. corporate and commercial portfolio, as certain client cohorts experienced the impact of prolonge d\\nelevated interest rates, tightening credit conditions, as well as shifting consumer demand for products and services. PCL on impaired loans as apercentage of average net loans and acceptances was 47 basis points, compared with 19 basis points in the prior year. PCL on performing loanswas $695 million in the current year, compared with $998 million on a reported basis and $293 million on an adjusted basis in the prior year. PCL onperforming loans in the current year was primarily driven by portfolio credit migration, uncertainty in credit conditions and model updates, partia lly\\noffset by a net improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, including the adoption of a fourth economic scenario in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\\nNote 4 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements provides additional information on PCL, including on a geographic basis.

Operating segment results include allocations from Corporate Services fortreasury-related revenue, corporate and T&O costs, and capital.\\nBMO employs funds transfer pricing and liquidity transfer pricing between corporate treasury and the operating segments in order to assign cost\\nor credit on assets and liabilities to facilitate effective pricing and business decision-making, and to help assess the profitability performance of each\\nline of business. These practices also capture the cost of holding supplemental liquid assets to meet contingent liquidity requirements, as well asfacilitating the management of interest rate and liquidity risk within our risk appetite framework and regulatory requirements. We review our trans fer\\npricing methodologies at least annually in order to align with our interest rate, liquidity and funding risk management practices, and update these a s\\nappropriate.\\nThe costs of Corporate Units and T&O services are largely allocated to the four operating segments, with any remaining amounts retained in\\nCorporate Services. Certain expenses directly incurred to support a specific operating segment are generally allocated to that operating segment.Other expenses are generally allocated across the operating segments in amounts that are reasonably reflective of the level of support provided toeach operating segment. We review our expense allocation methodologies at least annually, and update these as appropriate.\\nPeriodically, certain lines of business and units within our organizational structure are realigned within an operating segment or transferred\\nbetween operating segments and Corporate Services to support our strategic priorities. Allocations of revenue, expenses, provisions for income ta xes\\nand capital from Corporate Services to the operating groups are updated to better align with these changes.\\nCapital is allocated to the operating segments based on the amount of regulatory capital required to support business activities. Effective\\nfiscal 2024, our capital allocation rate increased to 11.5% of risk-weighted assets, compared with 11.0% in fiscal 2023, in order to reflect an increa se\\nin capital requirements. Unallocated capital is reported in Corporate Services. We review our capital allocation methodologies at least annually, and\\nupdate these as appropriate.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17), and retrospectively applied it to fiscal 2023\\nresults and opening retained earnings as at November 1, 2022. Insurance results are now presented in non-interest revenue under insurance serviceresults and insurance investment results. Insurance service results include insurance revenue, insurance service expenses and reinsurance resul ts.\\nInsurance investment results include net returns on insurance-related assets and the impact of the change in discount rates and financial assumptio ns\\non insurance contract liabilities. As a result of the transition to IFRS 17, we no longer report insurance claims, commissions and changes in policybenefits as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\nUpon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for the measurement of investment properties under IAS 40, Investment\\nProperties (IAS 40), recorded in insurance-related assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet from cost to fair value. This change was applied\\nretrospectively to fiscal 2023 results and opening retained earnings as at November 1, 2022.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 33\\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nThese changes did not have a material impact on regulatory capital ratios. Refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section for further\\ndetails.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for securities transactions from the settlement date to the\\ntrade date. This change was applied retrospectively, as if we had always recorded securities transactions on the trade date. As a result, there was anincrease in other assets and other liabilities due to the earlier recognition of transactions, as well as the reclassification of certain balance she et items.\\nFiscal 2023 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s accounting policy change.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the allocation of certain items from Corporate Services to the operating groups was updated to align with\\nunderlying business activity, including transfer pricing methodologies. Comparative results and ratios have been reclassified to conform with th e\\ncurrent period’s presentation.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, balances and associated revenue, expenses and provisions for credit losses related to our Canadian and\\nU.S. indirect retail auto financing business, previously reported in Personal and Commercial Banking, are reported in Corporate Services, reflect ing the\\nexit and wind-down of this business unit. Fiscal 2023 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s presentation.\\nWe analyze revenue at the consolidated level based on GAAP revenue as reported in the audited annual consolidated financial statements, rather\\nthan on a taxable equivalent basis (teb), which is consistent with our Canadian banking peer group. Like many banks, BMO analyzes revenue on a tebbasis at the operating segment level. Revenue and the provision for income taxes in BMO Capital Markets and U.S. P&C are increased on tax-exemptsecurities to equivalent pre-tax amounts in order to facilitate comparisons of income from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The offset to the segmentteb adjustments is reflected in Corporate Services revenue and provision for (recovery of) income taxes.

Net interest income increased $809 million or 10%,\\ndue to higher balances and net interest margins. Non-interest revenue increased $71 million or 3%, primarily due to the inclusion of AIR MILES, highermutual fund distribution fee revenue and card-related revenue, partially offset by lower commercial lending fee revenue. Net interest marginof 2.77% increased 5 basis points from the prior year, due to higher loan margins and deposits growing faster than loans, partially offset by lowerdeposit margins. The impact of the transition of bankers’ acceptances exposures to loans in Commercial Banking resulted in lower non-interestrevenue offset in net interest income, with a modest reduction in the net interest margin.\\nPersonal and Business Banking revenue increased $694 million or 9%, due to higher net interest income and non-interest revenue. Commercial\\nBanking revenue increased $186 million or 6%, due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue.\\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1,659 million, an increase of $750 million from the prior year.

With inflation returning to targete d\\nlevels, the Bank of Canada lowered its key policy rate by a cumulative 125 basis points starting in June 2024, although policy rates remain restrictive .\\nGDP growth slowed slightly compared with the prior year and the unemployment rate increased by almost 1% to 6.5% as at October 2024.\\nThe higher interest rate environment continued to drive steady growth in term deposits for most of fiscal 2024, including ongoing migration from\\nchequing and savings accounts, which began to abate in recent months as interest rates declined and equity markets improved. In response to slowerhousing market activity, mortgage growth moderated from the prior year, but remained healthy, supported by robust population growth and strongcustomer acquisition. Credit card growth remained strong, supported by continued account growth and consumer spending, and higher revolvingbalances. Business lending growth eased, as clients continued to manage their balance sheets in the higher interest rate environment. Credit lossesincreased, with higher consumer delinquencies and insolvencies reflecting rising unemployment, as well as higher impairment rates for businessbanking and commercial clients.\\nThe Canadian economy is expected to expand moderately in 2025 and the Bank of Canada is anticipated to reduce interest rates by an\\nadditional 125 basis points to 2.5% by June 2025. Deposit growth is expected to continue to slow, reflecting a decrease in demand for term depositsas customers seeking higher yielding products migrate to equity markets. Mortgage growth is forecasted to gradually pick up as housing marketactivity improves and new mortgage rules take effect. Credit card growth is expected to ease from current high levels. Business lending is expectedto improve at a moderate pace in 2025 in response to lower interest rates. The lower cost of borrowing is expected to ease pressure on householdand business balance sheets through the year.\\nWe continue to invest in our business with a focus on delivering exceptional customer solutions and advice, together with leading digital\\nexperiences, and execute on our strategy to drive business growth in any environment.\\nThe Canadian economic environment in calendar 2024 and the outlook for calendar 2025 are discussed in more detail in the Economic\\nDevelopments and Outlook section.\\nCautionThis Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking section contains forward-looking statements.

The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar\\nincreased growth in revenue, expenses and net income by 1%, respectively. All amounts in the remainder of this section are presented on a U.S.dollar basis.\\nReported net income was $1,352 million, a decrease of $491 million or 27% from the prior year, as higher revenue was more than offset by a\\nhigher provision for credit losses and higher expenses.\\nTotal revenue was $7,185 million, an increase of $385 million or 6% from the prior year, reflecting the inclusion of one additional quarter of Bank\\nof the West results. Net interest income increased $371 million or 7%, primarily due to higher balances, partially offset by lower net interest margin s.\\nNon-interest revenue increased $14 million from the prior year. Net interest margin of 3.78% decreased 11 basis points from the prior year, primarilydue to lower deposit and loan margins, partially offset by deposits growing faster than loans.\\nPersonal and Business Banking revenue increased $162 million or 6% due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest\\nrevenue. Commercial Banking revenue increased $223 million or 5%, due to higher net interest income and non-interest revenue.\\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1,218 million, an increase of $842 million from the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired\\nloans was $935 million, an increase of $665 million due to higher provisions in Commercial Banking and Personal and Business Banking. There wasa $283 million provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current year, compared with a $106 million provision in the prior year.\\nNon-interest expense was $4,339 million, an increase of $306 million or 8% from the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of one additional\\nquarter of Bank of the West, net of realized cost synergies.\\nAverage gross loans and acceptances increased $10.2 billion or 7% from the prior year to $150.7 billion, primarily due to the impact of one\\nadditional quarter of Bank of the West results. Personal and Business Banking loan balances increased 15%, net of the sale of the recreational vehicleloan portfolio in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and Commercial Banking loan balances increased 5%. Average total deposits increased $16.3 billio n\\nor 11% to $163.5 billion. Personal and Business Banking deposits increased 19% and Commercial Banking balances increased 4%.\\nFor further information on non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios in this 2024 Operating Groups Performance Review section, refer to the\\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\\nU.S. P&C performance in fiscal 2024 benefitted from one additional quarter of results from Bank of the West and the achievement of expensesynergies following the successful conversion, integration and brand alignment across our U.S. markets, but was negatively impacted by a morechallenging banking environment. U.S. GDP growth in 2024 moderated slightly from 2023, but remained strong. However, the U.S. banking industryexperienced muted loan demand and continued competition for deposits, reflecting the high interest rate environment, which increased funding cost s\\nand put pressure on net interest margins. Year-over-year growth in overall commercial loan balances decelerated in response to high interest rates,weakness in the commercial real estate market and uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election, while mortgage and home equityloans moderated amid a weaker housing market. Deposit growth improved in the second half of the year, benefitting from good customer acquisitionas a result of investments in marketing and digital capabilities. Provisions for credit losses have increased and were elevated in the second half of t he\\nyear, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates on debt servicing costs, changes in consumer preferences for products and services, and weaknes s\\nin the commercial real estate and transportation sectors.\\nThe U.S. economy is projected to grow at a healthy but more moderate pace in calendar 2025, supported by lower interest rates and\\nexpansionary fiscal policies, including a possible reduction in the corporate tax rate. The Federal Reserve lowered its key lending rate for the firs t time\\nin four years in September 2024 by 50 basis points and will likely continue to reduce rates in 2025. As a result, business and consumer lendingdemand is expected to improve through fiscal 2025 while deposit costs should stabilize. The lower cost of borrowing is expected to ease pressure onhousehold and business balance sheets.\\nLeveraging our diversified Commercial Banking franchise, an expanded Personal and Business Banking franchise and a national digital deposit\\nplatform, we are well-positioned to drive profitable growth and customer loyalty. We will remain focused on driving efficiencies by simplifying andstreamlining operations and investing in digital capabilities.\\nThe U.S. economic environment in calendar 2024 and the outlook for calendar 2025 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Developments\\nand Outlook section.\\nCautionThis U.S. Personal and Commercial Banking section contains forward-looking statements.

IFRS 17\\nprovides a comprehensive approach to accounting for all types of insurance contracts and replaced IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts. Insurance results are\\nnow presented in non-interest revenue under insurance service results and insurance investment results. As a result of the adoption and retrospecti ve\\napplication of IFRS 17 to our fiscal 2023 results, we no longer report insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities. For fu rther\\ndetails, refer to Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nReported net income was $1,248 million, an increase of $102 million or 9% from the prior year. Wealth and Asset Management reported net income\\nwas $1,012 million, an increase of $188 million or 23%, and included one additional quarter of Bank of the West results, compared with the prioryear. Insurance net income was $236 million, a decrease of $86 million or 27%.\\nTotal revenue was $5,646 million, an increase of $235 million or 4%. Revenue in Wealth and Asset Management was $5,279 million, an increase\\nof $349 million or 7%, due to growth in client assets, including the impact of stronger global markets, and higher revenue from online brokeragetransactions, partially offset by lower net interest income due to lower margins. Insurance revenue was $367 million, a decrease of $114 million,reflecting changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS 17.\\nThe total provision for credit losses was $31 million, compared with an $18 million provision in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on\\nimpaired loans increased $21 million and the provision for credit losses on performing loans decreased $8 million.\\nNon-interest expense was $3,968 million, an increase of $90 million or 2% from the prior year, due to higher revenue-based costs and our\\ninvestment in talent, partially offset by operational efficiencies.\\nAssets under management increased $89.8 billion or 27% from the prior year to $422.7 billion, driven by stronger global markets and higher net\\nclient assets. Assets under administration decreased $55.1 billion or 13% to $361.2 billion, primarily due to the exit of our Institutional Trust Ser vices\\noperations in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by stronger global markets. Average gross loans increased 5% and average deposits we re\\nrelatively unchanged from the prior year.\\nFor further information on non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios in this 2024 Operating Groups Performance Review section, refer to the\\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\\nBMO Wealth Management results benefitted from growing momentum in equity markets through fiscal 2024, with a moderation of inflationarypressures and declining interest rates in the second half of the year. Higher assets under management from stronger global markets and net newasset flows supported revenue growth, offsetting the industry-wide reduction in asset yields and lower net interest margins from deposit migrationto higher yielding assets.

BMO Global Asset Management and Insurance expanded their product offerings in key growth areas to provide innovative,competitive product solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients.\\nThe outlook for lower interest rates and stronger market activity should support continued growth in fiscal 2025.

BMO Capital Markets’ performance in recent quarters reflected the impact of improving market conditions, with resilienttrading results driven by stronger client flows in fiscal 2024, as well as an increase in underwriting activity, particularly in new debt issuances.\\nOver the past eight quarters, the higher interest rate environment has had a meaningful impact on credit outcomes for certain client cohorts,\\nresulting in increasing provisions on impaired loans from very low levels and higher provisions on performing loans driven by credit migration.Performing loan provisions were also impacted by changes in the macroeconomic outlook and scenario weighting.\\nNon-interest expense increased due to the acquisition of Bank of the West, and has since reflected strong expense management, while we\\ncontinue to invest in our business to drive revenue growth. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 benefitted from the reversal of the legal provision. Thethird quarter of fiscal 2023 included severance costs associated with accelerating operational efficiencies across the enterprise, which combine d with\\nthe benefit of realized cost synergies related to Bank of the West, have reduced expense growth in recent quarters.\\nThe effective tax rate has varied with legislative changes; changes in tax policy, including their interpretation by tax authorities and the courts;\\nearnings mix, including the relative proportion of earnings attributable to the different jurisdictions in which we operate, the level of pre-tax in come,\\nand the level of investments or securities which generate tax credits, or tax-exempt income from securities. The reported effective tax rate wasimpacted by the elimination of the income tax deduction for certain Canadian dividends in fiscal 2024.\\nFor further information on non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios in this Summary Quarterly Earnings Trends section, refer to the Non-GAAP\\nand Other Financial Measures section.\\nReview of Fourth Quarter 2024 Performance\\nQ4 2024 vs. Q4 2023\\nNet Income\\nReported net income was $2,304 million, an increase of $594 million or 35% from the prior year, and adjusted net income was $1,542 million, a\\ndecrease of $701 million or 31%. Adjusted results excluded the specified items noted in the Summary Quarterly Earnings Trends section.\\nReported net income increased from the prior year, primarily due to the reversal of the fiscal 2022 legal provision, including accrued interest, and\\nlower acquisition and integration costs, compared with the prior year. The decrease in adjusted net income reflected a higher provision for creditlosses, partially offset by lower expenses, with revenue relatively unchanged from the prior year. Reported and adjusted net income decreased acros s\\nall operating segments. Corporate Services recorded net income on a reported basis, compared with a net loss in the prior year, and a lower net losson an adjusted basis.\\nRevenue\\nReported revenue was $8,957 million, an increase of $638 million or 8% from the prior year, due to the reversal of accrued interest on the legalprovision in the current year. Adjusted revenue was $8,368 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year, with higher non-interest revenuepartially offset by lower net interest income. Adjusted net interest income decreased, primarily due to lower trading-related net interest income a nd\\nlower net interest income in Corporate Services due to lower net accretion of purchase accounting fair value marks, partially offset by higher netinterest income in Canadian P&C due to higher balances and higher non-trading interest income in BMO Capital Markets. Non-interest revenueincreased, primarily driven by higher trading revenue, investment management and custodial fee revenue and mutual fund fee revenue, partiallyoffset by lower insurance-related revenue reflecting changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS 17, the impact of mark-downs onthe held-for-sale loan portfolio and lower lending fee revenue, largely offset in net interest income reflecting the transition of bankers’ accepta nces\\nexposures to loans, and lower card fee revenue.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 53\\n\\n\\n## Page 42', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 4, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667285', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 42\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nProvision for Credit Losses\\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1,523 million, compared with a provision of $446 million in the prior year. Total provision for credit losses as a\\npercentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 91 basis points, compared with 27 basis points in the prior year. The provision for creditlosses on impaired loans was $1,107 million, an increase of $699 million, due to higher provisions across operating segments, primarily in the U.S.corporate and commercial portfolio, and in the Canadian unsecured segments of the consumer portfolio. The provision for credit losses on impairedloans as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 66 basis points, compared with 25 basis points in the prior year. There wasa $416 million provision for credit losses on performing loans, compared with a $38 million provision in the prior year, primarily driven by portfoliocredit migration, as well as uncertainty in credit conditions.\\nNon-Interest Expense\\nReported non-interest expense was $4,427 million, a decrease of $1,252 million or 22% from the prior year, and adjusted non-interest expensewas $4,876 million, a decrease of $100 million or 2%. Reported results reflected the reversal of the legal provision and the impact of loweracquisition and integration costs in the current year. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased, primarily due to our continued focus on operationa l\\nefficiencies, including realized cost synergies related to Bank of the West, and lower premises costs, including the charge in the prior year related to\\nthe consolidation of BMO real estate, and other operating costs.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThe reported provision for income taxes was $703 million, an increase of $219 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and the adjustedprovision for income taxes was $427 million, a decrease of $241 million. The reported effective tax rate was 23.4%, compared with 22.1% in thefourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7%, compared with 22.9%. The change in the reported effective tax raterelative to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the impact of higher income in the current year, and the change in the adjusted effectivetax rate was primarily due to earnings mix, including the impact of lower income in the current quarter.\\nQ4 2024 vs. Q3 2024\\nReported net income increased $439 million or 24% from the prior quarter, and adjusted net income decreased $439 million or 22%. Reported netincome increased primarily due to the reversal of the legal provision. The decrease in adjusted net income reflected a higher provision for creditlosses and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenue. Reported and adjusted net income decreased across all operating segments. Corporat e\\nServices recorded net income on a reported basis, compared with a net loss in the prior quarter, and a lower net loss on an adjusted basis. Reportedrevenue increased $765 million or 9% from the prior quarter, and adjusted revenue increased $162 million or 2%. Reported revenue reflected highernet interest income, primarily driven by the reversal of accrued interest on the legal provision. Reported and adjusted revenue reflected higher netinterest income, driven by higher Corporate Services and Canadian P&C net interest income, as well as higher non-trading interest income in BMOCapital Markets, partially offset by lower trading-related net interest income, and higher non-interest revenue, driven by higher trading revenue and\\nunderwriting and advisory fee revenue, partially offset by lower card and lending fee revenue. Reported non-interest expense decreased $412 millio n\\nor 9% from the prior quarter, due to the reversal of the legal provision, and adjusted non-interest expense increased $179 million or 4%, primarilydue to higher professional fees and higher association, clearing and annual regulator fees. Total provision for credit losses increased $617 millio n\\nfrom the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans increased $279 million, due to higher provisions in the corporate andcommercial portfolio.

This section summarizes BMO’s performance in fiscal 2023\\nrelative to fiscal 2022.\\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Bank of the West, which contributed to the increase in revenue, expenses and provision for\\ncredit losses beginning the second quarter of fiscal 2023, with operating results primarily allocated to our U.S. P&C and BMO Wealth Managementbusinesses. In addition, we completed the acquisition of the AIR MILES Reward Program (AIR MILES) on June 1, 2023, which contributed to theincrease in revenue and expenses in our Canadian P&C business beginning the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\\nPrior to November 1, 2022, we presented revenue on a basis net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities\\n(CCPB). Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we no longer report CCPB, given the adoption and retrospective application of IFRS 17, Insurance\\nContracts (IFRS 17). Revenue, net of CCPB, as well as other adjusted results and ratios referred to below, are presented on a non-GAAP basis and are\\ndiscussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nIn addition, certain lines of business and units within our organizational structure are periodically realigned to support our strategic prioritie s and\\nallocations of revenue, expenses, provision for income taxes and capital from Corporate Services to the operating groups are updated to better alignwith these changes.

Details on our enterprise-wide capital management practices and strategies can be found below.\\nEnterprise-Wide Capital Management\\nCapital Management\\nObjective\\nBMO is committed to a disciplined approach to capital management that balances the interests and requirements of our shareholders, regulators,depositors, fixed income investors and rating agencies. We recognize the global trend of rising regulatory capital requirements, and manage ourcapital position accordingly. Our objective is to maintain a strong and optimized capital position in a cost-effective structure that:\\n‰Is appropriate given BMO’s target regulatory capital ratios and internal assessment of economic capital requirements\\n‰Underpins BMO’s operating groups’ business strategies and considers the market environment\\n‰Supports depositor, investor and regulator confidence, and dividends, while building long-term shareholder value\\n‰Is consistent with BMO’s target credit ratings.\\nFramework\\nCapital Supply\\nCapital available\\nto support risksCapital Demand\\nCapital required to support\\nthe risks underlying our\\nbusiness activitiesCapital adequacy\\nassessment of capital\\ndemand and supply\\nThe principles and key elements of our capital management framework are outlined in our Capital Management Corporate Policy and in the annual\\ncapital plan, which includes the results of the comprehensive Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\\nICAAP is an integrated process that involves the application of stress testing and other tools to assess capital adequacy on both a regulatory and\\nan economic basis. The results of this process inform and support the establishment of capital targets and the implementation of capital strategiesthat take into consideration the strategic direction and risk appetite of the enterprise. The annual capital plan is developed considering the resul ts of\\nICAAP and in conjunction with the annual business plan, promoting alignment between business and risk strategies, regulatory and economic capitalrequirements and the availability of capital. Enterprise-wide stress testing and scenario analysis are conducted in order to assess the impact of va rious\\nstress conditions on our risk profile and capital requirements.\\nOur capital management framework seeks to ensure that the bank is adequately capitalized given the risks we assume in the normal course of\\nbusiness, as well as under stress, and supports the determination of limits, targets and performance measures that are applied in managing balancesheet positions, risk levels and capital requirements at the consolidated entity, legal entity and operating group levels. We seek to optimize ourcapital through efficient use of our balance sheet and the related risks we undertake, and may employ levers such as risk transfer transactions andthe sale of assets. We evaluate assessments of actual and forecasted capital adequacy against our capital targets throughout the year, includingconsideration of changes in our business activities and risk profile, the operating environment, our competitors, and current and future regulator y\\nexpectations.\\nWe allocate capital to operating groups in order to evaluate business performance, and we consider capital implications in our strategic, tactical\\nand transactional decision-making. By allocating capital to operating groups, setting and monitoring capital limits and metrics, and measuring th e\\ngroups’ performance against these limits and metrics, we seek to optimize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, while maintaining awell-capitalized position.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 59\\n\\n\\n## Page 48\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nThis approach is intended to protect interested parties from the risks inherent in our various businesses, while still providing the flexibility to\\ndeploy resources in support of strategic growth activities and to maintain dividends.\\nRefer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section for further discussion of the risks underlying our business.\\nGovernance\\nThe Board of Directors, either directly or through its Risk Review Committee, provides ultimate oversight and approval of capital management,including the bank’s Capital Management Corporate Policy, capital plan and capital adequacy assessments. The Board of Directors regularly reviewsthe bank’s capital position and key capital management activities. In addition, the capital adequacy assessment results determined by ICAAP areapproved by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Risk Review Committee. The Enterprise Capital Management Committee providessenior management oversight, including the review of significant capital management policies, issues and activities, and the capital required tosupport the execution of our enterprise-wide strategy. Finance and Risk Management are responsible for the design and implementation of ourcorporate policies and frameworks related to capital and risk management, as well as ICAAP. The Corporate Audit Division, as the third line ofdefence, verifies adherence to controls and identifies opportunities to strengthen our processes. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk ManagementFramework section for further discussion.\\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\\nRegulatory capital requirements for BMO are determined in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI, which are based on the Basel III frameworkdeveloped by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The current minimum risk-based capital ratios set out in OSFI’s Capital AdequacyRequirements (CAR) Guideline are a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 6.0% and a Total Capital Ratio of 8.0%. Inaddition to these minimum capital requirements, OSFI also requires domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), including BMO, to hold Pillar 1and Pillar 2 buffers, which are meant to be used as a normal first response in periods of stress. Pillar 1 buffers include a capital conservation bufferof 2.5%, a D-SIB Common Equity Tier 1 surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer, which can range from 0% to 2.5%, depending on a bank’sexposure to jurisdictions that have activated the buffer. If a bank’s capital ratios fall below the range of the combined minimum and Pillar 1 buffers,restrictions on discretionary distributions of earnings (such as dividends, share repurchases and discretionary compensation) could ensue, with the\\ndegree of such restrictions varying according to the position of the bank’s ratios. Pillar 2 buffers address risks associated with systemic vulnerab ilities\\nand include the domestic stability buffer (DSB), which can range from 0% to 4.0% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and was 3.5% as atOctober 31, 2024. The buffer level is set twice a year by OSFI, in June and December, but OSFI can make a change at any time when needed. UnderOSFI guidelines, breaches of the DSB do not automatically result in constraints on capital distributions. In the event of a breach, OSFI would require a\\nremediation plan and would expect the plan to be executed in a timely manner. Banks may be required to hold additional regulatory buffers that areapplicable to the capital ratios, the Leverage and the Total Loss Absorbing Capital (TLAC) Ratios.\\nTLAC comprises the aggregate of Total Capital and Other TLAC instruments that allow conversion, in whole or in part, into common shares under\\ntheCanada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act and meet the eligibility criteria under the TLAC Guideline. Other TLAC comprises senior unsecured debt,\\nsubject to Canada’s Bank Recapitalization (Bail-In) Regime, with an original term to maturity of greater than 400 days and a remaining term tomaturity of greater than 365 days. The minimum TLAC requirements set by OSFI as at October 31, 2024 are a TLAC Ratio of 21.5% of RWA and a TLACLeverage Ratio of 6.75%.\\nThe current minimum Leverage Ratio set out in OSFI’s Leverage Requirements (LR) Guideline is 3.0%. Effective February 1, 2023, D-SIBs were\\nrequired to meet an additional 0.5% buffer requirement for the Leverage and TLAC Leverage Ratios.\\nOSFI’s requirements as at October 31, 2024 are summarized in the following table.\\nTABLE 29\\n(% of risk-weighted assets or leverage exposures)Minimum capital,\\nleverage and TLAC\\nrequirementsTotal Pillar 1 Capital\\nbuffers (1)Tier 1 Capital\\nbuffer (2)Domestic stability\\nbuffer (3)Minimum capital,\\nleverage and TLAC\\nrequirements including\\ncapital buffersBMO capital, leverage\\nand TLAC ratios as at\\nOctober 31, 2024\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio 4.5% 3.5% na 3.5% 11.5% 13.6%\\nTier 1 Capital Ratio 6.0% 3.5% na 3.5% 13.0% 15.4%Total Capital Ratio 8.0% 3.5% na 3.5% 15.0% 17.6%TLAC Ratio 21.5% na na 3.5% 25.0% 29.3%Leverage Ratio 3.0% na 0.5% na 3.5% 4.4%TLAC Leverage Ratio 6.75% na 0.5% na 7.25% 8.3%\\n(1) Pillar 1 Capital buffers, which will be met with CET1 Capital, include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, a Common Equity Tier 1 surcharge for D- SIBs of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer, as\\nprescribed by OSFI (immaterial for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024).\\n(2) D-SIBs are required to meet a 0.5% Tier 1 Capital buffer requirement for Leverage and TLAC Leverage Ratios.(3) The DSB buffer was confirmed at 3.5% in June 2024.\\nna – not applicable\\n60BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 49\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Regulatory Capital and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity Ratios\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital comprises common shareholders’ equity, including applicable contractual service margin, net of deductions\\nfor goodwill, intangible assets, pension assets, certain deferred tax assets and other items, which may include a portion of expected credit lossprovisions or a shortfall in allowances or other specified items.\\nTier 1 Capital comprises CET1 Capital and Additional Tier 1 (AT1) Capital .

Canada\\nDeposit Insurance Corporation has the power to trigger the conversion of bail-in debt into common shares. This statutory conversion supplementsNVCC securities, which must be converted in full prior to the conversion of bail-in debt.\\nRisk-Weighted Assets\\nRisk-weighted assets (RWA) measure a bank’s exposures, weighted for their relative risk and calculated in accordance with the regulatory capitalrules prescribed by OSFI, which include standardized and internal ratings or internal model approaches for credit and market risk, and standardizedapproaches for operational risk.\\nWe primarily use the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach to determine credit RWA in our portfolio. The IRB Approach includes the Foundation\\n(FIRB) Approach for exposures to financial institutions and large corporate portfolios, and the Advanced (AIRB) Approach for all other exposures. T he\\nAIRB Approach applies sophisticated techniques to measure RWA at the exposure level based on sound risk management principles, includingestimates of the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) risk parameters, as well as term to maturity and\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 61\\n\\n\\n## Page 50', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 5, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667300', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 50\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nasset class type, as prescribed by the OSFI rules. These risk parameters are determined using internal models that leverage historical portfolio dat a\\nsupplemented by benchmarking, as appropriate, and are updated periodically. Validation procedures related to these models are in place in order toquantify and differentiate risks appropriately. The FIRB Approach employs the same internal PD estimates as the AIRB Approach, but LGD and EADparameters are prescribed by OSFI. Credit risk RWA related to certain Canadian and U.S. portfolios are determined under the Standardized Approachusing prescribed risk weights based on external ratings, counterparty type or product type. These portfolios reflect current waivers and exemption st o\\nthe IRB Approach approved by OSFI. For further discussion of these respective approaches noted above, refer to the Credit and Counterparty Risk –Credit and Counterparty Risk Measurement section.\\nWe use the Standardized Approach for determining market risk and operational risk capital requirements.In calculating regulatory capital ratios, total RWA must be increased when the capital floor amount calculated under the standardized approaches,\\nmultiplied by a capital floor adjustment factor, is higher than a similar calculation using the more risk-sensitive internal modelled approaches, w here\\napplicable. Other than during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the capital floor was not operative for BMO in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\\nRegulatory Capital Developments\\nThe revised CAR Guideline, published by OSFI in October 2023, was effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and includes heightened regulatorycapital requirements for mortgages with growing balances where payments are insufficient to cover the interest component, as well as otherchanges that provide further clarification on the application of the guideline.\\nEffective November 1, 2023, the DSB was raised from 3.0% to 3.5% of total RWA.The domestic implementation of the Basel III Reforms related to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, along with an increase in the\\ncapital floor adjustment from 65.0% to 67.5%, became effective the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On July 5, 2024, OSFI announced a one-year delay inthe next increase of the capital floor adjustment factor to allow OSFI time to consider the impact of the implementation of Basel III reforms in otherjurisdictions. With the one-year delay, the adjustment factor will remain at the current 67.5% for fiscal 2025 and will then rise by an additional 2.5%to 70.0% in fiscal 2026 and 72.5% in fiscal 2027.\\nThe Parental Stand-Alone (Solo) TLAC Framework for D-SIBs, published by OSFI on September 12, 2023, was effective in the first quarter of\\nfiscal 2024. The purpose of the Solo framework is to ensure a non-viable D-SIB has sufficient loss absorbing capacity on a stand-alone legal entitybasis to support its resolution, which would, in turn, facilitate an orderly resolution of the D-SIB while minimizing adverse impacts on the stabilit yo f\\nthe financial sector, ensuring the continuity of critical functions and minimizing taxpayers’ exposure to loss. We exceeded the minimum Solo TLACrequirement of 21.5%.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17). Upon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily\\nchanged our accounting policy for the measurement of investment properties under IAS 40, Investment Properties (IAS 40), recorded in insurance-\\nrelated assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, from cost value to fair value. This change did not have a material impact on regulatory capitalratios. Refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section for further details.\\nRegulatory Capital and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity Review\\nBMO is well-capitalized, with capital ratios that exceed OSFI’s published requirements for large Canadian banks, including a DSB of 3.5%. OurCET1 Ratio was 13.6% as at October 31, 2024, compared with 12.5% as at October 31, 2023. Our CET1 Ratio increased from the prior year, primarily asa result of internal capital generation, common shares issued under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (DRIP) andlower source-currency RWA. There was a positive impact to the ratio from the reversal of a fiscal 2022 legal provision associated with a predecessorbank, M&I Marshal and Ilsley Bank, which increased internal capital generation and reduced RWA.\\nOur Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital Ratios were 15.4% and 17.6%, respectively, as at October 31, 2024, compared with 14.1% and 16.2%,\\nrespectively, as at October 31, 2023. The Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital Ratios were higher, due to the same factors impacting the CET1 Ratio, as wellas the issuances of Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCN) totalling US$1.75 billion, partially offset by preferred share redemptions.\\nThe impact of foreign exchange movements on BMO’s capital ratios was largely offset. BMO’s investments in foreign operations are primarily\\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and the foreign exchange impact of U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA and capital deductions may result in variability in thebank’s capital ratios. We manage the impact of foreign exchange movements on RWA and capital deductions in our capital ratios.\\nOur Leverage Ratio was 4.4% as at October 31, 2024, an increase from 4.2% as at October 31, 2023, driven by higher Tier 1 Capital, partially\\noffset by higher leverage exposures.\\nAs at October 31, 2024, our TLAC Ratio was 29.3% and our TLAC Leverage Ratio was 8.3%, compared with 27.0% and 8.1%, respectively, as at\\nOctober 31, 2023.\\nWhile the ratios discussed above reflect our consolidated capital base, we conduct business through a variety of corporate structures, including\\nsubsidiaries. A framework is in place such that capital and funding are managed appropriately at the subsidiary level.\\nFollowing the acquisition of Bank of the West in fiscal 2023, our U.S. bank intermediate holding company BMO Financial Corp. (BFC) became a\\nCategory III institution under the Enhanced Prudential Standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). BFC is required to meet certainheightened regulatory standards related to capital, liquidity and risk management, including complying with FRB single counterparty credit limit s. BFC\\nis also subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST) requirements of the FRB on an\\nannual basis.\\nOn June 26, 2024, the FRB released its 2024 CCAR and DFAST results, and on August 28, 2024 announced individual large bank capital\\nrequirements, which were effective October 1, 2024. For BFC, the FRB determined a CET1 Ratio requirement of 10.0%, including the 4.5% minimumCET1 Ratio and a 5.5% stress capital buffer. BFC is well-capitalized, with a CET1 Ratio of 11.8% as at September 30, 2024.\\n62BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 51\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Regulatory Capital and TLAC(1)\\nTABLE 30\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted)\\nAs at October 31 2024 2023\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital: Instruments and Reserves\\nDirectly issued qualifying common share capital plus related stock surplus 24,275 23,269\\nRetained earnings 46,469 44,920\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (and other reserves) 5,419 1,862\\nGoodwill and other intangibles (net of related tax liability) (20,349) (20,899)\\nOther common equity Tier 1 capital deductions 1,240 3,762\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) 57,054 52,914\\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital: Instruments\\nDirectly issued qualifying Additional Tier 1 instruments plus related stock surplus 7,787 6,958\\nTotal regulatory adjustments applied to Additional Tier 1 Capital (106) (87)\\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital (AT1) 7,681 6,871\\nTier 1 Capital (T1 = CET1 + AT1) 64,735 59,785\\nTier 2 Capital: Instruments and Provisions\\nDirectly issued qualifying Tier 2 instruments plus related stock surplus 8,230 8,082\\nGeneral allowance 954 902\\nTotal regulatory adjustments to Tier 2 Capital (8) (51)\\nTier 2 Capital (T2) 9,176 8,933\\nTotal Capital (TC = T1 + T2) 73,911 68,718\\nNon-Regulatory Capital Elements of TLAC\\nDirectly issued qualifying Other TLAC instruments 49,465 45,773\\nTotal regulatory adjustments applied to Other TLAC (88) (89)\\nOther TLAC 49,377 45,684\\nTLAC (TLAC = TC + Other TLAC) 123,288 114,402\\nRisk-Weighted Assets and Leverage Ratio Exposures\\nRisk-Weighted Assets 420,838 424,197\\nLeverage Ratio Exposures 1,484,962 1,413,036\\nCapital Ratios (%)\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio 13.6 12.5\\nTier 1 Capital Ratio 15.4 14.1\\nTotal Capital Ratio 17.6 16.2\\nTLAC Ratio 29.3 27.0\\nLeverage Ratio 4.4 4.2\\nTLAC Leverage Ratio 8.3 8.1\\n(1) Calculated in accordance with OSFI’s CAR Guideline and LR Guideline, as applicable.

Based on a floor price of $5.00, these NVCC instruments would be converted intoapproximately 4.2 billion BMO common shares, assuming no accrued interest and no declared and unpaid dividends.\\nFurther details on subordinated debt and share capital are provided in Notes 16 and 17 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nDividends\\nDividends per common share declared in fiscal 2024 totalled $6.12, an increase of 6% from the prior year. Annual dividends declaredrepresented 64% of reported net income and 63% of adjusted net income available to common shareholders on a last twelve-month basis.\\nOur target dividend payout range (common share dividends as a percentage of net income available to shareholders, less preferred share\\ndividends and distributions on other equity instruments, based on earnings over the last twelve months) is 40% to 50%, providing shareholders witha competitive dividend yield. Our target dividend payout range seeks to provide shareholders with stable income, while retaining sufficient earnin gs\\nto support anticipated business growth, fund strategic investments and support capital adequacy.\\nAt year-end, our common shares provided an annualized dividend yield of 5% based on the year-end closing share price. On December 5, 2024,\\nwe announced that the Board of Directors had declared a quarterly dividend on common shares of $1.59 per share, an increase of $0.04 per sharefrom the prior quarter and 5% from the prior year. The dividend is payable on February 26, 2025 to shareholders of record on January 30, 2025.\\nShareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan\\nCommon shareholders may elect to have their cash dividends reinvested in common shares of BMO, in accordance with the DRIP.\\nIn the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024, common shares to supply the DRIP were issued from treasury at a 2% discount, calculated in\\naccordance with the terms of the DRIP. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, and until further notice, common shares to supply the DRIP will bepurchased on the open market without a discount. During fiscal 2023, common shares to supply the DRIP were issued from treasury at a 2% discount,calculated in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.\\nEligible Dividends Designation\\nFor the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any similar provincial and territorial legislation, BMO designates all dividends paid or deemed to\\nbe paid on both its common and preferred shares as “eligible dividends”, unless indicated otherwise.\\nCautionThis Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Sta tements.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nWe enter into a number of off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations, and these include structured entities (SEs), credit\\ninstruments and guarantees.\\nStructured Entities and Securitization\\nWe carry out certain business activities through arrangements involving SEs, using them to obtain sources of liquidity and manage capital bysecuritizing certain of our financial assets, to secure customer transactions, or to pass our credit risk exposure to holders of the vehicles’ securi ties. For\\nexample, we enter into transactions with SEs in which we transfer assets, including mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans,real estate lines of credit, auto loans and equipment loans, in order to obtain alternate sources of funding or as part of our trading activities. Note 6 of\\nthe audited annual consolidated financial statements describes the loan securitization activities carried out through third-party programs such as the\\nCanada Mortgage Bond Program and the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities Program. Note 7 of the audited annual consolidatedfinancial statements provides further details of our interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs. Under IFRS, we consolidate a SE if wecontrol the entity. We consolidate our own securitization vehicles, certain capital and funding vehicles, and other structured entities created to meet\\nour customers’ needs, as well as our own. We do not consolidate our customer securitization vehicles, certain capital vehicles, various BMO-managedfunds or various other SEs where investments are held. Further details on our customer securitization vehicles are provided below.\\nBMO-Sponsored Securitization Vehicles\\nWe sponsor various vehicles that fund assets originated either by us (which are then securitized through a bank securitization vehicle) or by ourcustomers (which are then securitized through three Canadian customer securitization vehicles and one U.S. customer securitization vehicle). We e arn\\nfees for providing services related to these customer securitization vehicles, including liquidity, distribution and financial arrangement fees for\\nsupporting the ongoing operations of the vehicles. These fees totalled approximately $160 million in fiscal 2024 ($149 million in fiscal 2023).\\nCustomer Securitization Vehicles\\nOur customer securitization vehicles provide customers with access to financing either from us or from the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP)markets. Customers sell either their assets or an interest in their assets into these vehicles, which then issue ABCP either to investors or to us, inorder to fund the purchases. The sellers remain responsible for servicing the transferred assets and are first to absorb any losses realized on thoseassets. We are not responsible for servicing or absorbing the first loss and none of the sellers are affiliated with BMO.\\nOur exposure to potential losses arises from the purchase of ABCP issued by the vehicles, any related derivative contracts entered into with the\\nvehicles, and the liquidity support provided to the market-funded vehicles. We use the credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enter intothese arrangements, just as we do when extending credit in the form of a loan.\\n66BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 55\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Three of these customer securitization vehicles are market-funded, while the fourth is funded directly by the bank. We do not control these\\nentities and therefore they are not consolidated. Further information on the consolidation of customer securitization vehicles is provided in Note 7o f\\nthe audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe market-funded vehicles had a total of $11.2 billion of ABCP outstanding as at October 31, 2024 ($12.2 billion as at October 31, 2023). The\\nABCP issued by the Canadian market-funded vehicles is rated R-1 (high) by DBRS and P1 by Moody’s, and the ABCP issued by the U.S. market-fundedvehicle is rated A1 by S&P and P1 by Moody’s. Our holdings of ABCP, as distributing agent of ABCP issued by the market-funded vehicles,totalled $170 million as at October 31, 2024 ($518 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nWe provide liquidity facilities to the market-funded vehicles, which may require that we provide additional financing to the vehicles should\\ncertain events occur. The total committed and undrawn amount under these liquidity facilities and the undrawn amount of the BMO funded vehiclesas at October 31, 2024 totalled $19.3 billion ($19.8 billion as at October 31, 2023). This amount comprises part of the commitments outlined inNote 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe assets of each of these market-funded vehicles consist primarily of exposures to diversified pools of automobile-related receivables and\\nconventional residential mortgages in Canada, and automobile-related receivables and equipment loans in the United States. These two asset classe s\\nrepresent 67% (63% in fiscal 2023) in Canada, and 86% (unchanged from 2023) in the United States, of the aggregate assets of their respectivevehicles as at October 31, 2024, and as at October 31, 2023, respectively.\\nGuarantees and Other Credit Instruments\\nTo meet the financial needs of our clients, we use a variety of guarantees and commitments. Guarantees include contracts under which we may berequired to make payments to a counterparty based on changes in the value of an asset, liability or equity security that the counterparty holds.Contracts under which we may be required to make payments if a third party does not perform according to the terms of a contract, and contractsunder which we provide indirect guarantees of indebtedness, are also considered guarantees. In the normal course of business, the types ofguarantee products we offer include letters of credit, derivatives contracts or instruments (including, but not limited to, credit default swaps), as well\\nas indemnification agreements. The maximum amount payable by BMO in relation to these guarantees was $47 billion as at October 31, 2024($40 billion as at October 31, 2023).\\nOther credit commitments are off-balance sheet arrangements that represent our commitment to customers to grant them credit in the form of\\nloans or other financings for specific amounts and maturities, subject to certain conditions. These include backstop liquidity facilities, docume ntary and\\ncommercial letters of credit, and commitments to extend credit. The maximum amount payable by BMO in relation to these other creditcommitments was $261 billion as at October 31, 2024 ($249 billion as at October 31, 2023).\\nThere is a large number of credit instruments outstanding at any time. The amount above is not representative of our likely credit exposure or\\nthe liquidity requirements for these instruments, as it does not take into account customer behaviour, which suggests that only a portion of ourcustomers would utilize the facilities related to these instruments, nor does it take into account any amounts that could be recovered under recourseand collateral provisions. Our customers are broadly diversified, and we do not anticipate events or conditions that would cause a significant numbe r\\nof customers to fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We use the credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enterinto these arrangements, just as we do when extending credit in the form of a loan. We monitor off-balance sheet credit instruments in order toavoid undue concentrations in any geographic region or industry.\\nFor the credit commitments outlined in the preceding paragraphs, in the absence of an event that triggers a default, early termination by BMO\\nmay result in a breach of contract.\\nFurther information on these instruments can be found in Note 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nCautionThis Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section contains forward-looking statements.

A disciplined and integratedapproach to managing risk is fundamental to the success of our operations. Our risk management framework providesindependent risk oversight across the enterprise and is integral to building competitive advantage.\\nEnterprise-Wide Risk Management outlines BMO’s approach to managing the key financial risks and other related risks that are inherent in these\\nbusiness activities, as discussed in the following sections:\\n68 Risks That May Affect Future Results\\n72 Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework77 Credit and Counterparty Risk85 Market Risk90 Insurance Risk91 Liquidity and Funding Risk100 Operational Non-Financial Risk\\n104 Legal and Regulatory Risk107 Strategic Risk107 Environmental and Social Risk109 Reputation Risk\\nText and tables presented in a blue-tinted font in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section of the MD&A form an integral part of the 2024 audited ann ual consolidated\\nfinancial statements. They present required disclosures as set out by the International Accounting Standards Board in IFRS 7, Financial Instruments – Disclosures, which\\npermits cross-referencing between the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the MD&A. Refer to Notes 1 and 5 of the audited annual consol idated financial\\nstatements.\\nRisks That May Affect Future Results\\nTop and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results\\nBMO’s overall risk profile can be impacted by evolving internal and external events. These events have the potential to affect our business and our\\noperational and financial results. Our risk management life cycle is a continuous process designed to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report o n\\nrisks arising from these events. These event-related risks are raised for discussion with the Board of Directors, senior management and businessleaders at several forums, incorporating both bottom-up and top-down approaches. Risks are examined and assessed by scenario analysis. Ourexposure to certain events is addressed through action plans developed based on these risk assessments.\\nThe following risks are considered to have the potential to materially impact BMO’s financial results, operational efficiency, strategic directio n\\nor reputation.\\nGeneral Economic Conditions\\nThe prevailing economic conditions in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business affect our financial results an d\\nbusiness operations. These conditions include the level of economic growth, interest rates and central bank actions, inflation, labour markets andunemployment rates, and the activity level and volatility of financial markets. The Canadian economy lost momentum in fiscal 2024, in response tohigher interest rates, but has shown continued resilience as a result of high levels of household savings, expansionary fiscal policies, and robustpopulation growth driven by immigration. Changes to Canada’s immigration policies are expected to slow population growth. Although the labourmarket has weakened in both countries, employment growth remains positive. Inflation has moderated, although some price pressures in theservices sector persist. The inflation rate has continued to moderate after reaching a four-decade high in fiscal 2022 in response to weaker labourmarkets, lower commodity prices and improved global supply chains. Policy rates are easing in Canada and the United States; however, longer-termborrowing costs, though falling, remain elevated. With the upcoming renegotiation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Trade Agreement in 2026,there is a risk that the free trade agreement may end, which could result in disruptive and costly tariffs on trade flows among the three nations.These factors represent risks for market stability and economic growth. Changes in economic conditions can affect consumer spending, housingprices, business investment and capital markets activity, and in turn, affect our business, including the demand for our lending and deposit product s,\\nnet interest income, fee revenue, operating expenses, credit losses and asset values. In fiscal 2024, the above factors had, and may continue to have,an impact on consumers and the operations of our clients, as well as a negative effect on our earnings, including lower loan and deposit demand, andhigher provisions for credit losses.\\nManagement regularly monitors the economic environment in which we operate, in order to identify significant changes in key economic\\nindicators, so that we can assess BMO’s portfolio and business strategies, and develop contingency plans to address any adverse developments.\\n68BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 57', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 6, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667311', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 57\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Cyber and Information Security Risk\\nCyber and information security risk arises from the ever-increasing reliance of our business operations on internet and cloud technologies, anddependence on advanced digital technologies to process data, combined with a hybrid work environment. In addition, rising geopolitical tensions ar e\\ncontributing to increasing global exposures to cyber security risks. These risks could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of BM O’s data\\nand information across our businesses and customer base. We are the target of attempted cyber attacks and must continuously monitor and developour systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure, as well as access to and the security of our data. Any resulti ng\\ndata breaches may lead to exposure or loss of data, including customer or employee information and the bank’s strategic or other sensitive internalinformation, and could result in identity theft, fraud or business losses. Cyber attacks could result in system failures and disruption of services, and\\nexpose the bank to litigation and regulatory risk, as well as reputational harm. Threat campaigns are becoming more sophisticated and well-organized, and often take place through third-party suppliers, which can negatively impact our business, brand and reputation, as well as customerretention and acquisition.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s cyber and information security program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nTechnology Resilience and Innovation Risk\\nTechnology resilience risk arises from a failure to maintain acceptable service levels during, as well as after, severe disruptions to critical proc esses\\nand the supporting information technology systems. Technology resilience risk exposure is increasing and driving new and more extensive regulator y\\nobligations and customer expectations related to operational resilience. This exposure challenges banks to extend their programs beyond disasterrecovery and business continuity activities, to include responses to internal and external threats of disruption. Technology resilience is critic al to\\nproviding our customers with a consistent online experience across our digital channels. Given the increasing reliance of our customers on technolo gy\\nplatforms to manage and support their personal, business and investment banking activities, it is important that we maintain platforms that functio n\\nat high levels of operational reliability and resilience, in order to protect and ensure the availability, integrity and recoverability of critical data,\\nparticularly with respect to business-critical systems.\\nTechnologies continue to evolve rapidly and are creating competitive pressures across the industry. Innovation risk is the inability to deliver new\\ntechnology solutions, services, processes and products that keep pace with rapidly evolving customer expectation and new competitors withoutdisruption to business-critical systems. New technologies may also lead to more complex regulatory, strategic and reputation risks. In alignment w ith\\nour Digital First strategy, we continue to invest in emerging technologies and talent to adapt to the dynamic environment and deliver competitiveand digitally-enabled products and services to meet our customers’ expectations for personalized and on-demand banking, pursue new businessgrowth opportunities and improve operational efficiency. We remain committed to the prudent and responsible adoption of new technologies.\\nIn alignment with BMO’s Digital First strategy, we continue to invest in risk management technology that can also enhance the customer\\nexperience, streamline processes and reduce complexity.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s technology risk program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nThird-Party Risk\\nOur use of third-party relationships continues to evolve and expand, helping us to deliver new and innovative solutions across the bank and for ourclients. While third-party relationships can be beneficial for the bank, they can give rise to risks that may threaten BMO’s operational resilience, such\\nas compromising customer data or disrupting the availability of critical products and services, which may financially impact the bank. We continue t o\\nenhance and evolve our capabilities in order to maintain effective third-party risk management and oversight and the efficient delivery of productsand services that depend on third parties.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s third-party risk program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nGeopolitical Risk and Escalating Trade Disputes\\nGeopolitical uncertainty and conflicts between countries impact global economies and may lead to market volatility. The Russia-Ukraine conflict h as\\nhad an ongoing global impact, including higher energy prices and the erosion of business confidence. The financial, energy and technology sanctionsimposed on Russia by Ukraine’s allies could lead to long-term political, economic and military turmoil between Western countries and Russia.\\nThe Middle East conflict has heightened tensions significantly in the region, and the potential for escalation could drive up energy prices, unsettl e\\nfinancial markets and slow global growth even further, which would have a direct and indirect impact on our customers.\\nCanadian and U.S. relations with China remain strained, involving trade disputes and tensions over Taiwan. The political climate in the United\\nStates could lead to a new wave of tariffs, and a U.S. commitment to expanding trade ties with Taiwan may further elevate the tension. In addition,the strategic competition between the United States and China is driving greater global fragmentation, as both countries seek to reinforce theirautonomy, limit any vulnerabilities and insulate their technology sectors. This could adversely affect business investment and prove especiallyproblematic for commodity-producing countries such as Canada that rely on a large export market. Ongoing Canada-China disputes over politicalinterference are further evidence of this discord.\\nDiplomatic relations between Canada and India have also deteriorated, which could threaten to disrupt trade flows, tourism and immigration\\nbetween the two countries.\\nWe actively monitor global and North American events and trends, and continually assess our businesses in the context of these events and\\ntrends. Although our lending portfolio has limited direct exposure outside North America, our customers rely on global trade and sustained economicgrowth. To mitigate exposure to geopolitical risk, we maintain a diversified portfolio that we continually monitor, in addition to contingency plan s\\nthat are intended to prepare BMO for possible adverse developments. Our portfolios, business plans and capital adequacy are stress tested againstseverely adverse scenarios arising from trade-related shocks, and we build contingency plans and mitigation strategies aimed at addressing andoffsetting the consequences of possible adverse political and economic developments.\\nBMO’s credit exposure by geographic region is set out in Tables 67 to 73 in the Supplemental Information and in Note 4 of the audited annual\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 69\\n\\n\\n## Page 58\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk, including Climate Change\\nBMO is exposed to environmental and social risks, in particular climate risk related to environmental conditions and extreme weather events thatcould potentially disrupt our operations, impact our customers and counterparties, and result in lower earnings or potential losses. Factors contr ibuting\\nto heightened environmental risks include the impacts of climate change and the continued intensification of development in areas of greaterenvironmental sensitivity. Business continuity and disaster recovery plans provide us with the roadmap and tools to support the restoration,maintenance and management of critical operations and processes in the event of a business disruption.\\nWe are also exposed to risks related to borrowers that may experience financial losses or rising operating costs as a result of acute or chronic\\nchanges in climate conditions, climate-related litigation and/or policies, such as carbon emissions pricing, or a decline in revenue as new andemerging technologies and changing consumer preferences disrupt or displace demand for certain commodities, products and services. BMO’s climateambition is to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world. Our strategy seeks to capture commercialization opportunities byworking with our clients on their decarbonization journeys.\\nLegal and regulatory risk or reputation risk could arise from actual or perceived actions, or inaction, by our operations and those of our customers\\nin relation to climate change and other environmental and social risk issues, or our disclosures related to these matters. Risks related to these issu es\\ncould also affect our customers, suppliers or other interested parties, which could give rise to new risks. Globally, new and more stringent climate-related obligations are being developed, which may increase compliance requirements. Litigation or enforcement measures could arise from theseobligations to manage and report on climate-related risks.\\nRefer to the Environmental and Social Risk section for further discussion of these risks.\\nCanadian Housing Market and Consumer Leverage\\nElevated household debt continues to be a headwind for household spending and broader economic activity. The combination of still restrictiveinterest rate policy that results in higher mortgage payments at renewal and rising unemployment could further increase credit losses, particularl yi n\\nunsecured consumer credit. While recent and expected rate reductions by the Bank of Canada are alleviating pressure on Canadian households, thehousing market recovery will likely be constrained by the persistent lack of affordability, notably in Ontario and British Columbia, which could lim it\\nmortgage origination volumes. The risk of credit losses in our mortgage portfolio is in part mitigated by low loan-to-value and prudent underwritingpractices that stress test customers’ ability to service mortgage debt at higher interest rates. While portfolio stress test analysis suggests that even\\nsignificant price declines and challenging economic conditions would result in manageable losses, primarily due to insurance coverage and thelevel of equity held by owners with seasoned loans, delinquencies and insolvencies in our portfolio could adversely affect our results andfinancial condition. In addition, consumer loan losses could rise if unexpected economic weakness results in a significant further increase in theunemployment rate.\\nRegulatory Environment and Changes\\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated, and BMO has experienced increasing complexity in regulatory requirements and expectations, a s\\ngovernments and regulators around the world continue to pursue major reforms intended to strengthen the stability of the financial system andprotect key markets and participants. These reforms may lead to further increases in regulatory capital or liquidity requirements and additionalcompliance costs, which could lower returns and affect growth. Such reforms could also affect the cost and availability of funding and the level of thebank’s market-making activities. Regulatory reforms may also impact fees and other revenues for certain operating groups. In addition, difference si n\\nthe laws and regulations enacted by a range of national regulatory authorities may offer advantages to our international competitors, which couldaffect our ability to compete. We monitor such developments, and other potential changes, so that we are well-positioned to respond and implementany necessary changes. BMO is subject to legal proceedings, including investigations by regulators. Failure to comply with applicable legal andregulatory requirements and expectations could result in further legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions and fines, enforceme nt\\nactions, criminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in invest or and\\ncustomer confidence, and damage to our reputation.\\nRefer to the Legal and Regulatory Risk section for further discussion of these risks.\\nOther Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nFiscal and Monetary Policies and Other Economic Conditions in the Countries in which BMO Conducts BusinessFiscal and monetary policies and other economic conditions prevailing in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do businessmay impact profitability and heighten economic uncertainty in specific businesses and markets, which may in turn affect our customers andcounterparties, reduce profitability and contribute to a greater risk of credit losses. Levels of business debt remain elevated due to the residual e ffects\\nof the pandemic and the loss of governmental supports, which could impact our markets and our operating results. Interest rate fluctuations couldhave an impact on our earnings, the value of our investments, the credit quality of our loans to customers and counterparty exposure, as well as thecapital markets that we access.\\nFluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to other currencies have affected, and could continue to affect, the business operations\\nand results of clients with significant earnings or input costs denominated in foreign currencies. Our investments in operations outside of Canada a re\\nprimarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and the foreign exchange impact on our U.S.-dollar-denominated risk-weighted assets and capital deduction s\\nmay result in variability in our capital ratios. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section for further discussion of these risks. The v alue\\nof the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar will also affect the contribution of U.S. operations to Canadian-dollar profitability.\\nHedging positions may be taken to manage interest rate exposures and foreign exchange impacts, and to partially offset the effects of Canadian\\ndollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations on the bank’s financial results.\\nRefer to the 2024 Financial Performance Review – Foreign Exchange section and the Market Risk section for a more complete discussion of our\\nexposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.\\n70BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 59\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Tax Legislation and Interpretations\\nLegislative changes and changes in tax policy, including their interpretation by tax authorities and the courts, may impact earnings. Tax laws, as we ll\\nas interpretations of tax laws and policy by tax authorities, may change as a result of efforts by the Canadian and U.S. federal governments, other G20governments and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to increase taxes, broaden the tax base globally and improvetax-related reporting. For example, in fiscal 2024, the Canadian government enacted legislation to adopt the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BaseErosion and Profit Shifting two-pillar plan (Pillar 2) for international tax reform, which will levy a 15% minimum tax on operations globally.\\nFor further discussion, refer to the Future Changes in Accounting Policies – IAS-12, Income Taxes section.\\nChanges to Business Portfolio\\nAs part of its overall business strategy, BMO may acquire companies, businesses and assets. Although we conduct thorough due diligence beforecompleting these acquisitions, some acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our financial or strategic objectives or expectations. We may b e\\nsubject to regulatory and shareholder approvals to successfully complete an acquisition, and it may not be feasible to establish when, if or on whatterms the necessary approvals will be granted. Changes in the competitive and economic environment, as well as other factors, may result in adecline in revenue or profitability, while higher than anticipated integration costs and failure to realize anticipated cost savings after an acqui sition\\ncould also adversely affect earnings. Integration costs may increase because of regulatory costs related to an acquisition, operational loss event s,\\nother unanticipated expenses that were not identified in the due diligence process or demands on management time that are more significant thananticipated, as well as unexpected delays in implementing certain plans that may, in turn, lead to delays in achieving full integration. Successful p ost-\\nacquisition performance depends on retaining the clients and key employees of acquired companies and businesses and on integrating key systemsand processes without disruption.\\nBMO also evaluates potential dispositions of assets and businesses that may no longer meet strategic and financial objectives. When we seek to\\nsell assets or dispose of a business, we may have difficulty obtaining buyers or devising alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timel y\\nmanner, which could delay the achievement of strategic objectives. We may also dispose of assets or a business on terms that are less favourablethan anticipated or lead to adverse operational or financial impacts, or greater disruption than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on reven ue\\ngrowth may be greater than forecast. Dispositions may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions and the granting of governmental or regulatoryapprovals on acceptable terms that, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent the completion of a disposition as intended, or at all.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Judgments and Accounting Standards\\nBMO prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Changes that the International Accounting Standards Board makes fromtime to time may materially affect the way we record and report financial results. Future changes in accounting policies are discussed in the FutureChanges in Accounting Policies section, as well as in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe application of IFRS requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and\\nliabilities, certain amounts reported in net income and other related disclosures. In making these judgments and estimates, we rely on the bestinformation available at the time. However, it is possible that circumstances may change, new information may become available or models mayprove to be imprecise.\\nBMO’s financial results could be affected for the period during which any such new information or change in circumstances becomes apparent,\\nand the extent of the impact could be significant. More information is included in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section.\\nCautionThe Risks That May Affect Future Results section and the remainder of this Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section contain forward-looking stateme nts.

Our Enterprise Risk and Portfolio\\nManagement (ERPM) group oversees the implementation and operation of the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework (ERMF), and providesindependent review and oversight across the enterprise on risk-related issues, in order to enable prudent and measured risk-taking that is integrat ed\\nwith business strategy. All elements of the ERMF function together to support informed and effective risk management, while striking an appropriatebalance between risk and return.\\nThe ERMF guides our risk-taking activities in order to align them with customer needs, shareholder expectations and regulatory requirements. We\\nhave established a risk governance framework as part of the ERMF that serves as the foundation for consistent and effective management of risksfacing the bank, outlining our approach to understanding and managing risk, protecting BMO’s reputation, diversifying and limiting potential tail risk,\\nmaintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, and optimizing risk return. In addition, the ERMF defines roles and responsibilities across al l three\\nlines of defence. It incorporates our Risk Management Life Cycle and informs our efforts to identify, assess, manage (which includes mitigation),monitor and report on our exposure to material risks. The ERMF is driven by our people, processes and technology, along with a range of riskmanagement tools, including modelling and analytics, stress testing and scenario analysis, and our Risk Taxonomy. All elements of the ERMF aresupported by our risk culture and provide for direct management of each individual risk type, as well as the management of risk on an integratedbasis.\\nRisk Management Tools\\n(e.g.: Stress Testing, Scenario Analysis, Modelling, Analytics)Enterprise Risk Management Framework\\nRisk Culture\\n\\x81 Tone from the top\\n\\x81 Accountability\\x81 Effective communication and challenge\\n\\x81 IncentivesRisk Management EnablementIDENTIFY ASSESS MANAGE MONITOR REPORT Risk Management Life Cycle\\nRisk Taxonomy \\x81 Credit & Counterparty\\n\\x81 Market\\x81 Liquidity & Funding\\n\\x81 Insurance\\x81 Non-Financial**\\n\\x81 Reputation\\x81\\n\\x81Risk Governance\\nBoard\\n(RRC*, ACRC*)\\nSenior Management\\n(RMC*, ERC* & Management Committees*)\\nRisk Appetite Framework\\nPolicy Framework\\n1st Line\\nOperating Groups, Technology &\\nOperations, Corporate Services2nd Line\\nEnterprise Risk & Portfolio Management,\\nLegal & Regulatory Compliance3rd Line\\nCorporate Audit \\nDivisionRisk Management Approach Maintain strong capital and liquidity Diversify; limit tail risk Optimize risk return Understand and manage Protect our reputation\\nPeople - Process - Technology\\nRisk Governance\\nThe ERMF outlines a governance approach that includes robust Board of Directors and senior management oversight, a Risk Appetite Framework, the\\nEnterprise Policy Framework and the corresponding roles in the three-lines-of-defence operating model.\\nBoard of Directors and Senior Management Oversight\\nSpecific policies approved by our Board of Directors govern our approach to the management of material risks, and oversight is exercised at everylevel of the enterprise through a hierarchy of committees and individual responsibilities, as outlined in the following diagram. The Board of Direct ors\\nseeks to ensure that corporate objectives are supported by a sound risk strategy, prudent risk appetite and an effective ERMF that is appropriate tothe nature, scale, complexity and risk profile of our lines of business and other operations. The Board also has overall responsibility for oversight of\\nthe bank’s governance framework and corporate culture. Senior management reviews and discusses significant risk issues and action plans as theyarise in the implementation of the enterprise-wide strategy, exercising oversight and governance of the risks taken across the enterprise and theprocesses through which exposures to such risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported on, in accordance with policies, and heldwithin approved limits and risk tolerances.\\nThe ERMF is reviewed on a regular basis by the Risk Review Committee (RRC) of the Board of Directors, in order to exercise oversight and guide\\nrisk-taking activities.\\n72BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 61\\n\\n                          MD&A                          \\n(2) Co-chaired by the Chief Finan cial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.\\n(3) Chaired by the Chief Risk Officer.\\n(4) Chaired by the General Counsel.(5) Co-chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.(6) Co-chaired by the General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.Board/BoardCommittees\\nManagement\\nCommitteesBoard & Senior Management Oversight (1)\\nBoard of Directors\\nRisk Review Committee\\n(RRC)Audit and Conduct Review\\nCommittee (ACRC)\\nRisk Management\\nCommittee (RMC) (3)Reputation Risk Management\\nCommittee (RRMC) (4)Asset Liability\\nCommittee (ALCO) (5)Enterprise Regulatory \\nCommittee (ERC) (6)Enterprise Capital\\nManagement\\nCommittee (ECMC) (2)\\n(1) Reporting relationships shown in dotted lines, sub-committees shown as solid lines.\\nIn addition to the oversight exercised by the Board of Directors and senior management, effective governance of the bank’s risks is overseen by\\nmanagement committees and supported by the three-lines-of-defence operating model, which addresses risks across the operating groups andCorporate Services.\\nBoard of Directors is responsible for supervising the management\\nof the business and affairs of BMO. The Board, either directly orthrough its committees, is responsible for oversight of the followingareas: strategic planning; defining risk appetite; identifying andmanaging risk; managing capital; fostering a culture of integrity;internal controls; succession planning and evaluation of seniormanagement; communication; public disclosure; and corporategovernance.\\nRisk Review Committee (RRC) of the Board of Directors assists the\\nBoard in fulfilling its risk management oversight responsibilities.This includes overseeing a strong risk culture; overseeing theidentification, assessment and management of BMO’s risks;monitoring adherence to risk management corporate policies andcompliance with risk-related regulatory requirements; and evaluatingthe effectiveness of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), in conjunction withthe Human Resources Committee, including input into successionplanning for the CRO. The ERMF is reviewed at least annually by theRRC, and guides risk-taking activities and sets out the bank’sapproach to risk management.\\nAudit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Board of\\nDirectors assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilitiesfor the integrity of BMO’s financial reporting and sustainabilityreporting, including the effectiveness of BMO’s internal controls; theinternal audit function; the qualifications, independence andperformance of the independent auditors; BMO’s compliance withlaws and regulations; transactions involving related parties; conflictsof interest and confidential information; standards of businessconduct and ethics; cyber security; and consumer protectionmeasures and complaints.\\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) is directly accountable to the Board for\\nall of BMO’s risk-taking activities. The CEO is supported by the CROand the ERPM group.Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports directly to the CEO, is head of ERPM,\\nchair of RMC and reports to the RRC on risk-related matters. The CROis responsible for providing independent review and oversight ofenterprise-wide risks and leadership on risk issues, developing andmaintaining the ERMF and fostering a strong risk culture across theenterprise.\\nManagement Level Committees overseeing risk matters, including\\nthe Enterprise Capital Management Committee (ECMC), RiskManagement Committee (RMC), Reputation Risk ManagementCommittee (RRMC), Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and EnterpriseRegulatory Committee (ERC), bring together senior executivemembers of BMO management to oversee risk management acrossthe enterprise. The committees are chaired by members of theExecutive Committee, exercising risk oversight and governance fortheir respective risks at the highest levels of management.\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM) , as the second\\nline of defence, provides risk management oversight, effectivechallenge and independent assessment of risk and risk-takingactivities. ERPM supports a disciplined approach to risk-taking byexercising its responsibility for independent transactional approvaland portfolio management, policy formulation, risk reporting, stresstesting, modelling and risk education. This approach promotesconsistency in risk management practices and standards across theenterprise, and verifies that any risks accepted are consistent withBMO’s risk appetite.\\nOperating Groups and Corporate Services , including Technology\\nand Operations, are responsible for effectively managing risks byidentifying, assessing, managing, monitoring, mitigating andreporting on exposures to risk within their respective operations andlines of business, in accordance with their established risk appetite.They exercise business judgment and maintain effective policies,processes and internal controls, so that significant risk issues areescalated and reviewed by ERPM.

This is guided by five key principles that define our approach to managing risk\\nacross the enterprise and comprise our Risk Appetite:\\n‰Understand and Manage by only taking risks that are transparent and understood.\\n‰Protect BMO’s Reputation by adhering to principles of honesty, integrity, respect and high ethical standards, in line with our Code of Conduct.\\n‰Diversify. Limit Tail Risk by targeting a business mix that minimizes earnings volatility and exposure to low-probability, high-impact events.\\n‰Maintain Strong Capital and Liquidity positions that meet, or exceed, regulatory requirements and market expectations.\\n‰Optimize Risk Return by managing risk-adjusted exposures and making decisions that create value for shareholders.\\nOur Risk Appetite Framework consists of a Risk Appetite Statement, risk limits and an outline of the responsibilities of the Board of Directors, its\\ncommittees and senior management. The Risk Appetite Statement incorporates a risk appetite, comprising both qualitative statements andquantitative measures (including risk limits), that indicates the aggregate level and types of risk that the bank is willing to assume in order to supp ort\\nsound business initiatives and drive appropriate returns and targeted growth. The risk appetite is integrated within our strategic and businessobjectives and our capital and liquidity plans, as well as the bank’s recovery and resolution plans. Our risk appetite is established by following theRisk Appetite Framework principles, supported by corporate policies, standards and guidelines, as well as committee mandates, and is developed tomeet regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. The Risk Appetite Framework assists senior management and the Board ofDirectors in assessing the bank’s risk profile against our risk appetite. Both the Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Appetite Statement are reviewedand approved by the Board of Directors annually. Our risk appetite is articulated and applied consistently across the enterprise, with operating gro ups,\\nkey businesses and entities developing their own respective risk appetite statements within this framework.\\nRisk Limits\\nRisk limits are set so that risk-taking activities remain within BMO’s risk appetite, balancing risk diversification, exposure to loss and risk-adj usted\\nreturns. These limits inform business strategies and decisions, and are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors or management or itscommittees, as appropriate, based on the level and granularity of the limits. They include:\\n‰Credit and Counterparty Risk – limits on group and single-name exposures and material country, industry and portfolio/product segments.\\n‰Market Risk – limits on economic value and earnings exposures to stress scenarios and significant market movements, as well as limits on value at\\nrisk and stress related to trading and underwriting activities.\\n‰Insurance Risk – limits on policy exposures and reinsurance arrangements.\\n‰Liquidity and Funding Risk – minimum limits governing the internal liquidity stress testing scenario, minimum regulatory liquidity ratio\\nrequirements, and maximum levels of asset pledging and wholesale funding, as well as limits related to liability diversification and exposure tocredit and liquidity facilities.\\n‰Operational Non-Financial Risk – key metrics for measuring operational and other non-financial risks that may have financial consequences.\\nThe Board of Directors, after considering recommendations from the RRC and RMC, annually reviews and approves key risk limits and then delegates\\noverall authority for these limits to the CEO. The CEO in turn delegates more specific authorities to the senior executives of the operating groups (fi rst\\nline of defence), who are responsible for the management of risk in their respective operations, and to the CRO. These delegated authorities allowrisk officers to set risk tolerances, approve geographic and industry sector exposure limits within defined parameters, and establish underwritin g and\\ninventory limits for trading and investment banking activities. The criteria under which more specific authorities may be delegated across theorganization, as well as the requirements relating to documentation, communication and monitoring of those specific delegated authorities, are se t\\nout in corporate policies and standards.\\nEnterprise Policy Framework\\nThe Enterprise Policy Framework includes a comprehensive set of risk-related corporate policies, each of which is approved by the RRC, ACRC or theBoard of Directors, as well as corporate standards issued pursuant to those corporate policies that have been reviewed by the RMC and approved bysenior management. Corporate policies and standards collectively outline the principles, expectations, and roles and responsibilities of seniormanagement for ensuring that exposures to key risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported. Corporate policies and standardsare reviewed and updated at a minimum every two years.\\nThe Enterprise Policy Framework also includes supporting directives and procedures that apply across the first and second lines of defence to\\noperationalize the requirements, roles and responsibilities, and frameworks outlined in those corporate policies and standards.\\n74BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 63', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 7, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667321', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 63\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Three-Lines-of-Defence Operating Model\\nOur ERMF is operationalized through the three-lines-of-defence approach to managing risk, as described below:\\n‰Operating groups and Corporate Services, which includes Technology and Operations, serve as our first line of defence. They are accountable for the\\nrisks arising from their businesses, operations and exposures. They are expected to pursue business opportunities within their established riskappetite and to identify, assess, manage (which includes mitigation), monitor and report on risks in, or arising from, their businesses, operationsand exposures. The first line fulfills its responsibilities by applying risk management and reporting methodologies, by establishing appropriateinternal controls in accordance with the ERMF, and by monitoring the effectiveness of such controls. These processes and controls serve as theframework for our lines of business to act within their delegated risk-taking authority and risk limits, as set out in corporate policies and the RiskAppetite Framework. Corporate Services, while part of our first line of defence, may also serve in a governance capacity when specific roles andresponsibilities are assigned to individuals or groups under the Enterprise Policy Framework. In such instances, governance accountabilities wil lb e\\ncarried out independent of the individuals or groups responsible for risk-taking.\\n‰The second line of defence comprises ERPM and Legal & Regulatory Compliance. The second line exercises independent oversight, performseffective challenge and provides independent assessment of risks and risk management practices, including transactions, product and portfolio ri sk\\nmanagement decisions, regulatory compliance, and processes and controls applied in the first line of defence. The second line establishesenterprise-wide risk management policies, frameworks, processes, methodologies and practices that the first and second lines use to identify,assess, manage (which includes mitigation), monitor and report on risks across the enterprise.\\n‰Corporate Audit Division is the third line of defence. It provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls across theenterprise, including controls that support the risk management and governance processes, and reports its findings to the Board of Directors.\\nRisk Taxonomy\\nOur Risk Taxonomy categorizes the key risks to which BMO is exposed and p rovides a framework for the risk management life cycle in relation to\\neach of the key risks. Our Risk Taxonomy incorporates exposures to financ ial risks (Credit and Counterparty Risk, Market Risk, Insurance Risk and\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk), non-financial risks (Operational Non-Finan cial Risk and Legal and Regulatory Risk) and transverse risks, which inter sect\\nwith both financial and non-financial risks (Strategic Risk, Environment al and Social Risk and Reputation Risk ). We maintain sub-categories under\\neach Tier 1 risk to support effective risk management practices as part of the overall ERMF. Failure in managing these risks, or in controlling our\\nexposures to them, could have material financial consequences for BMO.\\nRisk Management Life Cycle\\nRisk Identification, Assessment and ManagementRisk identification is an integral step in recognizing the key inherent risks that BMO faces, assessing the potential for loss and then acting to\\nmitigate this potential. Our Risk Taxonomy documents the key risks, suppo rting the implementation of our Risk Appetite Framework and assisting in\\nidentifying the primary risk categories for which stress capital consumpti on is estimated. Risk review and approval processes are established base d\\non the nature, size and complexity of the risks involved. Generally, t hese involve a formal review and approval by either an individual or a\\ncommittee that is independent of the originator. Delegated a uthorities and approvals by category are outlined below.\\n‰Portfolio transactions – transactions are approved through risk assessment processes for all types of transactions at all levels of the enterprise,\\nwhich include operating group recommendations and ERPM approval of credit risk, and transactional and position limits for market risk.\\n‰Structured transactions – new structured products and transactions with significant legal and regulatory, accounting or tax implications are\\nreviewed by the Global Markets Risk Committee, as appropriate, and are also assessed under the operational risk management process if theyinvolve structural or operational complexity that may give rise to significant operational risk. Transactions that may give rise to significant orheightened reputation risk are reviewed by the Reputation Risk Management Committee.\\n‰Investment initiatives – documentation of risk assessments is formalized through the investment assessment and approval process, and is\\nreviewed and approved by Corporate Services based on the size of an initiative’s investment spending and its inherent risk.\\n‰New products and services – policies and procedures for the approval of new or modified products and services offered to customers are the\\nresponsibility of both the first and second lines of defence, including appropriate senior business leaders, and are reviewed and approved bysubject matter experts and senior management in Corporate Services, as well as by other senior management committees.\\nRisk Monitoring and Reporting\\nRisk-Based Capital AssessmentTwo measures of risk-based capital are used by BMO: economic capital and regulatory capital. Both are aggregate measures of the risk that the bankassumes in pursuit of its financial objectives, and enable the evaluation of returns on a risk-adjusted basis. Our operating model provides for thedirect management of each type of risk, as well as the management of material risks on an integrated basis. Measuring the economic profitability oftransactions or portfolios involves a combination of both expected and unexpected losses to assess the extent and correlation of risk beforeauthorizing new exposures. Both expected and unexpected loss measures for a current transaction or portfolio reflect current and future marketconditions, the inherent risk in the position and, as appropriate, its credit quality. Risk-based capital methods and material models are reviewed a t\\nleast annually and updated as appropriate. The risk-based capital models provide a forward-looking estimate of the difference between themaximum potential loss in economic (or market) value and expected loss, measured over a specified time interval and using a defined confidencelevel.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 75\\n\\n\\n## Page 64\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nStress Testing\\nStress testing is a key element of our risk management and capital management frameworks. It is integrated into our enterprise and group riskappetite statements and embedded in our management processes. To evaluate risks, we regularly test a range of scenarios, which vary in frequency,severity and complexity, in portfolios and businesses across the enterprise. In addition, we participate in regulatory stress tests in multiplejurisdictions.\\nQuantitative models and tools, along with qualitative evaluations, are utilized to assess the impact of changes in the macroeconomic\\nenvironment on the income statement and balance sheet and the resilience of the bank’s capital position over a forecast horizon. Models utilized forstress testing are approved and governed under the Model Risk Management Framework, and are used to establish a better understanding of ourrisks and to test our capital adequacy.\\nBMO’s stress testing framework integrates stress testing at the line of business, portfolio, industry, geographic and product level, and embeds\\nthe test results in strategy, business planning and decision-making. Targeted portfolio, industry and geographic analysis is conducted by ERPM andthe lines of business to test risk appetite, limits, concentration and strategy. Ad hoc stress testing is conducted in response to changing economic o r\\nmarket conditions and in order to assess business strategies.\\nEnterprise stress testing is conducted to support BMO’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and target-setting through analysis\\nof the potential effects of low-frequency, high-severity events on our earnings, our balance sheet, and our liquidity and capital positions. Scenar io\\nselection is a multi-step process that considers material and idiosyncratic risks and the potential impact of new or emerging trends on risk profiles ,a s\\nwell as on the macroeconomic environment. Scenarios may be defined by senior management or regulators. The economic impacts are determinedby the Economics group, which distills the scenarios into macroeconomic and market variables that include, but are not limited to, GDP growth, yieldcurve estimates, unemployment rates, real estate prices, stock index growth and changes in corporate profits. These macroeconomic variables drivestress loss models, tools and qualitative assessments that are applied to determine estimated stress impacts. The scenarios are used by operating,risk and finance groups to assess a broad range of financial impacts that BMO could experience as a result of a specific stress, as well as in theordinary course of business, and extraordinary actions anticipated in response to that stress.\\nGovernance of the stress testing framework resides with senior management, including the Enterprise Stress Testing Committee. This committee\\ncomprises business, risk and finance executives, and is accountable for reviewing and challenging enterprise-wide scenarios and stress test resul ts.\\nStress testing and enterprise-wide scenarios associated with the ICAAP, including recommendations for actions that the enterprise could take in or der\\nto manage the impact of a stress event, are established by senior management and presented to the Board of Directors. Oversight and governance ofthe stress testing associated with the Horizontal Capital Review (HCR), which is a U.S. regulatory requirement for BMO Financial Corp. (BFC), areexercised at the BFC level by its Board of Directors through its Risk Oversight and Capital Committee.\\nRefer to the Environmental and Social Risk section for a discussion of our climate scenario analysis program.\\nRisk Culture\\nRisk culture at BMO is the set of shared norms, attitudes and behaviours rela ted to risk awareness, risk-taking and risk management. Sound risk cultur e\\nis designed to support appropriate behaviours and judgments about risk-ta king, and promotes effective risk management and the alignment of risk-\\ntaking activities with BMO’s Risk Appetite. Our risk culture informs and su pports our overall organizational culture. We are committed to high ethic al\\nstandards, grounded in our values of integrity, empathy, diversity and r esponsibility. ERPM is responsible for the development and promotion of a\\nhealthy, strong risk culture across the enterprise. In pursuing this manda te, ERPM works closely with Legal & Regulatory Compliance and its Ethics Of fice,\\nas well as People & Culture. BMO’s risk culture is founded on four guiding prin ciples that together reinforce its effectiveness across the bank: Tone f rom\\nthe Top, Accountability, Effective Communication and Challenge, and Incentives.\\n‰Tone from the Top: Our risk culture is grounded in an approach to risk management that encourages openness, constructive challenge and\\npersonal accountability. Each member of senior management plays a critical role in fostering this strong risk culture among employees byeffectively communicating this responsibility and by the example of their actions. The Board of Directors oversees BMO’s corporate objectives andthe requirement that they be supported by a sound risk strategy and an effective ERMF that is appropriate to the nature, scale, complexity and riskprofile of our operations.\\n‰Accountability: BMO’s ERMF is anchored in the three-lines-of-defence approach to managing risk. Our risk culture also encourages the escalation of\\nconcerns associated with potential or emerging risks to senior management, so that those concerns can be appropriately evaluated and addressed.BMO encourages and supports an environment in which concerns can be raised without retaliation.\\n‰Effective Communication and Challenge: Timely and transparent sharing of information is integral to engaging business partners in key decisions\\nand strategy discussions, which brings added rigour and discipline to BMO’s decision-making. This not only leads to the timely identification,escalation and resolution of issues, but also encourages open communication, independent challenge and an understanding of the key risks facedby the organization, so that employees are equipped and empowered to make decisions and take action in a coordinated and consistent manner,supported by a strong and effective monitoring and control framework.\\n‰Incentives: Compensation and other incentives are aligned with prudent risk-taking. These are designed to reward the appropriate use of capital\\nand respect for the rules and principles of the ERMF, and to discourage excessive risk-taking. Risk managers have input into the design of incentiveprograms that may have an effect on risk-taking. We also maintain training programs that are designed to foster a deep understanding of BMO’scapital management and risk management frameworks across the enterprise, providing employees and management with the tools and insightsthey need to fulfill their responsibilities for independent oversight, regardless of their role in the organization.\\n76BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 65\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Credit and Counterparty Risk\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk is the potential for financial loss due to the failure of an obligor (i.e., a borrower, endorser, guarantor or counterparty)\\nto repay a loan or honour another predetermined financial obligation.\\nCredit and counterparty risk underlies every lending activity that we enter into, and also arises in the holding of investment securities, transacti ons\\nrelated to trading and other capital markets products, and activities related to securitization. Credit and counterparty risk represents the mostsignificant measurable risk we face. Effective management of credit and counterparty risk is integral to our success, since failure to do so could hav e\\nan immediate and significant impact on our earnings, financial condition and reputation.\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk Governance\\nThe Credit Risk Management Framework seeks to ensure that material credit risks to which the enterprise is exposed are identified, assessed,managed, monitored and reported on regularly. The Risk Review Committee (RRC) has oversight of the management of material risks that BMO faces,including the Credit Risk Management Framework. The framework incorporates governing principles that are defined in a series of corporate policiesand standards and are given effect through specific operating procedures. These policies and standards are reviewed on a regular basis and modifiedas necessary, so that they are current and consistent with our risk appetite. The structure, limits (both notional and capital-based), collateralrequirements, monitoring, reporting and ongoing management of credit and counterparty exposures are governed by these credit risk managementprinciples.\\nLending officers in the operating groups are responsible for recommending credit decisions based on the completion of appropriate due\\ndiligence, and they assume accountability for the related risks. In some instances, relatively small transactions may be assessed by an automateddecision-making process, or they may be approved by first-line underwriters with appropriate training, independence and oversight. Credit office rs in\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM) approve larger transactions or transactions involving greater risk and are accountable for provid ing\\nan objective independent assessment of the relevant lending recommendations and risks assumed by the lending officers. All of these individuals inthe first and second lines of defence are subject to a lending qualification process and operate in a disciplined environment with clear delegation ofdecision-making authority, including individually delegated lending limits where appropriate, which are reviewed annually or more frequently, a s\\nneeded. The Board of Directors annually delegates to the CEO discretionary lending limits for further specific delegation to senior officers. Credi t\\ndecision-making is conducted at the management level based on the size and risk of each transaction, in accordance with a range of corporatepolicies, standards and procedures governing the conduct of activities in which credit risk arises. Corporate Audit Division reviews and testsmanagement processes and controls and samples credit transactions in order to assess adherence to acceptable lending standards as set out inBMO’s Risk Appetite Statement, as well as compliance with applicable corporate policies, standards and procedures.\\nFor wholesale borrowers presenting a higher than normal risk of default, we have formal policies in place that outline the framework for\\nmanaging such accounts, as well as specialized groups that manage them, as appropriate. We strive to identify borrowers facing financial difficultyearly, and to return such accounts to an acceptable level of risk through the application of good business judgment and the implementation of soundand constructive workout solutions.\\nAll credit risk exposures are subject to regular monitoring. Performing wholesale accounts are reviewed on a regular basis, generally no less\\nfrequently than annually, with most subject to internal monitoring of triggers that, if breached, result in an interim review. The frequency of revie w\\nrises in accordance with the likelihood and size of potential credit losses, and deteriorating higher-risk situations are referred to specialized a ccount\\nmanagement groups for closer attention, as appropriate. In addition, regular portfolio and sector reviews are conducted, including stress testing and\\nscenario analysis based on current, emerging or prospective risks. Reporting is provided at least quarterly, and more frequently where appropriate ,t o\\nthe Board of Directors and senior management committees in order to keep them informed of credit risk developments in our portfolios, includingchanges in credit risk concentrations, watchlist accounts, impaired loans, provisions for credit losses, negative credit migration and significa nt\\nemerging credit risk issues. This supports the RRC and senior management committees in any related decisions they may make.\\nCounterparty credit risk (CCR) involves a bilateral risk of loss because the market value of a transaction can be positive or negative for either\\ncounterparty. CCR exposures are subject to the credit oversight, limits, risk management framework and approval process outlined above. However,given the nature of the risk, CCR exposures are also monitored under the market risk framework. In order to reduce our exposure to CCR, transactionsare often collateralized and trades may be cleared through a regulated central counterparty (CCP), which reduces overall systemic risk by standingbetween counterparties, maximizing netting across trades and insulating counterparties from each other’s defaults. CCPs mitigate the risk of defa ult\\nby any member through margin requirements (both initial and variation) and a default management process, including a default fund and otherprovisions. Our exposures to CCPs are subject to the same credit risk governance, monitoring and rating framework we apply to all other corporateaccounts.\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk Management\\nCollateral ManagementCollateral is used for credit risk mitigation purposes in order to minimize losses that would otherwise be incurred in the event of a default. Dependin g\\non the type of borrower or counterparty, the assets available and the structure and term of the credit obligations, collateral can take various forms.For wholesale borrowers, collateral can take the form of pledges of the assets of a business, such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or rea l\\nestate, or personal assets pledged in support of guarantees. For trading counterparties, BMO may enter into legally enforceable netting agreementsfor on-balance sheet credit exposures, when possible. In the securities financing business (including repurchase agreements and securities lendi ng\\nagreements), we obtain eligible financial collateral that we control and can readily liquidate.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 77\\n\\n\\n## Page 66\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nCollateral for BMO’s derivatives trading counterparty exposures primarily comprises cash and eligible liquid securities that are monitored and\\nrevalued on a daily basis. Collateral is obtained under the contractual terms of standardized industry documentation.\\nWith limited exceptions, we utilize the Master Agreement provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc., frequently with a\\nCredit Support Annex, to document our collateralized trading relationships with counterparties for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are n ot\\ncentrally cleared.\\nA Credit Support Annex entitles a party to demand a transfer of collateral (or other credit support) when its exposure to OTC derivatives of the\\nother party exceeds an agreed threshold. Collateral to be transferred can include variation margin or initial and variation margin. Credit SupportAnnexes contain, among other measures, certain thresholds and provisions setting out acceptable types of collateral, a method for their valuation(discounts are often applied to market values), the availability of the collateral for re-pledging by the recipient and the manner in which interest i st o\\nbe calculated.\\nTo document our contractual securities financing relationships with counterparties, we utilize master repurchase agreements for repurchase\\ntransactions, and master securities lending agreements for securities lending transactions.\\nOn a periodic basis, collateral is subject to revaluation based on the specific asset type. For loans, the value of collateral is initially establishe da t\\nthe time of origination, and the frequency of revaluation is dependent on the type of collateral. For certain types of collateral that change frequent ly\\n(e.g., accounts receivable and inventory), monitoring consists of borrower reporting, covenants and/or triggers, as appropriate, to provide earl y\\nwarning signs of collateral value deterioration. Periodic inspections of physical collateral may be performed, where appropriate, taking intoconsideration collateral type, borrower risk profile and the feasibility of conducting such inspections. For commercial real estate collateral, a full\\nexternal appraisal of the property is typically obtained at the time of loan origination, unless the exposure is below a specified threshold amount, i n\\nwhich case an internal evaluation and a site inspection are conducted. Internal evaluations may consider property tax assessments, purchase prices ,\\nreal estate listings or realtor opinions. The case for an updated appraisal is reviewed annually, with consideration given to the borrower risk ratin g,\\nexisting tenants and lease contracts, as well as current market conditions.\\nIn the event a loan is classified as impaired, and depending on its size, a current external appraisal, valuation or restricted use appraisal is\\nobtained and updated every 12 months, or more frequently as appropriate, as long as the loan remains classified as impaired. In Canada, forresidential real estate that has an original loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than 80%, an independent property valuation is routinely obtained at t he\\ntime of loan origination. For U.S. residential loans secured by real estate, an independent property valuation is obtained for loans that will be reta ined\\nin BMO’s loan portfolio. For certain real estate loans originated for sale to government-sponsored agencies, the requirement may be waived based onan existing valuation already on file with that agency.\\nWe may use an external service provided by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) or an automated valuation model from a third-\\nparty appraisal management provider to assist in determining either the current value of a property or the need for a full property appraisal.\\nFor insured residential mortgages in Canada with an original LTV ratio greater than 80%, the default insurer is responsible for confirming the\\ncurrent value of the property.\\nPortfolio Management and Concentrations of Credit and Counterparty Risk\\nOur credit risk governance policies require an acceptable level of diversification, intended to ensure we avoid undue concentrations of credit risk .\\nConcentrations of credit risk may exist when a relatively large number of clients are engaged in similar activities, are located in the same geographi c\\nregion or have similar economic characteristics such that their ability to meet contractual obligations could be similarly affected by changes ineconomic, political or other conditions. Limits may be specified for several portfolio dimensions, including industry, specialty segments, count ry,\\nproduct and single-name concentrations. We use a range of tools to reduce the credit risk exposures in our loan portfolio. These include asset sales,traditional securitizations, or the purchase of credit protection in the form of credit default swaps or credit insurance and risk transfer transact ions.\\nCredit risk is mitigated by obtaining protection from better-rated counterparties or high-quality collateral. Credit risk mitigation activities support our\\nmanagement of capital, and individual and portfolio credit concentration.\\nOur credit assets consist of a well-diversified portfolio representing millions of clients, the majority of them individual consumers and small to\\nmedium-sized businesses. On a drawn loans and commitments basis, our most significant credit exposure at default as at October 31, 2024 was toindividual consumers, comprising $353,309 million ($344,912 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nCredit valuation adjustments (CVA) are fair value adjustments to capture counterparty credit risk in our derivative valuations. CVA profit and loss\\n(P&L) is recognized daily and provides a mitigant to the loss from a counterparty default by recognizing the expected credit loss given thecounterparty’s probability of default, as well as our credit exposure. The risks that arise from CVA are subject to our risk governance framework andare actively monitored by a business unit reporting to trading management that has been designated to manage CVA P&L for the bank. Markethedging is performed to manage CVA risks. This activity is subject to the bank’s risk control framework in order to manage the effectiveness ofhedges, and to provide independent review and oversight. The bank calculates CVA capital using both the standardized and basic approachmethodologies for CVA.\\nWrong-Way Risk\\nWrong-way risk occurs when our exposure to a counterparty increases at the same time that the credit quality of that counterparty deteriorates.Specific wrong-way risk arises when the credit quality of the counterparty and the market risk factors affecting collateral or other risk mitigantsdisplay a high correlation, and general wrong-way risk arises when the credit quality of the counterparty, for non-specific reasons, is highly corre lated\\nwith macroeconomic or other factors that affect the value of the risk mitigant. Our procedures require that specific wrong-way risk be identified intransactions and accounted for in the assessment of risk, including any heightened level of exposure.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\n78BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 67\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Credit and Counterparty Risk Measurement\\nBMO quantifies credit risk at both the individual borrower or counterparty level and the portfolio level. In order to limit earnings volatility, mana ge\\nexpected credit losses and minimize unexpected losses, credit risk is assessed and measured using the following risk-based parameters:\\n‰Exposure at Default (EAD) represents an estimate of the outstanding amount of a credit exposure at the time a default may occur.\\n‰Loss Given Default (LGD) is a measure of BMO’s economic loss, such as the amount that may not be recovered in the event of a default, presented\\nas a proportion of the exposure at default.\\n‰Probability of Default (PD) represents the likelihood that a borrower or counterparty will go into default over a one-year time horizon.\\n‰Expected Loss (EL) is a measure of the loss that BMO is expected to incur in the normal course of business in a given period of time. EL is\\ncalculated as a function of EAD, LGD and PD.\\nUnder Basel III, OSFI permits three approaches to the measurement of credit risk: Standardized, Foundation Internal Ratings Based (FIRB) and\\nAdvanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB). BMO primarily uses the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach, which includes both FIRB and AIRB, todetermine credit risk-weighted assets (RWA) in its portfolios, including portfolios of the bank’s subsidiary BMO Financial Corp. Under the Basel II I\\nReform requirement, it is mandatory to apply FIRB to a subset of IRB exposures where LGD and EAD are based on regulatory prescribed values. Referto the Supplementary Regulatory Capital Information disclosure for details regarding the total exposure (measured as EAD) of Retail and Wholesaleportfolios under the IRB Approach to determining regulatory capital. The remaining exposures reflect waivers and exemptions to the IRB Approachand are measured under the Standardized Approach, subject to OSFI’s approval. We continue to transition all material exposures in this category tothe IRB Approach. For securitization exposures, we apply the Basel hierarchy of approaches, including the Securitization Internal Ratings BasedApproach and the External Ratings Based Approach, as well as the Standardized Approach.\\nBMO’s regulatory capital and economic capital frameworks both use EAD to assess credit and counterparty risk. Capital is calculated based on\\nexposures that, where applicable, have been redistributed to a more favourable PD band or LGD measure, or a different Basel asset class, as a resultof the application of credit risk mitigation and a consideration of credit risk mitigants, including collateral and netting.\\nTotal credit exposures at default by type and industry sector, as at October 31, 2024 and 2023, based on the Basel III classifications, are disclosed in\\nthe table below.\\nTABLE 34\\n(Canadian $ in millions) Drawn (3) (7)Commitments\\n(undrawn) (3) (8)Other off-balance\\nsheet items (3) (9) OTC derivatives (4) (10)Repo-style\\ntransactions (4) (5) (11) Total (1)\\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\\nIndividual 287,741 281,087 65,568 63,812 – 13 – – – – 353,309 344,912\\nFinancial institutions 105,378 95,366 20,484 18,690 7,447 7,201 27,393 19,307 17,712 16,177 178,414 156,741\\nGovernments 230,353 219,795 3,024 2,551 1,760 1,575 4,481 8,193 1,070 5,870 240,688 237,984\\nManufacturing 33,561 33,046 15,555 16,059 1,696 1,915 1,049 807 – – 51,861 51,827\\nReal estate 66,650 61,734 8,632 11,843 1,234 971 412 224 – – 76,928 74,772\\nRetail trade 30,595 27,825 4,262 4,621 645 441 152 129 – – 35,654 33,016\\nService industries 54,433 56,588 13,830 13,552 3,192 3,172 990 696 – – 72,445 74,008\\nWholesale trade 21,868 19,997 7,212 7,618 670 611 268 167 – – 30,018 28,393\\nOil and gas 3,180 3,335 3,010 2,889 623 788 610 1,444 – – 7,423 8,456\\nUtilities 10,068 11,101 9,304 8,767 3,799 4,547 2,444 1,850 – – 25,615 26,265\\nOthers (2) 54,173 63,210 19,247 18,132 4,343 4,009 2,306 1,634 – – 80,069 86,985\\nTotal exposure at\\ndefault (6) 898,000 873,084 170,128 168,534 25,409 25,243 40,105 34,451 18,782 22,047 1,152,424 1,123,359\\n(1) Credit exposure excluding equity, securitization and other assets, such as non-significant investments, goodwill, deferred tax assets and int angibles.\\n(2) Includes remaining industries that individually comprise less than 2% of total exposures.(3) Represents gross credit exposures without accounting for collateral.(4) Credit exposure at default is inclusive of collateral.(5) Repo-style transactions include repos, reverse repos and securities lending transactions, which represent both asset and liability exposures .

Adjudication models, behavioural scorecards, decision tree s and expert knowledge are combined to generate optimal credit decisions in a\\ncentralized and automated environment.\\nThe retail risk rating system assesses risk based on individual loan characteristics. We have a range of internally developed PD, LGD and EAD\\nmodels for each of the major retail portfolios. The principle product lines within each of the retail portfolios are modelled separately, so that the r isk-\\nbased parameters capture the distinct nature of each product. The models, in general, are based on internal historical data recorded over a multi-yea r\\nperiod that includes at least one full economic cycle, in compliance with regulatory requirements. Adjustments are incorporated into the parameter s,\\nas appropriate, to account for uncertainties. The retail parameters are tested and calibrated on an annual basis, if required, to incorporate additi onal\\ndata points and recent experience in the parameter estimation process. Risk drivers used in the retail credit models may include customer attributes\\nsuch as delinquency status and credit scores, and account attributes such as loan amounts and utilization.\\n‰APD estimate is assigned to each homogeneous pool to reflect the long-run average of one-year default rates over the economic cycle.\\n‰AnLGD estimate is calculated by discounting future recovery payments to the time of default, including collection costs.\\n‰AnEAD estimate is calculated as the balance at default divided by the credit limit at the beginning of the year. For non-revolving products, such as\\nmortgages, EAD is equal to 100% of the current outstanding balance and has no undrawn component.\\nFor capital purposes, the LGD and EAD estimates are calibrated to reflect downturn conditions. The PD, LGD and EAD estimates are updated annuallyand recalibrated as required by comparing the estimates to observed historical experience.\\nRetail Credit Probability of Default Bands by Risk RatingTABLE 35\\nRisk profile Probability of default band\\nExceptionally low ≤0.05%\\nVery low > 0.05% to 0.20%Low > 0.20% to 0.75%Medium > 0.75% to 7.00%High > 7.00% to 99.99%Default 100%\\nWholesale (Sovereign, Bank, Corporate and Commercial)\\nWithin our wholesale portfolios, an enterprise-wide risk rating framework is applied to all sovereign, bank, corporate and commercial counterpart ies.\\nOne key element of this framework is the assignment of appropriate borrower or counterparty risk ratings (BRRs). We have a range of internallydeveloped general and sector-specific BRR models, as well as portfolio-level LGD and EAD models.\\nThe BRR models capture the key financial and non-financial characteristics of the borrowers and generate a borrower-level rating that reflects the\\nrelative ranking of the default risk. The models are primarily based on internal data, supplemented by judgment as necessary, for low-defaultportfolios.\\nBRRs are assessed and assigned at the time of loan origination, and reassessed when borrowers request changes to credit facilities or when\\nevents trigger a review, such as an external rating change or a covenant breach. BRRs are typically reviewed no less frequently than annually, andmore frequent reviews are conducted for borrowers with less acceptable risk ratings. The assigned ratings are mapped to a PD reflecting the\\nlikelihood of default over a one-year time horizon. As a borrower migrates between risk ratings, the PD associated with the borrower also changes.\\nWe employ a master scale with 14 BRRs above default, and PDs are assigned to each rating within an asset class to reflect the long-run average\\nof one-year default rates over an economic cycle, supplemented by external benchmarking, as necessary.\\nAn LGD estimate captures the priority of claim, collateral, product and sector characteristics of the credit facility extended to a borrower. LGD\\nestimates are at the facility level.\\nAn EAD estimate captures the facility type, sector and utilization rate characteristics of the credit facility extended to a borrower. EAD estimates\\nare at the facility level. An EAD credit conversion factor is calculated for eligible facilities by comparing amounts drawn at the time of default and o ne\\nyear prior to default.\\nLGD and EAD models have been developed using internal data recorded over a multi-year period that includes at least one full economic cycle, in\\ncompliance with regulatory requirements.

CRE primarily refers to two distinct types of real estate businesses: income-producing real estate(office, industrial and retail space, and multi-family residential buildings with more than four dwelling units), including the construction of th ese\\nassets; and development of land and construction of properties for sale (subdivisions, condominiums and other types of property). Our primary focusis income-producing commercial real estate portfolios with stable operating performance, diversified portfolios, modest leverage and continuedaccess to capital, including those legally structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate investment funds and real estate operat ing\\ncompanies (REOCs), as well as pension funds and other established owners of income-producing commercial real estate.\\nOur CRE portfolio was $75.4 billion as at October 31, 2024 ($69.7 billion as at October 31, 2023) and accounted for 11% of total gross loans and\\nacceptances (10% as at October 31, 2023). The portfolio is well-managed, with consistent and conservative underwriting standards, strict lendingcriteria and structural resilience. As at October 31, 2024, impaired loans represented 1% of the portfolio (1% as at October 31, 2023).\\nOur CRE portfolio is well-diversified across businesses, property types and geographic regions. Given the widespread adoption of remote and\\nhybrid work arrangements, office space is one of the higher-risk portfolio segments within commercial real estate. Office CRE was $7.7 billion as atOctober 31, 2024, including $5.5 billion in the United States ($8.3 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, as at October 31, 2023). In addition tomonitoring the limits we set for the CRE portfolio, we apply lower limits on each segment, including office space, which helps us mitigate exposure torelated risks.\\nReal Estate Secured Lending\\nReal estate secured lending comprises residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) we extend to individuals, secured byresidential real estate, which is defined as residential structures with one to four dwelling units. The increases in prime interest rates duringfiscal 2022 and 2023 impacted variable-rate mortgages, resulting in extended and negative amortization. Customer actions and decreases in interes t\\nrates in fiscal 2024 have reduced extended and negative amortization compared with the prior year. These prime rate increases had no immediateimpact on fixed-rate mortgages, which are fixed at one rate until renewal.\\nWe regularly perform stress testing on our residential mortgage and HELOC portfolios to assess the potential effects of high-impact events. These\\nstress tests incorporate scenarios ranging from moderately to severely adverse. The credit losses forecast in these tests vary with the severity of t he\\nscenario and are currently considered to be manageable.\\nThe following tables provide a breakdown of residential mortgages and HELOCs by geographic region, as well as insured and uninsured balances.\\nResidential mortgages and HELOCs are secured by residential properties.\\nCanadian Real Estate Secured LendingTABLE 37\\n(Canadian $ in millions)Residential\\nmortgages (1)Amortizing\\nhome equity\\nlines of creditTotal amortizing\\nreal estate\\nsecured lendingNon-amortizing\\nreal estate\\nsecured lendingTotal Canadian\\nreal estate\\nsecured lending\\nAs at October 31, 2024 158,910 36,326 195,236 13,614 208,850\\nAs at October 31, 2023 150,575 35,741 186,316 12,982 199,298\\n(1) Residential mortgage balances in prior periods included certain insured multi-unit residential mortgages subsequently reclassified as comme rcial real estate ($1.6 billion as at October 31, 2023).\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 81\\n\\n\\n## Page 70\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nResidential Mortgages(1)\\nTABLE 38\\nAs at October 31, 2024 As at October 31, 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted) Outstanding balancesFor the 12 months\\nended Outstanding balancesFor the 12 months\\nended\\nRegion (2) Insured (3) Uninsured Total % of totalAverage LTV\\nuninsured (4) Insured (3) Uninsured Total % of totalAverage LTV\\nuninsured (4)\\nAtlantic 3,261 3,802 7,063 3.7% 70% 3,347 3,452 6,799 3.8% 71%\\nQuebec 8,811 13,647 22,458 11.8% 71% 9,242 12,903 22,145 12.5% 71%\\nOntario 14,199 64,107 78,306 41.0% 70% 14,643 56,798 71,441 40.3% 70%\\nAlberta 9,551 8,175 17,726 9.3% 73% 9,885 7,302 17,187 9.7% 73%\\nBritish Columbia 4,504 25,011 29,515 15.4% 68% 4,746 24,391 29,137 16.5% 67%\\nAll other Canada 2,180 1,662 3,842 2.0% 72% 2,264 1,602 3,866 2.2% 73%\\nTotal Canada 42,506 116,404 158,910 83.2% 70% 44,127 106,448 150,575 85.0% 70%\\nUnited States 67 32,103 32,170 16.8% 76% 68 26,607 26,675 15.0% 77%\\nTotal 42,573 148,507 191,080 100% 71% 44,195 133,055 177,250 100% 71%\\n(1) Reporting methodologies are in accordance with OSFI’s Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and Procedures (B-20) Guideline.\\n(2) Region is based upon address of the property mortgaged.(3) Insured mortgages are defined as mortgages that are insured individually or in bulk through an eligible insurer (i.e., CMHC, Sagen MI Canada TM).\\n(4) Loan-to-value (LTV) is based on original outstanding balances for mortgages and authorized amounts for HELOCs, divided by the value of the collat eral at point of origination.\\nHome Equity Lines of Credit(1)\\nTABLE 39\\nAs at October 31, 2024 As at October 31, 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted) PortfolioFor the 12 months\\nended PortfolioFor the 12 months\\nended\\nRegion (2)Outstanding\\nbalances % Authorizations % Average LTV (4)Outstanding\\nbalances % Authorizations % Average LTV (4)\\nAtlantic 1,051 1.9% 2,028 1.7% 62% 996 1.8% 1,922 1.7% 60%\\nQuebec 9,216 16.3% 18,530 15.9% 68% 9,149 16.6% 18,071 15.9% 67%\\nOntario 25,313 44.8% 47,222 40.6% 60% 24,601 44.6% 45,351 40.0% 59%\\nAlberta 3,200 5.7% 7,156 6.1% 61% 3,203 5.8% 6,970 6.2% 62%\\nBritish Columbia 10,432 18.5% 19,867 17.1% 59% 10,029 18.2% 18,899 16.7% 59%\\nAll other Canada 728 1.3% 1,485 1.3% 65% 745 1.3% 1,474 1.3% 66%\\nTotal Canada 49,940 88.5% 96,288 82.7% 61% 48,723 88.3% 92,687 81.8% 61%\\nUnited States 6,497 11.5% 20,146 17.3% 59% 6,471 11.7% 20,615 18.2% 60%\\nTotal 56,437 100% 116,434 100% 61% 55,194 100% 113,302 100% 61%\\nRefer to footnote references in the Residential Mortgages table above.\\nResidential Mortgages by Remaining Term of Amortization(1) (2)\\nTABLE 40\\nAmortization period\\nAs at October 31, 2024 < 5 years 6-10 years 11-15 years 16-20 years 21-25 years 26-30 years 31-35 years > 35 years\\nCanada (3) 0.7% 2.6% 6.6% 16.1% 33.8% 26.5% 3.6% 10.1%\\nUnited States (4) 0.4% 1.7% 4.0% 2.4% 9.0% 82.3% 0.1% 0.1%\\nTotal 0.6% 2.5% 6.2% 13.8% 29.6% 35.9% 3.0% 8.4%\\nAmortization period\\nAs at October 31, 2023 < 5 years 6-10 years 11-15 years 16-20 years 21-25 years 26-30 years 31-35 years > 35 years\\nCanada (3) 0.7% 2.5% 6.1% 13.6% 32.1% 18.0% 2.1% 24.9%\\nUnited States (4) 0.5% 2.2% 5.3% 2.8% 10.4% 78.6% 0.1% 0.1%\\nTotal 0.7% 2.5% 5.9% 12.0% 28.8% 27.1% 1.8% 21.2%\\n(1) In Canada, the remaining amortization is based on the current balance, in terest rate, customer payment amount and payment frequency.

We manage loans through a credit risk framework, which includes structural elements, limits and risk mitigation. As atOctober 31, 2024, total leveraged loans outstanding, gross of risk mitigation, were $31.9 billion and represented 2% of total assets ($29.5 billionand 2%, respectively, as at October 31, 2023), of which $10.0 billion or 31% outstanding ($9.4 billion or 32% as at October 31, 2023) represented alower level of credit risk due to high-quality collateral assets, including asset-based lending and real estate. The remainder of the portfolio is we ll-\\ndiversified across sectors and includes loans to borrowers where we have relatively small hold sizes. As at October 31, 2024, $1.3 billion or 4% of allleveraged finance loans were classified as impaired ($589 million or 2% as at October 31, 2023). This portfolio is closely managed by specializedteams and within a limit structure. In addition to originating leveraged finance loans, we also underwrite leveraged finance loans, which is managedthrough the market risk framework.\\n(1) Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.\\n82BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 71\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Gross Impaired Loans\\nTotal gross impaired loans and acceptances (GIL) were $5,843 million, an increase from $3,960 million in the prior year.

We maintain both an allowance for credit losses on impaired loans and an allowance for credit losses onperforming loans, in accordance with IFRS. An allowance on performing loans is maintained to cover impairment in the existing portfolio for loansthat have not yet been individually identified as impaired. Our approach to establishing and maintaining the allowance on performing loans is basedon the requirements of IFRS, considering the guideline issued by our regulator, OSFI. Under the IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) expected credit\\nloss (ECL) methodology, an allowance is recorded for ECL on financial assets regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. We recognizean allowance for loss at an amount generally based on 12 months of ECL, if the credit risk at the reporting date has not increased significantly sinceinitial recognition (Stage 1). We record ECL over the remaining life of performing financial assets that are considered to have experienced a signifi cant\\nincrease in credit risk (Stage 2).\\nAn allowance on impaired loans is maintained to reduce the carrying value of individually identified impaired loans (Stage 3) to the expected\\nrecoverable amount.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) at a level that we consider appropriate to absorb credit-related losses. As at October 31, 2024,\\nthe total ACL was $4,936 million, an increase of $669 million from the prior year, reflecting higher allowances on both performing and impaired loans.The allowance on impaired loans was $731 million as at October 31, 2024, and the allowance on performing loans was $4,205 million. Theseamounts included an allowance on impaired loans of $78 million and an allowance on performing loans of $502 million, related to undrawncommitments and letters of credit that are considered other credit instruments and recorded in other liabilities. The allowance on impaired loansincreased $36 million from $695 million in the prior year. The allowance on performing loans increased $633 million from $3,572 million in the prioryear, primarily driven by portfolio credit migration, uncertainty in credit conditions and model updates, partially offset by improvement in themacroeconomic outlook, including the adoption of a fourth economic scenario, and the impact of the sale of a portfolio of recreational vehicle loans.\\nFurther details on the key assumptions used in the measurement of ACL can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section;\\ncontinuity in ACL by each product type can be found in Tables 71 and 72 in the Supplemental Information and in Note 4 of the audited annualconsolidated financial statements.\\nInternational Exposures\\nBMO’s geographic exposures to regions outside of Canada and the United States are subject to a risk management framework that incorporatesassessments of economic and political risks in each region or country. These exposures are also managed within limits based on product, entity andcountry of ultimate risk. Our total net exposure to these regions is set out in the table below.\\nThe table outlines total net exposure for funded lending and undrawn commitments, securities (including cash products, traded credit and credit\\ndefault swap activity), repo-style transactions and derivatives.

In addition, all businesses and individuals authorized to conduct trading and underwriting activities on behalf of\\nBMO are required to work within our governance framework and, as part of their first-line-of-defence responsibilities, they must adhere to allrelevant corporate policies, standards and procedures, and maintain and manage market risk exposures within specified limits and risk tolerances.In support of our risk governance framework, our market risk management framework comprises processes, infrastructure and supportingdocumentation which together support the identification, assessment, independent monitoring and control of our market risk exposures.\\nTrading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nOur trading and underwriting businesses give rise to market risk associated with buying and selling financial products in the course of meeting ourcustomers’ needs, such as market-making and related financing activities, and assisting clients to raise funds by way of securities issuance.\\nIdentification and Assessment of Trading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nAs the first step in the management of market risk, rigorous assessment processes are in place to identify market risk exposures associated with bothnew products and the evolving risk profile of existing products, including on- and off-balance sheet positions, trading and non-trading positions,leveraged loan, bond and equity underwriting, and market risk exposures arising from the domestic and foreign operations of our operating groups.\\nVarious metrics and techniques are then employed to measure identified market risk exposures. These include Value-at-Risk and stress tests, as\\nwell as sensitivity to market risk factors and position concentrations. Results are reported to the appropriate line of business, the RMC and RRC on aregular basis.\\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) measures the maximum loss likely to be experienced in the trading and underwriting portfolios, measured at a 99%\\nconfidence level over a one-day holding period. It incorporates the risk to the value of the bank’s trading and underwriting portfolios fromchanges in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices and their implied volatilities and correlations.\\nAlthough it is a useful indicator of risk, VaR has limitations, as with any model-driven metric. It assumes that all portfolio positions can be\\nliquidated within one day and that historical data can be used as a proxy to forecast future market events. In addition, VaR calculations are basedon portfolio positions at the close of business and do not reflect the impact of intra-day activity.\\nStress Tests are used to determine the potential impact of low-frequency, high-severity events on the trading and underwriting portfolios.\\nThe portfolios are measured daily against a variety of hypothetical and historical event scenarios, including the 2008 global financial crisis and t he\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, along with portfolio-specific impacts and asset class scenarios. Scenarios are continuously refined to reflect the latest mark et\\nconditions and portfolio risk exposures. Market liquidity horizons are reviewed for suitability and scenarios updated where appropriate. In addit ion,\\na range of assumptions, including the duration of the scenario and management actions, are incorporated in the stress tests to better reflect theanticipated impact on the trading and underwriting business.\\nVaR and stress testing metrics should not be viewed as definitive predictors of the maximum amount of losses that could be experienced in the\\ntrading and underwriting portfolios in any one day, as their results are based on models and estimates and are subject to confidence levels, and theestimates could be exceeded under unforeseen market conditions.\\nOur VaR model is back-tested on a daily basis, assuming there are no changes to the previous day’s closing position, and isolates the effects of\\neach day’s price movements against those closing positions. The one-day 99% confidence level VaR at the local and consolidated BMO levels iscompared with the estimated daily profit and loss (P&L) that would be recorded if the portfolio composition remained unchanged. If this P&L result isnegative and its absolute value is greater than the previous day’s VaR, a back-testing exception occurs. Each exception is investigated, explained a nd\\ndocumented.\\nModels support the measurement of our exposure to the risk of adverse outcomes for income, retained earnings and capital. We use a variety of\\nmethods to verify the integrity of our risk models, including the application of back-testing against hypothetical losses and approval by anindependent model validation team. The data and correlations that underpin our models are updated frequently, so that risk metrics reflect currentmarket conditions.\\nMarket Risk RWA is calculated using a standardized approach under Basel III for trading book activities along with foreign exchange risk in the\\nbanking book. Policies defining the activities eligible for trading book capital treatment and banking book capital treatment are used to delineatein-scope activity. Exceptions to general assumptions about trading and banking book categories are reported to OSFI. Such exceptions principally a rise\\nfrom instruments that are designated as trading under IFRS but used to hedge banking book market risks, along with deferred compensation planhedging. The fair value of instruments under exception is $1,459 million net liability and $11,571 million gross.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 85\\n\\n\\n## Page 74\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nMonitoring and Control of Trading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nLimits are set for our trading and underwriting activities, and are subject to regular monitoring and reporting.

In addition to the limits approved by our Board of Directors on earnings at risk and the sensitivityof economic value to changes in interest rates, more granular management limits are in place to guide the daily management of this risk.\\nThe RRC oversees structural market risk management, regularly reviews structural market risk positions and annually approves the\\nstructural market risk plan and limits. The RMC and Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) provide ongoing senior management oversight of risk positionsand related activities.\\nStructural Market Risk Measurement\\nInterest Rate RiskStructural interest rate risk arises when changes in interest rates affect the market value, cash flows and earnings of assets and liabilities relate d\\nto our banking activities. The objective of structural interest rate risk management is to maintain high-quality earnings and maximize sustainableproduct spreads, while managing risk to the economic value of our net assets arising from changes in interest rates.\\nStructural interest rate risk primarily comprises interest rate mismatch risk and product-embedded option risk.Interest rate mismatch risk arises when there are differences in the scheduled maturities, repricing dates or reference rates of assets, liabilitie s\\nand derivatives. The net interest rate mismatch, representing residual assets funded by common shareholders’ equity, is managed to align with atarget maturity profile through interest rate swaps and securities.\\nProduct-embedded option risk arises when product features allow customers to alter the timing of cash flows, such as scheduled maturity or\\nrepricing dates, usually in response to changes in market conditions. Product-embedded options include loan prepayments, deposit redemptionprivileges and committed rates on unadvanced mortgages. Product-embedded options and associated customer behaviour are captured in riskmodelling, and hedging programs may be used to limit the level of exposure to this risk.\\nStructural interest rate risk is measured using simulations, analyses of the sensitivity of earnings and economic value, stress testing and gap\\nanalysis, in addition to other risk metrics.\\nEarnings Sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the projected 12-month pre-tax net income from a portfolio\\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions in response to presc ribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at z ero.\\nEconomic Value Sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the market value of a portfolio of assets, liabilities\\nand off-balance sheet positions in response to prescribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at zero.\\nThe models that measure structural interest rate risk incorporate project ed changes in interest rates and predi ct the likely reaction of our custome rs to\\nthese changes. For customer loans and deposits with scheduled maturit y and repricing dates (such as mortgages and term deposits), the models\\nmeasure the extent to which customers are likely to use embedded options to alter those scheduled dates and timing. For customer loans and deposits\\nwithout scheduled maturity and repricing dates (such as credit card loans a nd chequing accounts), exposure is measured using models that adjust for\\nelasticity in product pricing and reflect historical and forecasted trend s in balances. The results generated by these structural market risk model sa r e\\ninherently uncertain, as they reflect potential future pricing and custom er behaviour, which may differ from actual experience. These models have b een\\ndeveloped using statistical analysis and are independently validated an d periodically updated through regula r model performance assessment, bac k-\\ntesting and ongoing dialogue with the lines of busi ness. Models developed to predict customer beha viour are also used to support product pricing.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 87\\n\\n\\n## Page 76\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAll models are subject to BMO’s Model Risk Management Framework, which is described in more detail in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management\\nFramework section.\\nThe sensitivity of structural interest rate earnings and economic value to an immediate parallel increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the\\nyield curve is disclosed in the table below.\\nThe sensitivity of structural economic value to rising interest rates primarily reflects a lower market value for fixed-rate loans. The sensitivity of\\nstructural economic value to falling interest rates primarily reflects the impact of a higher market value for fixed-rate loans and minimum modelledclient deposit rates. The exposure of structural economic value to rising interest rates and the benefits of falling interest rates decreased relati ve to\\nOctober 31, 2023, primarily due to modelled deposit pricing being less rate sensitive at lower projected interest rate levels following the decrease in\\nterm market rates during the year. Structural earnings sensitivity quantifies the potential impact of interest rate changes on structural balance s heet\\npre-tax net income over the next 12 months. The sensitivity of structural earnings to falling interest rates primarily reflects the risk of fixed-rat e and\\nfloating-rate loans repricing at lower rates and the more limited ability to reduce deposit pricing as rates fall. The benefits of rising interest rat es to\\nstructural earnings primarily reflect the positive impact of reinvesting our net equity and non-rate sensitive deposits into assets with higher-te rm\\nrates. The benefits of rising interest rates to structural earnings increased modestly relative to October 31, 2023. The exposure of falling interes t rates\\nto structural earnings decreased relative to October 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of modelled prepayment penalty fee collection on certainprepayable instruments.\\nDuring 2024, both economic value sensitivity and earnings sensitivity remained within the limits established by the Board of Directors.\\nStructural Interest Rate Sensitivity(1) (2)\\nTABLE 45\\nEconomic value sensitivity Earnings sensitivity\\n(Pre-tax Canadian $ equivalent in millions)October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023\\nCanada (3) United States Total Total Canada (3) United States Total Total\\n100 basis point increase (693) (790) (1,483) (1,849) 139 228 367 304\\n100 basis point decrease 597 63 660 1,492 (101) (109) (210) (325)\\n(1) Losses are presented in brackets and gains are presented as positive numbers.\\n(2) Interest rate sensitivities assume an immediate and sustained parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at the end of the period, using a constant balance sheet.\\n(3) Includes Canadian dollar and other currencies.\\nThe table below presents net loans and acceptances by interest rate sensitivity.\\nTABLE 46\\n(Canadian $ in millions) 2024 2023\\nFixed rate (1)\\nContractual amounts that will reprice/repay within 3 months 213,314 213,854\\nContractual amounts that will reprice/repay after 3 months 254,872 248,688\\nFloating rate (2) 202,031 186,327\\nNon-rate sensitive (3) 8,158 15,907\\nTotal 678,375 664,776\\n(1) Includes index-based loans.\\n(2) Floating rate only includes loans that reprice immediately upon a change in interest rates.(3) Includes credit card balances that are paid when due, customers’ liability under acceptances, impaired loans and allowance for credit losses.\\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified for changes in accounting policy.\\nInsurance Market Risk\\nInsurance market risk includes interest rate and equity market risk arising from the activities of our BMO Insurance business. During the 2024 fiscal\\nyear, we entered into hedging arrangements to offset the impact of changes in interest rates and equity market values on our earnings. Thesensitivity includes the impact of these hedging relationships. The impact of insurance market risk on earnings is reflected in insurance investmen t\\nresults on our Consolidated Statement of Income, and the corresponding change in insurance contract liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.The impact of insurance market risk is not reflected in the Structural Interest Rate Sensitivity table above.\\nThe bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) effective November 1, 2023. IFRS 17 changes the fundamental principles used to\\nrecognize and measure insurance contracts, including life insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts held and investment contracts with discret ionary\\nparticipation features. This change impacts the timing of when investment-related income emerges and the associated market risk sensitivities, asthe discount rates used to calculate the present value of insurance liabilities are no longer based on the assets supporting those liabilities, but ra ther\\non the features of the insurance liabilities themselves. As such, insurance market risk largely reflects the interest rate risk arising from a mismat ch in\\nliability and asset cash flows.\\nOn transition, we applied the full retrospective approach to our creditor business and the fair value approach to all other products written prior to\\nNovember 1, 2022.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\n88BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 77\\n\\n                          MD&A                          The table below reflects the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, our net income to certain changes in interest rates, and includes the\\nestimated impact of hedging arrangements.\\nTABLE 47\\n(Pre-tax Canadian $ in millions) 2024 (1) 2023\\n50 basis point increase 6 23\\n50 basis point decrease (9) (30)\\n(1) Interest rate sensitivities assume a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at the end of the period, with no chan ge in the ultimate risk-free rate.\\nFor further information, refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section and Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial\\nstatements. In addition, information on insurance risk governance can be found in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section.\\nNon-Trading Foreign Exchange Risk\\nStructural foreign exchange risk arises primarily from translation risk related to our net investment in U.S. operations and from transaction riskassociated with U.S.-dollar-denominated net income.\\nTranslation risk arises from the potential impact that changes in foreign exchange rates could have on our reported shareholders’ equity and\\ncapital ratios. We economically manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our capital ratios. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital\\nManagement section for further discussion.\\nTransaction risk arises from the potential impact that fluctuations in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate could have on the Canadian\\ndollar equivalent of BMO’s U.S.-dollar-denominated financial results. Exchange rate fluctuations will affect future results measured in Canadia n dollars,\\nand the impact on those results is a function of the periods during which revenues, expenses and provisions for credit losses arise. Hedging positionsmay be taken to partially offset the pre-tax effects of Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations on financial results, although we did not\\nenter into any hedging arrangements in the current or prior year. If future results are consistent with results in fiscal 2024, each one cent increase(decrease) in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate would be expected to increase (decrease) the Canadian dollar equivalent of U.S. segmentnet income before income taxes for the year by $26 million, in the absence of hedging arrangements. Refer to the 2024 Financial Performance\\nReview – Foreign Exchange section for a more complete discussion of the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our results.\\nLinkages between Balance Sheet Items and Market Risk Disclosures\\nThe table below presents items reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are subject to market risk, comprising balances that are subject toeither traded risk or non-traded risk measurement techniques.\\nTABLE 48\\nAs at October 31, 2024 As at October 31, 2023\\nSubject to market risk Subject to market riskPrimary risk factors\\nfor non-tradedrisk balances (Canadian $ in millions)Consolidated\\nBalance SheetTraded\\nrisk (1)Non-traded\\nrisk (2)Not subject to\\nmarket riskConsolidated\\nBalance SheetTraded\\nrisk (1)Non-traded\\nrisk (2)Not subject to\\nmarket risk\\nAssets Subject to Market Risk\\nCash and cash equivalents 65,098 – 65,098 – 77,934 – 77,934 – Interest rate\\nInterest bearing deposits with banks 3,640 201 3,439 – 4,109 236 3,873 – Interest rate\\nSecurities 396,880 153,833 243,047 – 320,084 122,926 197,158 – Interest rate,\\ncredit spread, equity\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\\nresale agreements 110,907 – 110,907 – 115,662 – 115,662 – Interest rate\\nLoans and acceptances (net of\\nallowance for credit losses) 678,016 6,085 671,931 – 656,665 4,412 652,253 – Interest rate,\\nforeign exchange\\nDerivative instruments 47,253 42,879 4,374 – 39,976 34,004 5,972 – Interest rate,\\nforeign exchange\\nCustomers’ liabilities under acceptances 359 – 359 – 8,111 – 8,111 – Interest rate\\nOther assets 107,494 9,485 59,070 38,939 124,465 4,734 82,008 37,723 Interest rate\\nTotal Assets 1,409,647 212,483 1,158,225 38,939 1,347,006 166,312 1,142,971 37,723\\nLiabilities Subject to Market Risk\\nDeposits 982,440 45,223 937,217 – 910,879 35,300 875,579 – Interest rate,\\nforeign exchange\\nDerivative instruments 58,303 54,713 3,590 – 50,193 43,166 7,027 – Interest rate,\\nforeign exchange\\nAcceptances 359 – 359 – 8,111 – 8,111 – Interest rate\\nSecurities sold but not yet purchased 35,030 35,030 – – 43,774 43,774 – – Interest rate\\nSecurities lent or sold under repurchase\\nagreements 110,791 – 110,791 – 106,108 – 106,108 – Interest rate\\nOther liabilities 130,061 – 129,590 471 143,590 33 143,497 60 Interest rate\\nSubordinated debt 8,377 – 8,377 – 8,228 – 8,228 – Interest rate\\nTotal Liabilities 1,325,361 134,966 1,189,924 471 1,270,883 122,273 1,148,550 60\\n(1) Primarily comprises balance sheet items that are subject to the trading and underwriting risk management framework and recorded at fair value thr ough profit or loss.\\n(2) Primarily comprises balance sheet items that are subject to the structural balance sheet insurance risk management framework and secured financ ing transactions.\\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation and for changes in accounting policy.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 89\\n\\n\\n## Page 78\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nInsurance Risk\\nInsurance Risk is the potential for loss as a result of actual experience differing from that assumed when an insurance product was designed and\\npriced, and comprises claims risk, policyholder behaviour risk and expense risk.\\nInsurance risk generally entails the inherent unpredictability that can arise from the assumption of long-term policy liabilities or uncertainty r egarding\\nfuture events. Insurance provides protection against the financial consequences of insured risks by transferring those risks to the insurer (underspecific terms and conditions) in exchange for premiums. Insurance risk is inherent in all of our insurance products: life insurance, annuities (whi ch\\ninclude the pension risk transfer business), accident and sickness insurance, and creditor insurance, as well as the reinsurance business. Insuran ce risk\\nconsists of:\\n‰Claims risk – the risk that the actual magnitude or frequency of claims will differ from those assumed in the pricing or underwriting process,including mortality risk, morbidity risk, longevity risk and catastrophic risk.\\n‰Policyholder behaviour risk – the risk that the behaviour of policyholders in regard to premium payments, withdrawals or loans, as well as policylapses and surrenders and other voluntary terminations, will differ from the behaviour assumed in the pricing process.\\n‰Expense risk – the risk that actual expenses arising from acquiring and administering policies and processing claims will exceed the expensesassumed in the pricing process.\\nOur risk governance practices provide effective independent oversight and control of risk within BMO Insurance. BMO Insurance’s risk management\\nframework addresses the identification, assessment, management, monitoring and reporting of risks. The framework includes: the Risk AppetiteStatement and key risk metrics; insurance risk policies and processes, including limits; capital requirements; stress testing; risk reports; the O wn Risk\\nand Solvency Assessment; and ongoing monitoring of experience. Senior management within the various lines of business uses this framework,serving as the first line of defence and assuming the primary responsibility for managing insurance risk. Second-line-of-defence oversight is prov ided\\nby the CRO, BMO Insurance, who reports to the CRO, BMO Wealth Management. Internal risk committees, the boards of directors of the BMO Insurancesubsidiaries and senior management provide senior governance and review. In particular, the Risk Committee of BMO Insurance oversees and reportson risk management activities to the insurance companies’ boards of directors on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Audit and Conduct ReviewCommittee of the Board of Directors acts as the Audit and Conduct Review Committee for BMO Life Insurance Company.\\nA robust product approval process is a cornerstone of the BMO Insurance risk management framework, as it identifies, assesses and manages\\nrisks associated with new insurance products or changes to existing products. This process, along with guidelines and practices for underwriting an d\\nclaims management, promotes the effective identification, assessment and management of insurance risk. Reinsurance transactions that transfer o r\\ncede insurance risk from BMO Insurance to independent reinsurance companies also mitigate our exposure to insurance risk by diversifying risk andlimiting claims. BMO Insurance has exited the Property and Casualty Reinsurance market, with the last remaining treaty terminated in January 2021,significantly reducing our exposure to catastrophic claims and, in turn, the risks arising from climate change. However, a certain portion of ourexposure to catastrophic claims remains as the portfolio runs off and until all outstanding claims that were made prior to the treaty termination date s\\nare settled and paid.\\nThe table below presents the sensitivities before and after risk mitigation by reinsurance and assumes that all other variables remain constant.\\nTABLE 49\\n2024 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions)Contractual service margin Profit or loss Contractual service margin Profit or loss\\nGross Net Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net\\nPolicy-related assumptions\\nMortality rates (1% increase) (1) (17) 10 1 1 (14) 9 – –\\nLapse rates (10% increase) (2) (151) (52) (10) (4) (161) (63) (4) (2)\\nExpenses (5% increase) (3) (15) (15) – – (9) (9) – –\\n(1) Mortality relates to the occurrence of death and is a key assumption for our life insurance business.\\n(2) Policies are terminated through lapses and surrenders, where lapses represent the termination of policies due to non-payment of premiums and sur renders represent the voluntary termination of\\npolicies by policyholders.\\n(3) Directly attributable operating expense assumptions reflect the projected costs of maintaining and servicing in-force policies, including as sociated directly attributable overhead expenses.\\nCaution\\nThis Insurance Risk section contains forward-looking statements.

The Corporate Treasury group is responsible for monitoring and reporting on exposures to liquidity andfunding risk across the enterprise; develops and recommends for approval the Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework and the relatedrisk appetite statement and limits; monitors compliance with relevant corporate policies; and assesses the impact of market events on liquidity andfunding requirements on an ongoing basis.\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM), as the second line of defence, exercises oversight, conducts independent risk assessment and\\nprovides effective challenge of liquidity and funding management frameworks, policies, limits, monitoring and reporting across the enterprise.\\nThe Risk Management Committee (RMC) and Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) provide senior management oversight, and review and discuss\\nsignificant liquidity and funding policies, issues and developments that arise in the pursuit of BMO’s strategic priorities. The Risk Review Commit tee\\n(RRC) provides oversight of the management of liquidity and funding risk, annually approves the applicable policies, limits and contingency plan, a nd\\nregularly reviews liquidity and funding positions.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Management\\nBMO’s Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework is defined and authorized in alignment with corporate policies approved by our Board ofDirectors and standards approved by management. These policies and standards set out key management principles, liquidity and funding metricsand related limits, as well as roles and responsibilities in the management of liquidity and funding risk across the enterprise.\\nWe have a robust limit structure in place in order to manage liquidity and funding risk. These limits define BMO’s risk appetite for the key Stress\\nNet Liquidity Position (Stress NLP) measure, regulatory liquidity ratios, secured and unsecured funding appetite (for both trading and structuralactivities), as well as enterprise collateral pledging. Limits also establish the tolerance for concentrations of maturities, as well as requireme nts for\\ncounterparty liability diversification, business pledging activity, and the size and type of committed and uncommitted credit and liquidity facil ities that\\nmay be outstanding.\\nOperating within these limits helps to confirm that liquidity and funding risk is appropriately managed. An enterprise-wide contingency plan\\nintended to facilitate effective risk management in the event of a disruption is also in place. Early warning indicators identified in the contingenc y\\nplan are regularly monitored in order to detect any signs of rising levels of liquidity or funding risk in the market, or any exposure to other risksspecific to BMO.\\nBMO legal entities include regulated and foreign subsidiaries and branches, and as a result, movements of funds between entities in the\\ncorporate group are subject to, among other things, the liquidity, funding and capital adequacy requirements of these entities. As such, liquidity a nd\\nfunding positions are managed on both a consolidated and key legal entity basis. Liquidity and funding risk management policies and limits, informedby the laws and regulations that apply to each entity, are in place for key legal entities, and positions are regularly reviewed at the key legal entitylevel to confirm compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\\nBMO continued to maintain a strong liquidity position during fiscal 2024. Customer loans and deposits continued to grow, while wholesale\\nfunding decreased, reflecting net maturities. Our liquidity metrics, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NS FR),\\nexceeded internal targets and regulatory requirements throughout fiscal 2024.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Measurement\\nA key component of liquidity risk management is the measurement of liquidity risk under stress. We use Stress NLP as a key measure of liquidity risk.Stress NLP represents the amount by which liquid assets exceed potential funding needs under severe systemic and enterprise-specific stressscenarios, and a combination thereof. Potential funding needs may arise from obligations to repay retail, commercial and wholesale deposits that ar e\\nwithdrawn or not renewed, or to fund drawdowns on available credit and liquidity lines, as well as from obligations to pledge collateral due to ratingsdowngrades or market volatility, along with the continuing need to fund new assets and strategic investments. Potential funding needs are quantifie d\\nby applying factors to various business activities based on management’s view of the relative level of liquidity risk related to each activity. Thesefactors vary by deposit classification (e.g., retail, small business, non-financial corporate or wholesale counterparties) and deposit type (e.g ., insured,\\nuninsured, operational or non-operational deposits), as well as by commitment type (e.g., committed or uncommitted credit or liquidity facilities by\\ncounterparty type). Stress scenarios also consider the time horizon over which liquid assets can be monetized and management’s assessment of theliquidity value of those assets under conditions of market stress. These potential funding needs are assessed under severe systemic and enterprise-specific stress scenarios, and a combination thereof.\\nStress testing results are evaluated against our stated risk appetite and are considered in management’s decisions on limit-setting and internal\\nliquidity transfer pricing, and they also help to inform and shape the design of business plans and contingency plans. The Liquidity and Funding RiskManagement Framework is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing.\\nIn addition to Stress NLP, we regularly monitor positions in relation to the limits and liquidity ratios noted in the Liquidity and Funding Risk\\nManagement section above. These include regulatory metrics such as LCR, Net Cumulative Cash Flow and NSFR.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 91\\n\\n\\n## Page 80\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nUnencumbered Liquid Assets\\nUnencumbered liquid assets include high-quality assets that are marketable, can be pledged as security for borrowings, and can be converted to cash\\nin a time frame that meets liquidity and funding requirements. Liquid assets are primarily held in our trading businesses, as well as in supplementalliquidity pools that are maintained for contingent liquidity risk management purposes. The liquidity values recognized for different asset classes under\\nBMO’s risk management framework reflect management’s assessment of the liquidity values of those assets under a severe stress scenario. Liquidassets held in our trading businesses comprise cash on deposit with central banks, short-term deposits with other financial institutions, highly-r ated\\ndebt securities, equity securities and short-term reverse repurchase agreements. Supplemental liquidity pool assets primarily comprise cash ondeposit with central banks, securities, and short-term reverse repurchase agreements for highly-rated Canadian federal and provincial governmen t\\ndebt and U.S. federal government and agency debt. Substantially all supplemental liquidity pool assets meet the definition of high-quality liquidassets under Basel III. The size of the supplemental liquidity pool is integrated with our assessment of liquidity risk. In order to comply with localregulatory requirements, certain legal entities maintain their own minimum liquidity positions. There may be legal and regulatory restrictions onBMO’s ability to use liquid assets held at one legal entity to support the liquidity requirements of another legal entity.\\nIn the normal course of business, we may encumber a portion of cash and securities holdings as collateral in support of trading activities and\\nparticipation in clearing and payment systems in Canada and abroad. In addition, we may receive liquid assets as collateral and may re-pledge theseassets in exchange for cash or as collateral in support of trading activities. Net unencumbered liquid assets, defined as on-balance sheet assets, su ch\\nas BMO-owned cash and securities and securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, plus other off-balance sheet eligible collateralreceived, less assets encumbered as collateral, totalled $396.3 billion as at October 31, 2024, compared with $357.9 billion as at October 31, 2023.\\nThe increase in unencumbered liquid assets was primarily due to higher securities balances, partially offset by lower cash balances. Net\\nunencumbered liquid assets are primarily held at the parent bank level, at BMO Bank N.A. and in our broker/dealer operations. In addition to liquidassets, we have access to the Bank of Canada’s lending assistance programs, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window in the United States, theBank of England’s Sterling Monetary Framework and European Central Bank standby liquidity facilities. We do not consider central bank facilities asource of available liquidity when assessing the soundness of our liquidity position.\\nIn addition to cash and securities holdings, we may also pledge other assets, including mortgages and loans, to raise long-term secured funding.\\nAs part of the Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework, a Pledging of Assets corporate policy sets out the framework and limits forpledging financial and non-financial assets.\\nBMO’s total encumbered assets and unencumbered liquid assets are summarized in the table below.

Secured and unsecured wholesale funding for liquidtrading assets is largely shorter-term (maturing in one year or less), is aligned with the liquidity of the assets being funded and is subject to limits on\\naggregate maturities across different periods. Supplemental liquidity pools are funded largely with wholesale term funding.\\nWe maintain a large and stable base of customer deposits that, in combination with our strong capital position, is a source of strength. This\\nsupports the maintenance of a sound liquidity position and reduces our reliance on wholesale funding. Customer deposits totalled $715.3 billion asat October 31, 2024, increasing from $654.3 billion in fiscal 2023, driven by strong underlying deposit growth across all business groups.\\nTotal secured and unsecured wholesale funding outstanding, which largely consists of negotiable marketable securities, was $255.5 billion as at\\nOctober 31, 2024, with $67.5 billion sourced as secured funding and $188.0 billion sourced as unsecured funding. Total wholesale funding outstandin g\\ndecreased from $269.6 billion as at October 31, 2023, primarily due to net maturities of wholesale funding during the year. The mix and maturities ofBMO’s wholesale term funding are outlined later in this section. Additional information on deposit maturities can also be found in the ContractualMaturities of Assets and Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments section. We maintain a sizeable portfolio of unencumbered liquid assets,totalling $396.3 billion as at October 31, 2024 and $357.9 billion as at October 31, 2023, that can be monetized to meet potential fundingrequirements, as described in the Unencumbered Liquid Assets section above.\\nWholesale Funding Maturities(1)\\nTABLE 53\\nAs at October 31, 2024 As at October 31, 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions)Less than\\n1 month1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o1 2\\nmonthsSubtotal less\\nthan 1 year1t o2\\nyearsOver\\n2 years Total Total\\nDeposits from banks 2,531 1,283 556 1,222 5,592 7 – 5,599 7,714\\nCertificates of deposit and commercial\\npaper 12,023 23,099 23,525 30,838 89,485 864 – 90,349 94,372\\nBearer deposit notes 1,437 2,332 462 407 4,638 – – 4,638 954\\nAsset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) 1,702 2,453 5,114 343 9,612 – – 9,612 6,005\\nSenior unsecured medium-term notes 609 5,120 3,096 12,443 21,268 7,374 39,271 67,913 70,749\\nSenior unsecured structured notes (2) – – 14 297 311 498 10,283 11,092 9,415\\nSecured funding\\nMortgage and HELOC securitizations 25 781 909 1,474 3,189 2,752 12,246 18,187 17,916\\nCovered bonds – – – 4,117 4,117 12,267 10,585 26,969 28,412\\nOther asset-backed securitizations (3) ––––– 1,330 5,786 7,116 7,661\\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances – – – 1,460 1,460 1,391 2,782 5,633 18,148\\nSubordinated debt ––––– 2 5 8,378 8,403 8,227\\nTotal 18,327 35,068 33,676 52,601 139,672 26,508 89,331 255,511 269,573\\nOf which:\\nSecured 1,727 3,234 6,023 7,394 18,378 17,740 31,399 67,517 78,142\\nUnsecured 16,600 31,834 27,653 45,207 121,294 8,768 57,932 187,994 191,431\\nTotal (4) 18,327 35,068 33,676 52,601 139,672 26,508 89,331 255,511 269,573\\n(1) Wholesale unsecured funding primarily includes funding raised through the issuance of negotiable marketable securities.

The funding plan\\nconsiders expected maturities, as well as asset and liability growth projected for businesses in our forecasting and planning processes, and assess es\\nfunding needs in relation to the sources available. The plan is reviewed annually by the senior management committees with specific relatedresponsibilities and approved by the RRC, and is regularly updated to reflect actual results and incorporate updated forecast information.\\nRegulatory Developments\\nOSFI has announced proposed changes to its Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline that are expected to become effective in fiscal 2025.Under the proposal, BMO will be required to regularly file reports related to intraday liquidity management with OSFI. These changes are not expectedto have a material impact on our liquidity and funding practices.\\nCredit Ratings\\nThe credit ratings assigned to BMO’s short-term and senior long-term debt securities by external rating agencies are important in raising both capit al\\nand funding to support the bank’s business operations. Maintaining strong credit ratings allows us to access the wholesale markets at competitivepricing levels. Should BMO’s credit ratings experience a downgrade, our cost of funding may increase and our access to funding and capital throughthe wholesale markets could be constrained. A material downgrade of BMO’s ratings could also have other consequences, including those set out inNote 8 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe credit ratings assigned to BMO’s senior debt by rating agencies are indicative of high-grade, high-quality issues. In fiscal 2024, Moody’s,\\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch and DBRS affirmed their ratings and maintained their stable outlook on BMO.\\nTABLE 54\\nAs at October 31, 2024\\nRating agency Short-term debt Senior debt (1)Long-term deposits /\\nLegacy senior debt (2)Subordinated\\ndebt (NVCC) Outlook\\nMoody’s P-1 A2 Aa2 Baa1 (hyb) Stable\\nS&P A-1 A- A+ BBB+ StableFitch F1+ AA- AA A StableDBRS R-1 (high) AA (low) AA A (low) Stable\\n(1) Subject to conversion under the Bank Recapitalization (Bail-In) Regime.\\n(2) Long-term deposits / Legacy senior debt includes senior debt issued prior to September 23, 2018 and senior debt issued on or after September 23, 201 8 that is excluded from the Bank\\nRecapitalization (Bail-In) Regime.\\nWe are required to deliver collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of BMO’s current credit rating.

Net cash flows include outflows from deposits, secured and unsecured wholesalefunding, commitments and potential collateral requirements, offset by permitted inflows from loans, securities lending activities and other non- HQLA\\ndebt maturing over a 30-day horizon. Weightings prescribed by OSFI are applied to cash flows and HQLA to arrive at the weighted values and the LCR.The LCR does not reflect liquidity in BMO Financial Corp. (BFC) in excess of 100%, because of limitations on the transfer of liquidity between BFC andthe parent bank. Canadian domestic systemically important banks, including BMO, are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. The averagedaily LCR for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 was 132%, equivalent to a surplus of $61.0 billion above the regulatory minimum. The LCRincreased 4% from 128% in fiscal 2023, as higher HQLA more than offset an increase in net cash outflows. While banks are required to maintain anLCR of greater than 100% in normal conditions, they are also expected to be able to utilize HQLA during a period of stress, which may result in an LCRof less than 100% during such a period. The LCR is only one measure of a bank’s liquidity position and does not fully capture all of its liquid assets orthe funding alternatives that may be available during a period of stress. BMO’s total liquid assets are shown in the table below.\\nTABLE 55\\nAs at October 31, 2024\\n(Canadian $ in billions, except as noted)Total unweighted value\\n(average) (1) (2)Total weighted value\\n(average) (2) (3)\\nHigh-Quality Liquid Assets\\nTotal high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) * 253.4\\nCash Outflows\\nRetail deposits and deposits from small business customers, of which: 302.3 21.7\\nStable deposits 139.9 4.2\\nLess stable deposits 162.4 17.5\\nUnsecured wholesale funding, of which: 312.7 137.4\\nOperational deposits (all counterparties) and deposits in networks of cooperative banks 153.5 38.0\\nNon-operational deposits (all counterparties) 140.0 80.2\\nUnsecured debt 19.2 19.2\\nSecured wholesale funding * 23.0\\nAdditional requirements, of which: 258.7 52.4\\nOutflows related to derivatives exposures and other collateral requirements 32.4 8.7\\nOutflows related to loss of funding on debt products 2.7 2.7\\nCredit and liquidity facilities 223.6 41.0\\nOther contractual funding obligations 0.8 –\\nOther contingent funding obligations 544.3 11.3\\nTotal cash outflows * 245.8\\nCash Inflows\\nSecured lending (e.g., reverse repos) 164.0 24.1\\nInflows from fully performing exposures 18.1 9.9\\nOther cash inflows 19.4 19.4\\nTotal cash inflows 201.5 53.4\\nTotal adjusted value (4)\\nTotal HQLA 253.4\\nTotal net cash outflows 192.4\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (%) 132\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2023 Total adjusted value (4)\\nTotal HQLA 228.4\\nTotal net cash outflows 178.5\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (%) 128\\n* Disclosure is not required under the LCR disclosure standard.\\n(1) Unweighted values are calculated at market value (for HQLA) or as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflo ws).\\n(2) Values are calculated based on the simple average of the daily LCR over 62 business days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.(3) Weighted values are calculated after the application of the weights prescribed under the OSFI Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline f or HQLA and cash inflows and outflows.\\n(4) Adjusted values are calculated based on total weighted values after applicable caps, as defined in the LAR Guideline.\\n96BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 85\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Net Stable Funding Ratio\\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a regulatory metric that assesses the stability of a bank’s funding profile in relation to the liquidity value of its\\nassets and is calculated in accordance with OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline. Unlike the LCR, which is a short-term metric, the NSFRassesses a bank’s medium-term and long-term resilience. The NSFR is defined as the ratio of the amount of available stable funding (ASF) to theamount of required stable funding (RSF). ASF represents the proportion of own and third-party resources that are expected to be reliably available toa bank over a one-year time horizon (including customer deposits, long-term wholesale funding and capital). The stable funding requirements foreach institution are set by OSFI based on the liquidity and maturity characteristics of its balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures.Weightings prescribed by OSFI are applied to notional asset and liability balances to determine ASF, RSF and the NSFR. Canadian domestic systemicall y\\nimportant banks, including BMO, are required to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%. BMO’s NSFR was 117% as at October 31, 2024, equivalent to asurplus of $115.4 billion above the regulatory minimum. The NSFR increased from 115% as at October 31, 2023, as higher ASF more than offset theincrease in RSF.\\nTABLE 56\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2024\\nUnweighted value by residual maturity\\nWeighted\\nvalue (2) (Canadian $ in billions, except as noted)No\\nmaturity (1)Less than 6\\nmonths6t o1 2\\nmonths Over 1 year\\nAvailable Stable Funding (ASF) Item\\nCapital: – – – 95.4 95.4\\nRegulatory capital – – – 95.4 95.4\\nOther capital instruments –– –– –\\nRetail deposits and deposits from small business customers: 227.4 70.2 41.8 74.4 379.8\\nStable deposits 114.2 27.5 17.3 15.4 166.5\\nLess stable deposits 113.2 42.7 24.5 59.0 213.3\\nWholesale funding: 310.0 275.0 66.4 106.4 293.0\\nOperational deposits 151.0 – – – 75.5\\nOther wholesale funding 159.0 275.0 66.4 106.4 217.5\\nLiabilities with matching interdependent assets – 1.3 0.6 13.9 –\\nOther liabilities: 3.0 * * 77.5 20.5\\nNSFR derivative liabilities ** * 5 . 3 *\\nAll other liabilities and equity not included in the above categories 3.0 51.5 0.3 20.4 20.5\\nTotal ASF * * * * 788.7\\nRequired Stable Funding (RSF) Item\\nTotal NSFR high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) * * * * 18.5\\nDeposits held at other financial institutions for operational purposes – 0.2 – – 0.1\\nPerforming loans and securities: 202.3 211.3 74.3 362.1 538.3\\nPerforming loans to financial institutions secured by Level 1 HQLA – 94.1 3.2 – 4.0\\nPerforming loans to financial institutions secured by non-Level 1 HQLA and unsecured\\nperforming loans to financial institutions 32.0 61.5 8.7 21.3 65.0\\nPerforming loans to non-financial corporate clients, loans to retail and small business\\ncustomers, and loans to sovereigns, central banks and public sector entities, of which: 124.8 39.4 44.3 167.8 287.9\\nWith a risk weight of less than or equal to 35% under the Basel II standardized approach\\nfor credit risk –– –– –\\nPerforming residential mortgages, of which: 13.6 13.8 17.7 143.7 127.9\\nWith a risk weight of less than or equal to 35% under the Basel II standardized\\napproach for credit risk 13.6 13.8 17.7 143.7 127.9\\nSecurities that are not in default and do not qualify as HQLA, including exchange-traded equities 31.9 2.5 0.4 29.3 53.5\\nAssets with matching interdependent liabilities – 1.3 0.6 13.9 –\\nOther assets: 46.6 * * 101.7 94.6\\nPhysical traded commodities, including gold 9.5 * * * 8.1\\nAssets posted as initial margin for derivative contracts and contributions to default\\nfunds of CCPs * * * 17.7 15.0\\nNSFR derivative assets * * * 3.8 –\\nNSFR derivative liabilities before deduction of variation margin posted * * * 14.6 0.7\\nAll other assets not included in the above categories 37.1 41.0 0.3 24.3 70.8\\nOff-balance sheet items – – – 623.3 21.8\\nTotal RSF * * * * 673.3\\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (%) * * * * 117\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2023Weighted\\nvalue (2)\\nTotal ASF 724.1\\nTotal RSF 627.8\\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (%) 115\\n* Disclosure is not required under the NSFR disclosure standard.\\n(1) Items in the no maturity column do not have a stated maturity.

The\\ncontractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities is an input to, but is not necessarily consistent with, the expected maturity of assets andliabilities that is used in the management of liquidity and funding risk. We forecast asset and liability cash flows, under both normal marketconditions and a number of stress scenarios to manage liquidity and funding risk. Stress scenarios incorporate assumptions for loan repayments,deposit withdrawals, and credit commitment and liquidity facility drawdowns by counterparty and product type. Stress scenarios also consider thetime horizon over which liquid assets can be monetized and the related discounts (“haircuts”) and potential collateral requirements that may arisefrom both market volatility and credit rating downgrades, among other assumptions.\\nTABLE 57\\n2024\\n(Canadian $ in millions)0t o1\\nmonth1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o9\\nmonths9t o1 2\\nmonths1t o2\\nyears2t o5\\nyearsOver 5\\nyearsNo\\nmaturity Total\\nOn-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\\nAssets\\nCash and cash equivalents 62,827 ––––––– 2,271 65,098\\nInterest bearing deposits with banks 2,513 628 481 18 – – – – – 3,640\\nSecurities 6,787 14,011 7,840 6,707 9,720 21,264 84,775 172,886 72,890 396,880\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\\nresale agreements 85,185 16,803 5,701 2,330 888 – – – – 110,907\\nLoans (1)\\nResidential mortgages 1,683 3,284 6,413 6,653 9,252 52,489 77,867 33,227 212 191,080\\nConsumer instalment and other personal 581 974 1,703 1,827 2,671 14,815 24,595 18,830 26,691 92,687\\nCredit cards –––––––– 13,612 13,612\\nBusiness and government 8,647 14,418 16,461 19,448 21,828 63,613 105,740 32,444 102,394 384,993\\nAllowance for credit losses –––––––– (4,356) (4,356)\\nTotal loans, net of allowance 10,911 18,676 24,577 27,928 33,751 130,917 208,202 84,501 138,553 678,016\\nOther assets\\nDerivative instruments 5,573 7,996 7,211 2,482 1,660 6,365 8,374 7,592 – 47,253\\nCustomers’ liabilities under acceptances 3 5 9–––––––– 3 5 9\\nReceivable from brokers, dealers and\\nclients 31,916 –––––––– 31,916\\nOther 3,847 1,012 948 31 14 13 13 7,717 61,983 75,578\\nTotal other assets 41,695 9,008 8,159 2,513 1,674 6,378 8,387 15,309 61,983 155,106\\nTotal assets 209,918 59,126 46,758 39,496 46,033 158,559 301,364 272,696 275,697 1,409,647\\nTABLE 58\\n2024\\n(Canadian $ in millions)0t o1\\nmonth1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o9\\nmonths9t o1 2\\nmonths1t o2\\nyears2t o5\\nyearsOver 5\\nyearsNo\\nmaturity Total\\nLiabilities and Equity\\nDeposits (2) (3) 47,637 74,759 69,479 68,110 48,835 51,789 87,297 25,602 508,932 982,440\\nOther liabilities\\nDerivative instruments 6,769 10,541 10,828 3,311 2,160 6,470 9,112 9,112 – 58,303\\nAcceptances 3 5 9–––––––– 3 5 9\\nSecurities sold but not yet purchased (4) 35,030 –––––––– 35,030\\nSecurities lent or sold under repurchase\\nagreements (4) 99,364 7,777 721 106 1,016 1,807 – – – 110,791\\nSecuritization and structured entities’\\nliabilities 44 981 1,072 2,183 152 4,353 9,913 21,466 – 40,164\\nInsurance-related liabilities 93 89 18 18 30 83 195 701 17,543 18,770\\nPayable to brokers, dealers and clients 34,407 –––––––– 34,407\\nOther 12,409 2,968 805 144 1,611 2,492 4,058 2,799 9,434 36,720\\nTotal other liabilities 188,475 22,356 13,444 5,762 4,969 15,205 23,278 34,078 26,977 334,544\\nSubordinated debt ––––– 2 5 2 5 8,327 – 8,377\\nTotal equity –––––––– 84,286 84,286\\nTotal liabilities and equity 236,112 97,115 82,923 73,872 53,804 67,019 110,600 68,007 620,195 1,409,647\\n(1) Loans receivable on demand have been included under no maturity.\\n(2) Deposits payable on demand and payable after notice have been included under no maturity.(3) Deposits totalling $29,136 million as at October 31, 2024 have a fixed maturity date; however, they can be redeemed early (either fully or partiall y) by customers without penalty.

These losses can stem from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, humanerror or misconduct, and external events that may directly or indirectly impact the fair value of assets we hold in our credit or investmentportfolios. Examples of these risks include cyber and information security risk, technology risk, fraud risk and business continuity risk, but excl ude\\nlegal and regulatory risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and other types of financial risk.\\nOperational non-financial risk (ONFR) is inherent in all our business and banking activities and can lead to significant impacts on our operating and\\nfinancial results, including financial loss, restatements of financial results and damage to BMO’s reputation. Like other financial service organ izations,\\nwe are exposed to a variety of operational risks arising from potential failure of our internal processes, technology systems and employees, as wellas from external threats. Potential losses may be the result of process and control failures, unauthorized transactions by employees, businessdisruption, information security breaches, theft or fraud and cyber security threats, exposure to risks related to third-party relationships and d amage\\nto physical assets. For example, given the large volume of transactions that we process daily and the complexity and speed of our businessoperations, it is possible that certain operational or human errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.\\nONFR is not only inherent in our business and banking activities, it is also inherent in the processes and controls we use to manage risks. There is\\nthe possibility that errors could occur, as well as the possibility that a failure in our internal processes or systems could lead to a failure to manage or\\nmitigate risk, financial loss and reputational harm. Shortcomings or failures of internal processes, systems or employees, or of services and produ cts\\nprovided by third parties, including any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems, could lead to financial loss, restatements o f\\nfinancial results and damage to BMO’s reputation.\\nThe nature of our business activities also exposes us to the risk of theft and fraud when we transact with customers or counterparties. BMO relies\\non the accuracy and completeness of any information provided by, and any other representations made by, customers and counterparties. While weconduct due diligence in relation to such customer information and, where practicable and economically feasible, engage valuation experts and othe r\\nexperts or sources of information to assist in assessing the value of collateral and other customer risks, our financial results may be adverselyimpacted if the information provided by customers or counterparties is materially misleading and this is not discovered during the due diligenceprocess.\\nWe have established various risk management frameworks to manage and mitigate these risks, including internal controls, limits and\\ngovernance processes. However, despite the contingency plans we have in place to maintain our ability to serve our clients and minimize disruptionsand adverse impacts, and the contingency plans of our third-party service providers, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by adisruption to the infrastructure that supports our operations and the communities in which we do business, including, but not limited to, disruptioncaused by public health or other emergencies, civil disorder, acts of war or terrorism.\\nWe regularly review top and emerging risk exposures that could impact BMO’s business and operations, and we assess our preparedness to\\nproactively manage the risks we face or could face in the future. Consistent with the management of risk across the enterprise, we employ a three-lines-of-defence approach in managing our exposures to non-financial risk.\\nRefer to the Risks That May Affect Future Results – Top and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results section for further discussion of these\\nrisks.\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Governance\\nThe Operational Risk Committee (ORC), a sub-committee of the Risk Management Committee (RMC), is the primary governance committee exercisingoversight of all operational non-financial risk management matters, including: providing direction on, and monitoring against, strategic object ives and\\ndeliverables; and improving operational resilience, with the objective of maintaining BMO’s reputation for preventing avoidable operating failu res and\\nmistakes. As part of its governance responsibilities, the ORC reviews and recommends corporate policies and standards to the Risk Review Committee(RRC), the RMC and senior executives for review and approval as required, as well as the methodologies and tools that comprise the governingprinciples of the Operational Non-Financial Risk Management (ONFRM) framework. The documentation that gives effect to these governing principlesis reviewed on a regular basis in order to confirm that it incorporates sound governance practices and is consistent with BMO’s risk appetite. Regularanalysis and reporting of our enterprise operational risk profile to the various committees (ORC, RMC and RRC) are important elements of our riskgovernance framework. Operational risk reporting provides an integrated view of top and emerging risks, trends in loss data, capital consumption,key risk indicators (KRIs) and operating group profiles. We continue to invest in our reporting platforms, supporting timely and comprehensivereporting capabilities in order to enhance risk transparency and facilitate the proactive management of operational risk exposures.\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Management\\nAs the first line of defence, the operating groups and Corporate Services are accountable for the day-to-day management of non-financial risk,including the Chief Risk Officers of our businesses, who provide governance and oversight for their respective business units, along with CorporateServices, which provides additional governance and oversight in certain targeted areas. Operational Risk Officers independently assess the opera tional\\nrisk profiles of our operating groups, identify material exposures and potential weaknesses in our product, service and process-based risk and cont rol\\nenvironment, and recommend appropriate mitigation strategies and actions.\\nIndependent risk management oversight is provided by ONFRM, which is responsible for developing and implementing effective risk-related\\nstrategies, tools and policies, and for exercising second-line oversight, effective challenge and governance. ONFR sets out and maintains the ONFR M\\nframework, which defines the processes to be used by the first line of defence to identify, assess, manage, monitor, mitigate and report on keyoperational risk exposures, losses and near-miss operational risk events with significant potential impact. In addition, the ONFRM framework sets out\\nthe processes by which ONFRM, as the second line of defence, guides, supports, monitors, assesses and communicates with the first line in itsmanagement of operational non-financial risks.\\n100 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 89', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 11, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667361', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 89\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Implementing the governing principles of the ONFRM framework also involves continuing to strengthen our risk culture and reinforce ethical and\\nresponsible behaviour by setting clear expectations from leadership, promoting greater awareness and understanding of non-financial risk across all\\nthree lines of defence, learning from loss events and near-misses, providing related training and communication, and aiming to ensure effectivepositive reinforcement and consequence management. BMO’s Board of Directors has overall accountability for BMO’s culture. We continue tostrengthen our second-line-of-defence support and oversight capabilities with an enhanced Operational Non-Financial Risk Operating Model, whic h\\ntakes a differentiated approach based on the nature of the underlying risk and existing organizational structures.\\nThrough the implementation and oversight of the ONFRM framework, we seek to maintain an operational risk profile that is consistent with our\\nrisk appetite and supported by adequate capital, and reflects our commitment to an ethical culture defined by BMO’s values, including integrity andresponsible risk management, reinforced by enhanced operational resilience. Operational resilience is an organization’s ability to protect and s ustain\\ncore business products and services that are essential for its clients, both during the normal course of business and when experiencing operationalstress or disruption. It involves the ability to deal with unpredictable events and adapt to changes and external circumstances, and is an outcome ofeffective management of ONFR. Operational resilience is a positive, forward-looking strategic positioning that allows us to take measured risks wi th\\nconfidence and prepare BMO to withstand challenges in the market arising from both expected and unexpected events.\\nIn August 2024, OSFI released Guideline E-21, which sets out revised operational risk management and new operational resilience requirements\\nfor financial institutions. We are further enhancing our program to comply with these requirements by September 2026.\\nThe following are the key programs, methodologies and processes set out in the ONFRM framework that assist us in the ongoing review of our\\noperational non-financial risk profile:\\n‰BMO has transitioned to a new program for the assessment of non-financial risk, known as Product/Service and Process Risk Assessment . This\\nprogram is used by our operating groups and Corporate Services to assess the controls and residual risk exposures in their business operations byfocusing on the key controls applied to their products, services, internal activities and processes. It provides a current and forward-looking view of\\nthe impact of both our internal controls and the external business environment on the risk profiles of our operating groups and Corporate Services,supporting the proactive identification, assessment, management, monitoring and mitigation of risk.\\n‰BMO’s Initiative Assessment and Approval Process is used to assess, document and approve new products and services when a new business,\\nproduct or service is developed, or existing products and services are enhanced, as well as review projects which could impact the existing controlenvironment. This process supports continuous oversight of change in risk exposure by setting out specific requirements for due diligence, approva l,\\nmonitoring and reporting that apply at all levels of the organization.\\n‰Material trends, metrics and risk assessments comprising Key Risk Indicators, Issues Management andInternal Loss Data Events are integral\\ncomponents of an operational risk profile and are utilized to assess specific risk exposures in relation to BMO’s overall risk appetite.\\n‰Historical Internal Loss Data Events are recorded and maintained within the bank’s central operational risk platform. Our policies and standards\\nrequire the timely, concise and accurate reporting of events, including second line effective challenge. Root cause analysis is undertaken onmaterial events and loss data is monitored based on the bank’s risk appetite.\\n‰Operational Risk Capital Measurement : The bank’s operational risk capital is determined using the Basel III Standardized Approach (SA), which is\\na product of the Business Indicator Component (BIC) and Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM). BIC is a financial statement-based proxy representing activ ity\\nwithin the bank and ILM is a proxy representing the control environment relative to activity. ILM is a mathematical calculation based on 10-yearaverage historical losses (net of recoveries) and the three-year average BIC.\\n‰Stress Testing Scenario Analysis assesses the potential impact of severe, hypothetical but plausible scenarios covering material and emerging\\nrisks, as well as critical business processes at the bank. Results of the stress test scenarios are leveraged to derive operational loss projections t hat\\nmay be used for risk management (understanding areas of concentration, susceptibility, prioritizing incremental risk mitigation strategies, etc .) and\\nrisk measurement (understanding exposures, benchmarking, developing KRIs, controls and supporting regulatory stress submissions).\\n‰BMO’s Corporate Risk & Insurance (CR&I) group provides a second layer of mitigation for certain operational risk exposures. CR&I is also\\naccountable for establishing and maintaining the enterprise-wide insurance program. We purchase insurance when required by law, regulation orcontractual agreement, and when it is economically attractive and practicable to mitigate our risks, in order to provide adequate protection agains t\\nunexpected material loss. The policy structures and coverage provisions of our insurance positions are assessed annually to confirm alignment withBMO’s overall risk tolerance.\\n‰BMO is evolving its approach to overseeing payment risk by horizontally assessing both financial and non-financial risks, which can arise at anystage in the end-to-end life cycle of its products and services.\\nThe following are some of the operational non-financial risks that may adversely affect BMO’s business and financial results.\\nAnti-Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Risk\\nMoney laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risks are associated wi th laundering the proceeds of crime, financing terrorist activity or vi olating\\neconomic sanctions by making use of the bank’s products or services. Complia nce with applicable anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing ( AML/\\nATF) and sanctions measures is critical to safeguarding BMO, our custo mers and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to managing\\nAML/ATF and sanctions risks effectively, and to complying with releva nt laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\\nconsequences of non-compliance with these requirements include legal pr oceedings, financial losses, regulatory enforcement actions, sanctions and\\nfines, criminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or a n inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in investor and customer\\nconfidence, and damage to our reputation. Under the direction of the Chie f Anti-Money Laundering Officer (CAMLO), BMO’s enterprise AML/ATF and\\nsanctions compliance program promotes effective governance and oversi ght across all of our businesses, and sets out policies, risk assessments, du e\\ndiligence processes and controls and training, including targeted train ing and mandatory annual training for all employees. BMO’s compliance prog ram\\napplies data analytics, technology and professional expertise in order to deter, detect and report suspicious activity. BMO has implemented a\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 101\\n\\n\\n## Page 90\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nKnow-Your-Customer program which aims to understand who its customers ar e, as well as the beneficial ownership of entities holding BMO products. In\\naddition, customers and transactions are routinely screened against curre nt sanctions, terrorist and other designated watch lists. The CAMLO repo rts\\nregularly to the Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Boar d of Directors and to senior management on the effectiveness of the\\ncompliance program. The effectiveness of our AML/ATF and sanctions comp liance program is subject to regular review and independent assessment by\\nthe Corporate Audit Division. We remain committed to effective com pliance and the ongoing effort to protect the financial system.\\nArtificial Intelligence Risk\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) risk arises from the development, implementation and incorrect or biased use of AI systems, including machine learnin g\\n(ML) and generative AI system outputs, which may lead to financial loss, poor customer experiences and damage to our reputation.\\nThe AI capabilities available to the industry have been evolving at unprecedented speed, highlighting new opportunities for innovation across a\\nbroad range of products and services. AI is expected to become a key driver of future operating efficiencies, but only if we adopt and integrate newtechnologies in a safe and responsible manner. Our use of AI has the potential to pose risks to the organization that overlap existing riskmanagement frameworks (e.g., model risk). These AI risks may be exacerbated by the scale, scope and processing speed of AI, or can take novelforms. In addition, the use of AI outside of BMO can complicate the threat landscape and could impact other risk frameworks which are evolving tomeet these more complex threats.\\nOur management and oversight of AI risk, including risks arising from the use of generative AI, are consistent with our ERMF, employ our three-\\nlines-of-defence model and consider industry standard frameworks and existing regulatory requirements such as privacy laws. Significant AIinitiatives are reviewed by a cross-functional group before implementation, which considers potential risks and adverse impacts, including unfai ro r\\nbiased output from AI systems, and measures to mitigate such risks. We are focused on advancing our commitment to serving our customers in a waythat fosters confidence and trust in our fair, secure, transparent and ethical use of these technologies, utilizing our risk management practices, o ur\\nglobal privacy principles and our internal safeguards, such as oversight, monitoring and testing, to employ AI responsibly. Our approach to theresponsible use of AI, including generative AI, continues to evolve and adapt to ongoing regulatory developments in the jurisdictions in which weoperate.\\nBusiness Continuity Risk\\nBusiness continuity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to maintain, continue or restore essential business operations during and /\\nor after an event that prevents BMO from conducting business in the normal course.\\nBusiness continuity management should enable BMO to recover, maintain and manage critical processes, as well as safeguard the interests and\\nwell-being of our customers, shareholders and employees. In the event of an operational disruption, effective business continuity plans aim tominimize adverse impacts on our customers, employees and other interested parties. These operational disruptions could result from severe weather ,\\ntechnology failures, cyber attacks or any other event that can lead to process failure. We have a framework in place that facilitates the rapid recover y\\nand timely resumption of critical operations, including availability of our people, processes, facilities and technology, and maintenance of our t hird-\\nparty relationships. Our comprehensive business continuity management strategy involves developing, testing and maintaining recovery strategi es\\nand plans with the objective that critical processes and third-party relationships remain resilient throughout any disruption.\\nCyber and Information Security Risk\\nCyber and information security risk arises from the possibility that BMO’s business could be materially affected by security incidents, including t he\\nloss, theft or misuse of information, including all types of data (e.g., client data, employee data and the organization’s proprietary data), as well as\\nany potential failure to comply with rules concerning information or cyber security. We are the target of attempted cyber attacks and mustcontinuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure, as well as access to and th e\\nsecurity of our data. Any resulting data breaches may lead to exposure or loss of data, including customer or employee information and the bank’sstrategic or other sensitive internal information, and could result in identity theft, fraud or business losses. Cyber attacks could result in syste m\\nfailures and disruption of services, and expose the bank to litigation and regulatory risk, as well as reputational harm. Threat campaigns are becomi ng\\nmore sophisticated and well-organized, and often take place through third-party suppliers, which can negatively impact our business, brand andreputation, as well as customer retention and acquisition. Due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective serviceproviders), central agents, exchanges, clearing-houses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of these are subjec tt oa\\nsuccessful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the thirdparty or result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client, employee or other confidential information, which could interrupt our business an d\\nadversely affect our operations and reputation.\\nCyber and information security is critical to the delivery of the bank’s strategies, initiatives and goals. As technology evolves rapidly and the\\nconnective capabilities of digital devices continue to grow, cyber threats and risks also evolve. These threats include breaches of, or disruptions to,\\nour systems or operations, as well as unauthorized access to, or use or dissemination of, information pertaining to BMO, our customers or employees.At BMO, our response includes investing in our Financial Crimes Unit and technological infrastructure, equipping our team to detect and address cybe r\\nsecurity threats across North America, Europe and Asia. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not beable to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, as the techniques used are increasingly sophistic ated,\\nchange frequently and are often not recognized until launched. As a result of these risks, we could become subject to legal or regulatory action,reputational and operational harm, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against, or not fully covered through any insurancemaintained by BMO.\\n102 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 91\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Data and Analytics Risk\\nData and analytics risk arises from the possibility of loss or harm from the inadequate or failed identification, management, accuracy or timeliness of\\nstructured or unstructured data used to support business processes and decision-making, including analytics. Data quality, governance andarchitecture impact our understanding and management of BMO’s data assets and the data quality of analytical output.\\nWe continue to invest in new capabilities in support of BMO’s digital transformation. Our ability to effectively manage and safeguard critical data\\nhas a direct impact on our successful deployment of digital processes and our ability to develop and introduce innovative new capabilities with toolsand systems driven by AI. Our management of data and analytics risk is focused on the quality, resilience, retention and governance of BMO’s dataassets, which are foundational to our business operations, strategy and future growth, including BMO’s Digital First strategy.\\nFraud and Physical Security Risk\\nFraud risk arises from the possibility that an intentional act, misstatement or omission designed to deceive others may result in the intended targetexperiencing a loss or the perpetrator achieving a gain. Fraud may be perpetrated by our employees, suppliers or other external parties, includingBMO customers. Fraudsters continue to target the financial industry with increasingly sophisticated methods that facilitate fraud and remit funds to\\nfraudulent accounts. BMO maintains a Fraud Risk Management program intended to proactively manage fraud risks across the bank.\\nThe management of physical security risk seeks to ensure that the bank, its customers, employees and third parties are protected against the risk\\nof loss, interference, unauthorized physical access, damage or injury to which they may be exposed as a result of the bank’s operations. Physicalsecurity risks may emerge through various threat vectors, including criminal activities, terrorist attacks, sociopolitical unrest, human error, natural\\ndisasters and/or geopolitical threats. Physical security measures may also support the management of other risks, including risks related toinformation security, privacy and fraud.\\nProject and Change Management Risk\\nProject and change management risk is the risk of loss arising from the possibility that BMO could experience a loss due to substandard delivery of aninitiative that may result in the business not achieving its intended outcome, as well as attracting additional regulatory scrutiny.\\nThe bank has established a Project and Change Management Risk Framework to drive consistency in the delivery of an initiative within a\\nprescribed control environment. This framework outlines the principles and processes for providing governance, monitoring and reporting, as well as\\nthe roles and responsibilities necessary to address project and change management risk across the enterprise in order to meet or exceed theexpectations of interested parties.\\nTechnology Risk\\nTechnology risk, including risks related to emerging technology and digital platforms, is the possibility that the inadequacy, misuse, disruption or\\nfailure of information technology systems, infrastructure or data could result in an inability to meet business needs. Technology risk managementmeasures are intended to protect BMO’s systems, data and assets, and help safeguard their confidentiality, integrity and availability. As the adopt ion\\nof digital banking channels continues to grow, we continue to invest in new and innovative technological capabilities in order to meet our customers’expectations and keep their data secure. In alignment with our operational risk management framework, we follow a program that addressesexposures to technology risk, supported by a team of technology risk management experts.\\nThird-Party Risk\\nThird-party risk is the risk of loss associated with an entity failing to provide goods, business activities, functions and/or services, failing to p rotect\\ndata or systems of the bank, or exposing BMO to other negative outcomes. BMO’s third-party risk management (TPRM) framework sets therequirements for the identification, assessment, management, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of third-party risk across the third-party li fe cycle.\\nThis framework is supported by a centrally maintained TPRM program.\\nWe continue to enhance and evolve our capabilities in order to maintain robust risk management practices, support operational resilience\\nobjectives and comply with regulatory requirements.\\nFor further discussion of third-party risk, refer to the Cyber and Information Security section.\\nModel Risk\\nModel Risk is the potential for adverse outcomes resulting from decisions that are based on incorrect or misused model results. These adverse\\noutcomes can include financial loss, poor business decision-making and damage to reputation.\\nModel risk arises from the use of quantitative analytical tools that apply statistical, mathematical, economic, algorithmic or other advanced\\ntechniques, such as AI and ML, to process input data and generate quantitative output or estimates. These analytical tools range from very simplequantitative methods that produce straightforward estimates to highly sophisticated models that can be used to value complex transactions orprovide a broad range of forward-looking estimates. These analytical tools generate results that can inform business, risk and capital managementdecision-making, and assist in making daily lending, trading, underwriting, funding, investment and operational decisions.\\nThese analytical tools provide important insights and are effective when used within a framework that identifies key assumptions and\\nlimitations, while controlling and mitigating model risk. In addition to applying judgment to evaluate the reliability of model results, we mitigat e\\nmodel risk by maintaining strong controls over the development, validation, implementation and use of all models across the enterprise. We alsoseek to ensure that other analytical tools, including critical calculations and other estimation approaches, such as model overlays used for keybusiness decision-making, are intuitive, experience-based, well-documented and subject to effective challenge by employees, who have sufficien t\\nexpertise and knowledge in order to deliver reasonable results.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 103\\n\\n\\n## Page 92\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nModel Risk Management Framework\\nRisk is inherent in models because model results are estimates that rely on statistical, mathematical or other quantitative techniques to approxima te\\nreality and transform data into estimates or forecasts of future outcomes. Model risk also arises from the potential misuse of models or model results .\\nModel risk is governed at BMO by a risk-based enterprise-wide Model Risk Management Framework.\\nInitiation &\\nIdentification123 67 4Model Life Cycle\\nDevelopment Validation ImplementationUse &\\nMaintenanceOngoing\\nMonitoring\\n& ValidationDecommission5\\nThe Model Risk Management Framework sets out an end-to-end approach for model risk governance across the model life cycle and for the\\nmanagement of model risk within the limits of our risk appetite. The framework includes BMO’s Model Risk Corporate Policy, Model Risk Guidelinesand supporting operating procedures, which outline the governing principles for managing model risk, describe model risk management processes indetail and define the roles and responsibilities of interested parties across the model life cycle. Model owners, developers and users serve as the fi rst\\nline of defence, while the Model Risk Management group is the second line of defence and the Corporate Audit Division is the third line of defence.\\nOur Model Risk Management group is responsible for developing and maintaining our Model Risk Management Framework in alignment with\\nregulatory expectations, as well as for exercising oversight of the effectiveness of model processes, model inventory and the overall aggregation,assessment and reporting of model risk. This framework incorporates guidance on the management of risks, the safe and responsible adoption ofadvances in automation used for decision-making, such as large language models and algorithmic trading, as well as other AI and ML applications. Ourenterprise Model Risk Management Committee (MRMC), a sub-committee of the RMC, is a cross-functional group representing interested parties acrossthe enterprise. The MRMC meets regularly to help direct BMO’s use of models, oversee the development, implementation and maintenance of theModel Risk Management Framework, provide effective challenge and discuss governance of the enterprise’s models.\\nOutcomes Analysis and Back-TestingOnce models are validated, approved and in use, they are subject to ongoing monitoring, including outcomes analysis, at varying frequencies. As akey component of outcomes analysis, back-testing compares model results against actual observed outcomes. Variances between model forecastsand actual observed outcomes are measured against defined risk materiality thresholds and tolerance ranges, which may result in further steps beingtaken, such as model review and parameter recalibration, as appropriate. This analysis serves to confirm the validity of a model’s performance overtime. Controls are in place to address identified issues and enhance our models’ overall performance.\\nAll models used within BMO, including models that incorporate AI and ML techniques, are subject to validation and ongoing monitoring to\\nconfirm that they are being used in alignment with our framework and in compliance with regulatory expectations, such as those related to ethics,privacy, fairness and explainability. This framework applies to a wide variety of models, ranging from market, credit and non-financial risk models to\\nstress testing, pricing and valuation, and anti-money laundering models.\\nCautionThis Operational Non-Financial Risk section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Stateme nts.\\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\\nLegal and Regulatory Risk is the potential for loss or harm resulting from failure to comply with laws or satisfy contractual obligations or\\nregulatory requirements. This includes the risk arising from any failure to: comply with the law (in letter or in spirit) or maintain standards of care ;\\nimplement legal or regulatory requirements; enforce or comply with contractual terms; assert non-contractual rights; effectively manage dispute s;\\nor act in a manner so as to maintain our reputation.\\nThe success of BMO’s business operations relies in part on our ability to manage our exposure to legal and regulatory risk. The financial services\\nindustry is highly regulated and subject to strict enforcement of legal and regulatory requirements. Banks globally continue to be subject to fines a nd\\nother penalties for a number of regulatory and conduct issues. We are exposed to risks in connection with regulatory and governmental inquiries,investigations and enforcement actions, as well as criminal prosecutions. As rulemaking and supervisory expectations continue to evolve, we monit or\\ndevelopments to enable BMO to respond by implementing changes as required.\\nUnder the direction of BMO’s General Counsel, our Legal & Regulatory Compliance group maintains enterprise-wide frameworks that set out the\\nsteps to be taken to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on exposure to legal and regulatory risk. We identify applicable laws andregulations and potential risks, recommend mitigation measures and strategies, conduct internal investigations, and oversee legal proceedings a nd\\nenforcement actions, including civil claims and litigation, criminal charges, and regulatory examinations and audits.\\nHeightened regulatory and supervisory scrutiny has a significant impact on the way we conduct business. Working with the operating groups and\\nCorporate Services, Legal & Regulatory Compliance assesses and analyzes the implications of changes in regulatory and supervisory expectations. W e\\ndevote substantial resources to the implementation of systems and processes required to comply with new regulations. Failure to comply withapplicable legal and regulatory requirements may lead to legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions or fines, enforcement actions ,\\ncriminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in investor and cus tomer\\nconfidence, and damage to our reputation. Certain businesses are also subject to fiduciary requirements, including policies and practices that add ress\\nthe responsibilities of a business to a customer, such as service requirements and expectations, customer suitability determinations, disclosureobligations and communications.\\n104 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 93\\n\\n                          MD&A                          BMO is subject to legal proceedings, including investigations by regulators, arising in the ordinary course of business, and the unfavourable\\nresolution of any such legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow s,\\ncapital position or credit ratings; require material changes in our operations; result in operational restrictions or an inability to execute certa in business\\nstrategies; result in loss of customers; and damage our reputation. The volume of legal proceedings and the amount of damages and penaltiesassessed in such legal proceedings could grow in the future. Information regarding material legal proceedings to which we are a party is included inthe Legal Proceedings section in Note 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intend ed\\nto provide reasonable assurance that relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, so that appropriatedecisions can be made regarding public disclosure. In assessing the materiality of legal proceedings, factors considered include a case-by-caseassessment of specific facts and circumstances, our past experience and the opinions of legal experts. However, some legal proceedings may behighly complex, and may include novel or untested legal claims or theories. The outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to anticipate until latein the proceedings, which may last several years.\\nBMO’s Anti-Corruption Office, through its global program, has articulated key principles and procedures that support the effective oversight of\\ncompliance with anti-corruption legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These include guidance on identifying, avoiding and reporti ng on\\ncorrupt practices and rigorously investigating allegations of corrupt activity. Evolving competition or antitrust risk is managed globally throu gh BMO’s\\nCompetition/Antitrust Office, which is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of a compliance program that supports theoversight of competition/antitrust laws or regulatory expectations.\\nGovernments and regulators around the world continue to focus on anti-mon ey laundering and related concerns, raising their expectations for the\\nquality and efficacy of anti-money laundering programs and penalizing i nstitutions that fail to meet these expectations. Failure to meet these\\nexpectations may lead to legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions or fines, enforcement actions, criminal convictions and penal ties,\\noperational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business stra tegies, a decline in investor and customer confidence, and damage to our\\nreputation. Under the direction of the Chief Anti-Money Laundering Offi cer (CAMLO), BMO’s Anti-Money Laundering Office is responsible for the\\nassessment, governance and oversight of the principles and procedures th at support the effective oversight of compliance with laws and regulations\\nand internal risk parameters related to anti-money laundering, anti-terr orist financing and sanctions measures. For further discussion, refer to the\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Management – Anti-Money Lau ndering, Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Risk section.\\nBMO has built its reputation on a strong foundation of ethical business practices, a client service culture and our track record of responsible risk\\nmanagement. We have adopted a wide range of practices, in addition to BMO’s Code of Conduct, to support the ethical conduct of our employees andBoard of Directors and mitigate the risk of potential misconduct. Misconduct is behaviour that falls short of legal, professional, internal conduct and\\nethical standards. Acting with integrity and competing ethically and responsibly support our focus on maintaining a strong risk culture. For furthe r\\ndiscussion, refer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework – Risk Culture section.\\nAll of these frameworks reflect the three-lines-of-defence operating model described previously. The operating groups and Corporate Services\\nmanage day-to-day risks by implementing and monitoring corporate policies and standards, while Legal & Regulatory Compliance units specificallyassigned to each of the operating groups provide advice and independent legal and regulatory risk management oversight.\\nThe General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer regularly report to the Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Board of\\nDirectors and senior management on the effectiveness of our enterprise compliance program. The program takes a risk-based approach to identify,assess and manage any risks related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and directs operating groups and Corporate Services tomaintain policies, procedures and controls that address these laws and regulations. Under the direction of the Chief Compliance Officer, we identif y\\nand report on gaps and deficiencies, and we track remedial action plans. The CAMLO also regularly reports to the ACRC.\\nAll BMO employees must regularly complete legal and regulatory training on topics such as anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, competition/\\nantitrust and privacy policies, standards and directives. This is carried out in conjunction with our Code of Conduct training, which tests employee s’\\nknowledge and understanding of the behaviour required of BMO employees.\\nWe continue to respond to other global regulatory developments, including the impact of changes in capital and liquidity requirements.

Globally, we are also tracking theemergence and finalization of formal supervisory regulatory frameworks governing the analysis and reporting of risks related to sustainability an d\\nclimate change, including frameworks in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. In addition, current and emergingregulatory requirements in certain U.S. states may apply restrictions or sanctions on financial institutions that impose any environmental standa rds\\nthat exceed the legal or regulatory requirements of the states in which they operate. Trends in litigation and regulatory investigation are evolving ,\\nand legislation and regulatory guidance pertaining to disclosure practices or financing activities related to climate or sustainability matters, as well as\\nallegations of “greenwashing”, also continue to evolve. We are monitoring these trends and assessing their potential impact in the context of BMO’sclimate-related sustainable finance and responsible investment activities, environmental and social risk management, and disclosure practices related\\nto climate or sustainability matters.

In Canada, there is continuing focus on requiring financial institutions to support mortgage holders at risk, asoutlined in the federal government’s Canadian Mortgage Charter. In addition, the government is taking steps to reduce the costs of banking, includin g\\nby lowering banking fees, through a cap on non-sufficient funds fees, which will reduce our fee revenue when implemented. Several provinces arealso enhancing protections for consumers, including such areas as consumer fraud, through legislative changes to their consumer protection regime s.\\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators adopted changes to harmonize and enhance reporting of theongoing costs, including embedded fees, of owning investment funds and segregated funds. In the United States, banking regulators have aheightened focus on matters pertaining to racial equity, financial inclusion and consumer protection, including the impact on consumers from fraud or\\nprocesses to protect consumers from fraud. Key consumer concerns, including fair lending and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, are nowsubject to heightened regulatory scrutiny in bank examination programs. In both Canada and the United States, there is a growing focus on consumerdata rights and both jurisdictions have started to introduce regulatory frameworks for open banking that will require banks to share data, aspermitted by consumers, with authorized third parties.\\nPrivacy\\nProtection of personal information is critical to maintaining the trust of our customers. Our handling of personal information is increasingly impo rtant\\nas we continue to drive our Digital First strategy. There is a growing focus on regulation related to privacy and the use and safeguarding of personalinformation, and we continue to advance our privacy program to comply with new and amended legislation where we do business. In Canada,significant reform to federal privacy laws is expected under Bill C-27, including new regulatory powers and penalties and additional legislation toaddress the use of artificial intelligence. In Quebec, Law 25 (previously Bill 64) came into effect in three phases, beginning in fiscal 2021 and endin g\\nin September 2024. Law 25 modernizes the province’s private-sector privacy regime, introduces new regulations related to biometrics and automateddecisions, and gives new powers to regulators to impose monetary administrative penalties. Outside of Canada, large fines and settlements havebeen imposed for breaches of privacy rights and failure to comply with regulatory privacy requirements – evidence of heightened regulatory vigilanc e\\nand enforcement. The California Consumer Privacy Act was enhanced and amended in 2023 by the California Privacy Rights Act , which includes new\\nand expanded privacy rights for California residents. Other states have introduced privacy legislation, which is leading to a growing patchwork ofprivacy laws in the United States. In the European Union and the United Kingdom, there are ongoing concerns regarding the transfer of personal datato countries lacking adequate privacy protection. Privacy-related risks, including risks of privacy breaches, have escalated as a result of the thr eat\\nlandscape. For further discussion, refer to the Top and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results – Cyber and Information Security Risk section an d\\nthe Operational Non-Financial Risk – Cyber and Information Security Risk section.\\nU.S. Regulatory Developments\\nThere are several pending regulatory rules that will likely impact BMO’s U.S. operations, including the following:\\n‰Capital: In July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued new rule proposals that would revise the regulatory capital framework for large bank holdingcompanies and their depository institutions, including BMO Financial Corp. (BFC), BMO’s U.S. holding company, and BMO Bank N.A. These proposalswould implement the risk-based capital standards contained in the Basel III Reforms (referred to as Basel III Endgame) published by the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision. On September 10, 2024, the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the proposed rules will be revised andre-issued as a new proposal.\\n‰Long-term debt: In August 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a new rule proposal that would require large banks with total assetsof $100 billion or more to maintain a layer of long-term debt, which would improve financial stability by increasing the resolvability and resilienceof such institutions.\\nThe impact of these proposed rules on our results will depend on the final rules issued by the U.S. banking agencies. We currently do not expect a\\nmaterial change to our enterprise-level funding activities if these rules are enacted as proposed.\\nBFC is regulated as a Category III firm under the Enhanced Prudential Standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Additional information\\nregarding regulatory requirements that apply to BFC is set out in the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section.\\nCautionThis Legal and Regulatory Risk section contains forward-looking statements.

The impact of this risk can be limited through an effective strategic risk management framework and stress testing.\\nBMO’s Corporate Strategy group oversees the strategic planning process and works with the lines of business and Corporate Services to identify,\\nmonitor and mitigate risks across the enterprise. Our rigorous strategic risk management framework encourages a consistent approach in thedevelopment of strategic plans through an integrated, multi-year strategic and financial planning process, in alignment with our enterprise riskappetite.\\nThe framework promotes consistency and adherence to management standards, including a consideration of the results of stress testing as an\\ninput into our decision-making. The potential impacts of changes in the business environment, including macroeconomic developments, broadindustry trends, the actions of existing and new competitors and regulatory developments, are considered in this process and inform decision-makin g\\nwithin each line of business. Oversight of strategic risk is the responsibility of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. This is carried out\\nthrough an annual review of enterprise and operating group strategies, which involves interactive sessions that challenge assumptions and thestrategies in the context of both the current and potential future business environment. Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management reviews businessstrategies to confirm that they are developed and executed in accordance with the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework and are within ourestablished risk appetite, tolerances and limits. Where required, these strategies are revised to address new or unexpected developments.\\nStrategic risk also includes business risk arising from specific enterprise activities and the effects these could have on earnings. Within BMO, eac h\\noperating group is responsible for controlling its respective business risk by assessing, managing and mitigating risks. To manage exposure totransverse business risks (i.e., those spanning multiple lines of business, such as climate change), the Corporate Strategy group works in tandem wi th\\nthe relevant business partners to shape effective mitigation approaches.\\nOur ability to implement the strategic plans developed by management influences our financial performance. Performance objectives are\\nestablished through the strategic planning process and our progress toward those objectives is monitored regularly and reported on quarterly, usin g\\nboth leading and lagging indicators of absolute and relative performance, so that strategies can be reviewed and adjusted where necessary. Regularstrategic and financial updates are also reviewed closely in order to identify any significant emerging risk issues.\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk is the potential for loss or harm directly or indirectly resulting from environmental and social factors that impact\\nBMO or its customers, and BMO’s impact on the environment and society.\\nIn recognition of its unique characteristics, environmental and social (E&S) risk is classified in BMO’s Risk Taxonomy as a transverse risk that may\\nmanifest itself through other risk types, namely credit and counterparty risk, market risk, insurance risk, liquidity and funding risk, operationa l\\nnon-financial risk, legal and regulatory risk, strategic risk and reputation risk. E&S risk may arise over a range of time frames, from short-term tolong-term. Factors that may give rise to E&S risk include, but are not limited to: climate change; pollution and waste; the use of energy, water andother resources; biodiversity and land use; human rights; diversity, equity and inclusion; labour standards; community health, safety and securit y; land\\nacquisition and involuntary resettlement; Indigenous peoples’ rights; and cultural heritage. We are advancing our risk identification efforts by defining\\nthese factors and identifying any risk exposures that may be affected by the transverse impact of these factors.\\nWe recognize that climate change involves exposure to physical and transition risks. Physical risks are associated with a changing climate, which\\ncan have both acute and chronic physical effects. These risks may include an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather-related events, suchas storms, floods, wildfires and heatwaves, or longer-term changes, such as temperature changes, rising sea levels and changes in soil productivity .\\nTo date, key climate change indicators, weather-related events and associated scientific research indicate that global exposure to climate change risks\\nappears to be accelerating. Transition risks are associated with the shift to a net zero carbon economy. These risks may arise from climate-relatedpolicy changes, technological changes and behavioural changes involving carbon-pricing mechanisms, or a shift in consumer preferences towardlower-carbon products and services. We continue to closely monitor these changes, some of which may unfold more rapidly than others asconsumers, clients, investors, governments and communities act to enhance their resilience to climate-related risks.\\nWe may have direct exposure to E&S risk associated with the ownership and operation of BMO’s businesses. We may be indirectly exposed to the\\nrisk of financial loss or reputational harm if our customers or suppliers are affected by E&S factors or are associated with adverse environmental orsocial impacts to such an extent that they are unable to meet their financial or other obligations to us, or cause reputational risks for BMO. E&S factor s\\nmay also give rise to the risk of reputational harm if we are perceived to not respond effectively to those factors, or to cause, contribute or be linkedto adverse impacts on the environment or society, as discussed in the Reputation Risk section.\\nGovernance\\nThe Board of Directors, through the Risk Review Committee (RRC), approves the E&S Risk Appetite Statement and the E&S Risk Corporate Policy, asdiscussed below. The RRC assists the Board of Directors in meeting its oversight responsibilities for the identification, assessment and managemen to f\\nour exposure to E&S risk, including risks arising from climate change, for the overall adherence to risk management corporate policies, and forcomplying with risk-related regulatory requirements. The Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) assesses the effectiveness of BMO’sgovernance of sustainability matters and approves BMO’s sustainability reporting and disclosures, including our Sustainability Report and Publi c\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 107\\n\\n\\n## Page 96\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAccountability Statement, and our Climate Report. The Human Resources Committee has responsibility for the alignment of executive compensation\\nwith performance, including performance in relation to BMO’s environmental and social objectives. The Governance and Nominating Committeeregularly reviews the charters of our Board of Directors and its committees to assess the coverage and alignment of their responsibilities foroverseeing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues with their respective mandates.\\nBMO’s General Counsel is the bank’s Executive Committee Sponsor for Sustainability and Climate, and has accountability for legal and regulatory\\nrisk, reputation risk, business conduct and ethics, and sustainability, including climate change. Our ESG Executive Committee comprises executiv e\\ncommittee members from the lines of business and Corporate Services, and provides oversight and leadership for our sustainability strategy,including our Climate Ambition. In addition to the ESG Executive Committee, BMO has a Sustainability Council which acts as a leadership forum foradvancing sustainability initiatives. Senior management oversees E&S risk through management committees and forums that provide oversight andreceive updates on sustainability matters and E&S risk. These include, but are not limited to: Disclosure Committee, Risk Management Committee(RMC), Reputation Risk Management Committee (RRMC), Enterprise Regulatory Committee, Climate Commercialization Working Group and ImpactInvestment Fund Committee, as well as the Investment Committee of BMO Global Asset Management. Additional committees, forums and workinggroups may be established as needed. In addition, the Board of Directors and any management committees active in other jurisdictions receiveupdates and oversee E&S risk for the relevant jurisdiction. They also receive updates on sustainability matters and E&S risk across the enterprise.\\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO), as Head of Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM), and supported by the Risk Executive Committee, acts\\nas the second line of defence on the transverse impacts of E&S risk on credit and counterparty risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, insurancerisk and operational non-financial risk; oversees risk appetite for E&S risk in the context of these risks; and reports to the Board of Directors, its R RC\\nand the RMC on E&S risk.\\nStrategy\\nOur climate ambition is to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world. This ambition is explicitly linked to our enterprisecommercial strategy, and we are working to realize this ambition through a four-pillar climate strategy: Commitment; Capabilities; Client partner ship\\nand commercialization; and Convening for climate action. Our strategy seeks to capture commercialization opportunities by working with our client s\\non their decarbonization journeys. The strategy is being implemented by our operating groups, overseen by the ESG Executive Committee andsupported by the BMO Climate Institute, which serves as an enterprise resource to accelerate BMO’s climate-related transition efforts and as aninternal and external convenor on climate action.\\nIn order to remain informed about emerging E&S risks, we participate in global forums with other financial institutions and maintain an open\\ndialogue with other external parties.\\nE&S Risk Management\\nA successful future for BMO and our customers depends on the sustainability of the environment, communities and economies in which we operate.We seek to understand the impact that E&S risk factors could have on our business environment, as well as on our clients, portfolios and operations.With this understanding, we are better positioned to make informed strategic decisions.\\nOur E&S Risk Corporate Policy, applicable to all BMO employees, sets out our approach to integrating E&S risk into the Enterprise-Wide Risk\\nManagement Framework (ERMF). The policy affirms the expectation of our Board of Directors that BMO will integrate considerations of E&S risk acrossthe ERMF, including risks arising from climate change. It is supported by BMO’s three-lines-of-defence operating model and is underpinned by our ris k\\nculture. Its implementation involves building new capabilities, while also leveraging our existing risk governance provisions and resources, to i dentify,\\nassess, manage, monitor and report on potential impacts on our clients, portfolios and operations. The E&S Risk Corporate Policy is complemented bytwo enterprise-wide policy documents: a Climate Risk Corporate Standard to enable effective climate risk management and support legal andregulatory compliance, and an E&S Risk Management Framework Directive, which supports implementation of the corporate policy.\\nWe have developed a qualitative Risk Appetite Statement that includes E&S risks, including risks related to climate change. In addition, we have\\nenhanced a transition key risk metric with risk tolerance thresholds, which measures our credit risk exposure in support of carbon-related assets as a\\npercentage of our total credit risk exposure. In parallel, we have also included a key risk indicator to quantify BMO’s exposure to physical risks offlooding, and will continue to expand and enhance these key risk metrics and indicators as appropriate to monitor climate risk concentrations.\\nE&S risk is also addressed in our Credit Risk Management Framework, including provisions for governance and accountabilities, enhanced due\\ndiligence and thresholds for escalations or exceptions. Sector-specific financing guidelines help us identify and manage exposure to E&S risk in hi gher-\\nrisk sectors and integrate consideration of these risks into our decision-making, which also considers factors such as climate change and Indigenou s\\nconsultation. The E&S Risk General Financing Guideline is an enterprise-level second-line directive that applies to wholesale lending transactio ns;\\narticulates our lending risk appetite for E&S risk, outlines the enhanced due diligence process, supported by E&S Risk Rating (ESRR) assessment tool s\\ndeveloped to address sectors with heightened risk and outlines lending considerations, escalations and elevations. The E&S Risk General FinancingGuideline includes direction on developing an understanding of the specific impacts of climate change on borrowers and their operations, includingregulatory and/or legislative changes.\\nWe maintain a diversified lending portfolio to limit our exposure to any one sector or geographic region that might be vulnerable to climate-\\nrelated risk, and we continue to conduct sector-specific reviews across our lending portfolio to assess exposure to climate-sensitive industries. Social\\nand environmental requirements in financing arrangements and transactions are monitored by the lines of business as part of our overall monitoringprocess. Transactions involving significant environmental or social concerns may be escalated to the RRMC for consideration.\\nWe are continuing to develop our climate scenario analysis program to explore climate-specific vulnerabilities and enhance our resilience to\\nclimate-related risks, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The climate scenario an alysis\\nprogram leverages existing risk capabilities in combination with climate-specific expertise, tools and data. This program includes the evaluatio no f\\ntransition risks and physical risks through comprehensive climate-based scenarios across portfolios and risk types, and also considers integrati on of\\nscenario impacts at the enterprise level. This capability enables the bank to execute on regulatory scenario analysis, such as the Standardized Clim ate\\n108 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 97\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Scenario Exercise from OSFI. These analyses help to identify potential exposures and concentrations to short-, medium- and long-term climate risks\\nand may inform our business strategy in relation to climate change going forward. For example, we have identified the channels through whichclimate risk manifests itself in credit, market, operational, liquidity and insurance risk. In addition, we have developed an integrated loss asses sment\\napproach for incorporating climate risk within the bank’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\\nWe continue to assess the credibility, reliability, comparability and decision-making usefulness of various measurement, assessment and\\nreporting approaches, as well as the ways in which we could incorporate them into our climate risk management program and associated disclosures.\\nManaging E&S Risk in the Supply Chain\\nOur Sustainability group partners with the Procurement and Corporate Real Estate groups on operational sustainability. Together, these groups areresponsible for establishing and maintaining an operational environmental management approach, including the application of the framework set ou t\\nin ISO 14001 across our essential facilities, and for setting objectives and targets that are intended to align our operations with our sustainabilit y\\nperformance goals.\\nBMO’s Code of Conduct has been approved by our Board of Directors, and reflects our commitment to manage our business responsibly. We\\nreport publicly under the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 2015 , the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 and Canada’s Fighting Against Forced\\nLabour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act , and we have in place a Supplier Code of Conduct which outlines our standards for integrity, fair dealing\\nand sustainability. We require our suppliers to be aware of, understand and comply with the principles of our Supplier Code of Conduct.\\nBMO’s disclosures will be updated to meet any evolution in the expectations of pertinent legislation, in accordance with applicable timelines.\\nRegulatory Developments\\nE&S-related regulations, frameworks and guidance are rapidly evolving and we continue to monitor such developments, updating our riskmanagement practices and disclosures as necessary.\\nIn March 2024, OSFI released updates to Guideline B-15, Climate Risk Management to align with the International Sustainability Standards\\nBoard’s final IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures , standard. We incorporated these updates into our implementation plans for the first set of\\ndisclosures, effective the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after the fiscal year-end, as well a s\\nthe second phase of disclosure requirements that will be effective the fiscal year ending October 31, 2025.\\nWe are also assessing the impact of the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires disclosure across\\nvarious sustainability topics, as detailed in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards.\\nMetrics and Targets\\nOur reporting on climate-related metrics and targets includes a discussion of BMO’s Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, calculated usingthe GHG Protocol, and a discussion of our Scope 3 emissions, calculated using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). More detaileddiscussion, as well as a discussion of financed emissions targets for certain sectors, can be found in the Climate Report. The BMO Sustainability Repo rt\\nand Climate Report contain metrics, including the tracking of sustainable finance, which are relevant for sustainability purposes but may not bedirectly related to net zero goals or emissions reductions outcomes. The shareholders’ auditors provide a limited assurance report on selectedenvironmental and social indicators in the Sustainability Report and Climate Report.\\nCautionThis Environmental and Social Risk section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statement s.\\nReputation Risk\\nReputation Risk is the potential for loss or harm to the BMO brand. It can arise even if other risks are managed effectively.\\nOur reputation is built on our commitment to high standards of business conduct and is one of our most valuable assets. By protecting and\\nmaintaining our reputation, we safeguard our brand, increase shareholder value, reduce our cost of capital, improve employee engagement andpreserve our customers’ loyalty and trust.\\nWe manage risks to our reputation by considering the potential reputational impact of all business activities, including strategy development and\\nimplementation, transactions and initiatives, data and technology use (including artificial intelligence), product and service offerings, and e vents or\\nincidents impacting BMO, as well as day-to-day decision-making and conduct. We consider our reputation in everything that we do.\\nBMO’s Code of Conduct is the foundation of our ethical culture, and it provides employees with guidance on the behaviour that is expected of\\nthem, so that they can make the right choice when making a decision. Ongoing reinforcement of the commitments set out in the Code of Conductminimizes risks to our reputation that may result from inappropriate behaviour or poor decision-making. Recognizing that non-financial risks can h ave\\na negative impact as significant as the effect of financial risks, we actively promote a culture in which employees are encouraged to raise concernsand are supported in doing so, with zero tolerance for retaliation.\\nIn our corporate governance practices and Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework, we have specific controls in place to manage risks to\\nour reputation. We seek to identify activities or events that could impact our reputation with customers, regulators or other interested parties. Wh ere\\nwe identify a potential risk to our reputation, we take steps to assess and manage that risk. Instances of significant or heightened exposure toreputation risk are escalated to BMO’s Reputation Risk Management Committee (RRMC) for review. As misconduct can impact our reputation, theChief Ethics Officer, who is responsible for enterprise-wide reporting on employee conduct, may escalate instances of misconduct involving signif icant\\nreputation risk to BMO’s RRMC for review, as appropriate.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 109\\n\\n\\n## Page 98\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAccounting Matters and Disclosure and Internal Control\\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\\nThe most significant assets and liabilities for which we must make estimates and judgments include: allowance for credit losses; financial instrume nts\\nmeasured at fair value; pension and other employee future benefits; impairment of securities and investments in associates and joint ventures;income taxes and deferred tax assets; goodwill and intangible assets; insurance contract liabilities; provisions, including legal proceedings an d\\nrestructuring charges; transfers of financial assets; consolidation of structured entities (SEs); and valuation of the Bank of the West assets acqu ired and\\nliabilities assumed. We make judgments in assessing the business model for financial assets, as well as whether substantially all risks and rewardshave been transferred in respect of transfers of financial assets and whether we control structured entities. These judgments are discussed in Notes 6\\nand 7 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements. Note 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements provides furtherdetails on the estimates and judgments made in determining the fair value of financial instruments. If actual results were to differ from theseestimates, the impact would be recorded in future periods.\\nBy their nature, the judgments and estimates that we make for the purposes of preparing financial statements relate to matters that are\\ninherently uncertain. However, we have detailed policies and control procedures in place that are intended to ensure the judgments made inestimating these amounts are well-controlled, independently reviewed and consistently applied from period to period. We believe that the estimate s\\nof the values of our assets and liabilities are appropriate.\\nFor a more detailed discussion of the use of estimates, refer to Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\nThe allowance for credit losses primarily consists of allowances for impaired loans and allowances for performing loans. Our approach to establishi ng\\nand maintaining the allowance on performing loans is based on the requirements of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), and considering the\\nguideline issued by OSFI. Under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) methodology, an allowance is recorded for expected credit losses on financialassets, regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. In particular, the ECL requirements of IFRS 9 incorporate the following elementsthat are subject to a high level of judgment: measuring 12-month and lifetime credit losses; determining when a significant increase in credit risk ha s\\noccurred; forecasting forward-looking information for multiple scenarios and determining the probability weighting of each scenario; and applic ation\\nof experienced credit judgment.\\nECL is calculated on a probability-weighted basis, based on four economic scenarios, and is calculated for each exposure in the portfolio as a\\nfunction of the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD), with the timing of the loss also considered. Wherethere has been a significant increase in credit risk, lifetime ECL is recorded; otherwise, 12 months of ECL is generally recorded. The determination o fa\\nsignificant increase in credit risk requires consideration of many different factors that will vary by product and risk segment. The main factorsconsidered in making this determination are the change in PD since origination and certain other criteria, such as 30-day past due and watchliststatus. We may apply experienced credit judgment to reflect factors not captured in the results produced by the ECL models, as we deem necessary.We apply experienced credit judgment to reflect the impact of the uncertain environment on credit conditions and the economy. We have controlsand processes in place to govern the ECL process, including judgments and assumptions used in determining the allowance on performing loans.These judgments and assumptions will change over time, and the impact of any such change will be recorded in future periods.\\nIn establishing our allowance on performing loans, we attach probability weightings to economic scenarios, which are representative of our view\\nof economic and market conditions. In fiscal 2024, we added a fourth scenario to reflect a less severe downside, allowing us to expand the range ofeconomic forecasts used in the allowance estimation. The base scenario represents our view of the most probable outcome, as well as upside,downside and severe downside scenarios, and are all developed by our Economics group.\\nThe allowance on performing loans is sensitive to changes in economic forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each forecast scenario.\\nWhen changes in economic performance in the forecasts are measured, we use real GDP as the basis, which acts as the key driver for movements inmany of the other economic and market variables used, including the equity volatility index (VIX), corporate BBB credit spreads, unemployment rates ,\\nhousing price indices and consumer credit. We also consider industry-specific variables, where applicable. Many of the variables have a high degree of\\ninterdependency, and as such, there is no single factor to which the allowances as a whole are sensitive. Holding all else constant, as economicvariables worsen, the allowance on performing loans would increase and conversely, as they improve, the allowance would decrease. In addition,assuming all variables are held constant, an increase in loan balances or a deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio would each drive a n\\nincrease in the allowance on performing loans.\\nInformation on the provision for credit losses for the years ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 can be found in the Total Provision for Credit Losses\\nsection. Additional information on the process and methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses can be found in the discussion ofCredit and Counterparty Risk, as well as in Note 4 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\\nWe record assets and liabilities classified as held for trading, assets and liabilities designated at fair value, derivatives, certain equity and de bt\\nsecurities and securities sold but not yet purchased at fair value. Fair value represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset orpaid on the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between willing parties at the measurement date. We employ a fair value hierarchy basedon inputs we use in valuation techniques to measure the fair value of our financial instruments.

For instruments that are valued using models, we consider all\\nreasonable available information and maximize the use of observable market data.\\nValuation Product Control (VPC), a group independent of the trading lines of business, seeks to ensure that the recorded fair values of financial\\ninstruments are materially accurate by:\\n‰Developing and maintaining valuation policies, procedures and methodologies in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS)\\nand regulatory requirements.\\n‰Establishing official rate sources for valuation data inputs.\\n‰Providing independent review of portfolios for which prices supplied by traders are used for valuation.\\nWhen VPC determines that adjustments to valuations are needed to better reflect fair value estimates based on data inputs from official rate\\nsources, the adjustments are subject to review and approval by the Valuation Steering Committee (VSC).\\nThe VSC is our senior management valuation committee. It meets at least monthly to address the more challenging valuation issues related to\\nour portfolios, approves valuation methodology changes as needed to enhance the reliability of our fair value estimates, and is a key forum for thediscussion of sources of valuation uncertainty and how these have been addressed by management. Certain financial instruments, including corporat e\\nequities, are valued by the respective business groups. Senior management oversees our valuation processes through various valuation and riskcommittees.\\nAs at October 31, 2024, total valuation adjustments were a net decrease in value of $268 million for financial instruments carried at fair value on\\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet (net decrease of $135 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nPension and Other Employee Future Benefits\\nOur pension and other employee future benefits expense is calculated by independent actuaries using assumptions determined by management.Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used are recognized in other comprehensive income.\\nPension and other employee future benefits expense, plan assets and defined benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in discount rates. We\\ndetermine discount rates at each year-end for all plans, using high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans’ specific cash flows.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for pension and other employee future benefits, including a sensitivity analysis for key assumptions ,\\nis included in Note 22 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nImpairment of Securities and Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\\nDebt securities measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are assessed for impairment using theexpected credit loss model. For securities determined to have low credit risk, the allowance for credit losses is measured with an amount equalto 12-month expected credit loss.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for debt securities measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, other securities, the related allowance for\\ncredit losses and the determination of fair value is included in Notes 3 and 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nWe review our investments in associates and joint ventures, included within other assets, at each quarter-end reporting period in order to\\nidentify and evaluate any investments that show indications of possible impairment. For these investments, a significant or prolonged decline in fa ir\\nvalue to an amount below cost is objective evidence of impairment.\\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\\nOur approach to tax matters is guided by our Statement on Tax Principles, elements of which are described below, and governed by our tax riskmanagement framework, which is implemented through internal controls and processes. We operate with due regard to risks, including tax andreputation risks. We actively seek to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report any tax risks that may arise in order to understand our financialexposure to those risks. Our intention is to comply fully with tax laws. We consider all applicable laws in connection with our commercial activities,and where tax laws change in our business or for our customers, we adapt and make adjustments accordingly. We monitor applicable tax-relateddevelopments, including legislative proposals, case law and guidance from tax authorities. When an interpretation or application of tax laws is notclear, we take well-reasoned positions based on available case law and administrative positions of tax authorities, and we engage external advisorswhen necessary. We do not engage in tax planning that does not have commercial substance, and we do not knowingly work with customers webelieve use tax strategies to evade taxes. We are committed to maintaining productive relationships and cooperating with tax authorities on all taxmatters. We seek to resolve disputes in a collaborative manner; however, when our interpretation of tax law differs from that of tax authorities, weare prepared to defend our position.\\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in either the Consolidated Statement\\nof Income, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. In determining the provisionfor income taxes, we interpret tax legislation, case law and administrative positions in numerous jurisdictions and, based on our judgment, we recor d\\nthe estimate of the amount required to settle tax obligations. We also make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred taxassets and liabilities. If the interpretations and assumptions differ from those of tax authorities or if the timing of reversals is not as expected, t he\\nprovision for income taxes could increase or decrease in future periods. The amount of any such increase or decrease cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which\\ndeductible temporary differences or unused tax losses and tax credits may be utilized. We are required to assess whether it is probable that deferredincome tax assets will be realized. Factors used to assess the probability of realization are past experience of income and capital gains, forecasts o f\\nfuture net income before taxes, and the remaining expiration period of tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. Changes in our assessment of thesefactors could increase or decrease the provision for income taxes in future periods.\\nCanadian tax authorities have reassessed us for additional income tax and interest in an amount of approximately $1,465 million in respect of\\ncertain 2011-2018 Canadian corporate dividends. These reassessments denied certain dividend deductions on the basis that the dividends were\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 111\\n\\n\\n## Page 100\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nreceived as part of a “dividend rental arrangement”. In general, the tax rules raised by Canadian tax authorities were prospectively addressed in\\nthe 2015 and 2018 Canadian federal budgets. We filed Notices of Appeal with the Tax Court of Canada and the matter is in litigation. We remain ofthe view that our tax filing positions were appropriate and intend to challenge all reassessments. However, if such challenges are unsuccessful, theadditional expense would negatively impact net income.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for income taxes is included in Note 23 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. This assessment includes a comparison of the carrying value and the recoverable amount ofeach of our cash-generating units (CGUs) in order to verify that the recoverable amount of each CGU is greater than its carrying value. If the carryingvalue of a CGU were to exceed its recoverable amount, an impairment calculation would be performed. The recoverable amount of a CGU is thehigher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\\nFair value less costs to sell has been used to perform the impairment test in all periods. In determining fair value less costs to sell, we employ a\\ndiscounted cash flow model, consistent with that used when a business is acquired. This model is dependent on assumptions related to revenuegrowth, discount rates, synergies achieved on acquisition and the availability of comparable acquisition data. Changes in any of these assumptionswould affect the determination of fair value for each of our CGUs in a different manner. Management must exercise judgment and make assumptionsin determining fair value. Differences in judgments and assumptions could affect the determination of fair value and any resulting impairmentwrite-down.\\nAs at October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, no goodwill impairment was recorded, as the estimated fair value of the CGUs was greater than\\ntheir carrying value.\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized to income on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over a period not exceeding\\n15 years, depending on the nature of the asset. We test intangible assets with definite lives for impairment when circumstances indicate thatthe carrying value may not be recoverable.\\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment. If an intangible asset is determined to be impaired, it will be written\\ndown to its recoverable amount, the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, when this is less than the carrying value.\\nAdditional information regarding the composition of goodwill and intangible assets is included in Note 11 of the audited annual consolidated\\nfinancial statements.\\nInsurance Contract Liabilities\\nInsurance contract liabilities represent estimates of fulfillment cash flows, which include a risk adjustment, and the contractual service margin (CSM).\\nFulfillment cash flows include estimates of future cash flows related to the remaining coverage period and for previously incurred claims, which arethen discounted and probability weighted. This is based on non-financial risk assumptions including mortality, policy lapses and expenses, which a re\\nbased on a combination of industry and entity specific data, and in the case of expenses, on historical analysis of which expenses are attributable toinsurance operations. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect actual experience and market conditions. In addition ,\\nwe add a risk adjustment for non-financial risk to bring the confidence level on the sufficiency of reserves to 70%-80%. The CSM is a component ofthe liability representing the unearned profit we recognize as we provide services.\\nAdditional information on insurance contract liabilities is provided in Note 15 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements, and\\ninformation on insurance risk is provided in the Insurance Risk section and the Insurance Market Risk section.\\nProvisions\\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, we have a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it isprobable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the amountrequired to settle any obligation as at the balance sheet date, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. For example, BMOand its subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions in the normal course of business. Factors considered in estimating any obligation related to\\nthese legal actions include a case-by-case assessment of specific facts and circumstances, past experience and the opinions of legal experts.Management and internal and external experts are involved in estimating any amounts that may be required. Certain provisions also relate torestructuring initiatives that we have undertaken. These provisions are recorded at management’s best estimate of the amounts that will ultimatelybe paid out.\\nThe actual costs of settling some obligations may be substantially higher or lower than the amount of the provisions.Additional information regarding provisions is included in the Legal and Regulatory Risk section and in Note 25 of the audited annual\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nTransfers of Financial Assets\\nWe sell Canadian residential and commercial mortgages to third-party Canadian securitization programs, including the Canada Mortgage BondProgram, and directly to third-party investors under the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities program.\\nWe also purchase or originate certain commercial mortgage loans that are subsequently sold and derecognized, and we purchase U.S.\\ngovernment agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) issued by third-party sponsored vehicles, which we may further securitize byrepackaging them into new CMOs prior to selling to third-party investors.\\nWe assess whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of, or control over, the assets have been transferred in order to determine if they\\nqualify for derecognition. Where we continue to be exposed to substantially all of the prepayment, interest rate and/or credit risk associated with t he\\nsecuritized assets, they do not qualify for derecognition. We continue to recognize these financial instruments, and recognize the related cashproceeds as a secured financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n112 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 101\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Consolidation of Structured Entities\\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into arrangements with SEs as described in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section. We are required\\nto consolidate a SE if we control the SE. We control a SE when we have power over the SE, exposure or rights to variable returns as a result of ourinvolvement, and the ability to exercise power to affect the amount of those returns. For certain SEs, we exercise judgment in determining whetherwe control the entity.\\nAdditional information concerning our interests in SEs is included in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section, as well as in Note 7 of the\\naudited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition of Bank of the West – Valuation of Assets and Liabilities\\nSignificant judgments and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the Bank of the West assets acquired and liabilities assumed,including the loan portfolio, core deposit and other relationship intangible assets and fixed-maturity deposits.\\nAdditional information regarding the accounting for this acquisition is included in Notes 4 and 10 of the audited annual consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\nCautionThis Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section contains forward-looking statements.

Upon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for the\\nmeasurement of investment properties, included in insurance-related assets in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, from cost to fairvalue. These changes were applied retrospectively to our fiscal 2023 results.\\nFurther details can be found in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nIFRS 9, Financial Instruments\\nEffective November 1, 2023, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy to account for regular way contracts to buy or sell financial assets on the\\ntrade date, instead of on the settlement date, and applied this change retrospectively.\\nIAS 12, Income Taxes\\nEffective November 1, 2023, we adopted an amendment to IAS 12, Income Taxes (IAS 12), which narrows the IAS 12 exemption to exclude\\ntransactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.\\nFurther details can be found in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nFuture Changes in Accounting Policies\\nIFRS 9, Financial Instruments\\nIn May 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), which introduce\\nadditional guidance in two areas. The first relates to financial assets with contingent features and when these features can be considered consisten t\\nwith a basic lending arrangement, in which case the instrument can be measured at amortized cost. The second relates to the timing of derecognitionof financial liabilities when payment takes place through an electronic payment system and certain conditions are met. These amendments will beeffective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of these amendments on our consolidated financialstatements.\\nIAS 12, Income Taxes\\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 12. The amendment addresses concerns around accounting for the global minimum top-up tax, as\\noutlined in the two-pillar plan for international tax reform developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/G20 Inclusiv e\\nFramework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. The amendment to IAS 12 includes temporary mandatory relief from recognizing and disclosingdeferred taxes related to the top-up tax. We have applied the temporary mandatory relief related to deferred taxes in jurisdictions in which weoperate where the top-up tax legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted. The global minimum tax rules will be effective for our fiscal yearbeginning November 1, 2024, and as a result, we expect an increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 of up to 65 basis points.\\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\\nIn April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18), which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\\nFinancial Statements , and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2027. IFRS 18 changes how information is grouped and\\npresented in the financial statements, and requires that certain management performance measures be included in the financial statements. We arecurrently assessing the impact of the standard on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\\nCautionThis Future Changes in Accounting Policies section contains forward-looking statements.

Beginning January 1, 2024, we no longer report this revenue related tocertain Canadian dividends on a taxable equivalent basis in BMO Capital Markets.\\nIn addition, the legislation included the Global Minimum Tax Act , which introduced a 15% global minimum tax on income earned by large\\nmultinational groups and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2024, as noted in the Future Changes in Accounting Policies –IAS 12, Income Taxes section.\\nU.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Assessment\\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) approved the final rule to implement the special assessment on depository\\ninstitutions to recover the losses incurred in the deposit insurance fund that were attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors of Silico n\\nValley Bank and Signature Bank. BMO recorded a $357 million ($476 million pre-tax) charge related to the FDIC special assessment in fiscal 2024. Weexpect further refinements of the amount of the special assessment in subsequent periods as the FDIC has greater visibility of the final loss amounts.\\nInterbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform\\nBMO has transitioned all exposure to Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) settings to alternative reference rates as at October 31, 2024.

The audit report states in its conclus ion\\nthat, in KPMG’s opinion, BMO maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at October 31, 2024, inaccordance with the criteria established in the 2013 COSO Framework.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended October 31, 2024 which materially affected, or arereasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n116 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 105\\n\\n         Supplemental Information         Supplemental Information\\nTen-Year Statistical Review\\nTABLE 64\\n($ millions)\\nAs at or for the year ended October 31 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015\\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet\\nAssetsCash and cash equivalents 65,098 77,934 87,466 93,261 57,408 48,803 42,142 32,599 31,653 40,295\\nInterest bearing deposits with banks 3,640 4,109 5,677 8,303 9,035 7,987 8,305 6,490 4,449 7,382\\nSecurities 396,880 320,084 272,551 232,849 234,260 189,438 180,935 163,198 149,985 130,918\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements 110,907 115,662 113,194 107,382 111,878 104,004 85,051 75,047 66,646 68,066\\nLoans, net of allowances 678,016 656,665 551,814 458,262 447,420 426,984 384,172 358,507 357,518 321,531\\nOther 155,106 172,552 142,695 88,118 89,260 74,979 72,688 73,763 77,709 73,689\\nTotal assets 1,409,647 1,347,006 1,173,397 988,175 949,261 852,195 773,293 709,604 687,960 641,881\\nLiabilities\\nDeposits 982,440 910,879 776,547 685,631 659,034 568,143 520,928 479,792 470,281 438,169\\nOther 334,544 351,776 317,662 238,128 225,218 225,981 199,862 180,438 170,910 159,383\\nSubordinated debt 8,377 8,228 8,150 6,893 8,416 6,995 6,782 5,029 4,439 4,416\\nTotal liabilities 1,325,361 1,270,883 1,102,359 930,652 892,668 801,119 727,572 665,259 645,630 601,968\\nTotal equity 84,286 76,123 71,038 57,523 56,593 51,076 45,721 44,345 42,330 39,913\\nTotal liabilities and equity 1,409,647 1,347,006 1,173,397 988,175 949,261 852,195 773,293 709,604 687,960 641,881\\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Income\\nNet interest income 19,468 18,681 15,885 14,310 13,971 12,888 11,438 11,275 10,945 9,796\\nNon-interest revenue 13,327 10,578 17,825 12,876 11,215 12,595 11,467 10,832 10,015 9,593\\nTotal revenue 32,795 29,259 33,710 27,186 25,186 25,483 22,905 22,107 20,960 19,389\\nInsurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit\\nliabilities (CCPB)\\n(1) – – (683) 1,399 1,708 2,709 1,352 1,538 1,543 1,254\\nProvision for credit losses (PCL) 3,761 2,178 313 20 2,953 872 662 746 771 544\\nNon-interest expense 19,499 21,134 16,194 15,509 14,177 14,630 13,477 13,192 12,916 12,250\\nIncome before income taxes 9,535 5,947 17,886 10,258 6,348 7,272 7,414 6,631 5,730 5,341\\nProvision for income taxes 2,208 1,510 4,349 2,504 1,251 1,514 1,961 1,292 1,100 936\\nNet income 7,327 4,437 13,537 7,754 5,097 5,758 5,453 5,339 4,630 4,405\\nNet income available to common shareholders 6,932 4,094 13,306 7,510 4,850 5,547 5,269 5,153 4,471 4,253\\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\\nPreferred shares and other equity instruments 8,087 6,958 6,308 5,558 6,598 5,348 4,340 4,240 3,840 3,240\\nCommon shares 23,921 22,941 17,744 13,599 13,430 12,971 12,929 13,032 12,539 12,313\\nContributed surplus 354 328 317 313 302 303 300 307 294 299\\nRetained earnings 46,469 44,006 45,117 35,497 30,745 28,725 25,850 23,700 21,207 18,930\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 5,419 1,862 1,552 2,556 5,518 3,729 2,302 3,066 4,426 4,640\\nNon-controlling interest in subsidiaries 36 2 8 –––––– 2 4 4 9 1\\nTotal equity 84,286 76,123 71,038 57,523 56,593 51,076 45,721 44,345 42,330 39,913\\nBMO adopted various new and amended IFRS standards in 2015, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) in 2018 and IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16) in 2020 prospectively, with no changes to prior periods.

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in \\nthis guideline.\\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the \\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \\n \\n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \\nrequirements described in OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .   \\n\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 2 Chapter 1  - Overview of risk -based capital \\nrequirements  \\n \\nThe Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) for banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies are set out in nine chapters, each of which has been issued as a separate document.

Outlined below is an overview of the capital adequacy requirements for banks \\n(including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies , collectively referred to as ‘institutions’.  \\n 2. This chapter is drawn from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Basel \\nFramework published on the Bank for I nternational S ettlements (BIS)  website .\\n2 For reference, \\nthe Basel paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are indicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph .\\n3  \\n \\n1. 1. Scope of Application  \\n 3. The capital adequacy requirements outlined in this guideline apply on a consolidated \\nbasis to the following institutions:  \\na. all institutions designated  by OSFI as domestic systemically important banks (D -\\nSIBs); and  \\nb. small and medium- sized deposit -taking institutions (SMSBs\\n4), which fall into \\nCategories I, II or III as defined in OSFI’s SMSB Capital and Liquidity Requirements Guideline.\\n5  \\n 4. The consolidated entity includes all subsidiaries except insurance subsidiaries.\\n OSFI \\nexpects institutions to hold capital within the consolidated group in a manner that is consistent with the level and location of risk.    \\n1. 2. Regulatory Capital  \\n 5. Total capital consists of the sum of the following elements: \\ni. Tier 1 capital, consisting  of: \\na. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ; and  \\nb. Additional Tier 1 capital  \\nii. Tier 2 capital  \\n \\n \\n2    The Basel Framework   \\n3  Following the form at: [Basel Framework, XXX yy.zz]  \\n4    SMSBs are banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, \\nand federally regulated loan companies that have not been designated by OSFI as domestic systemically \\nimpo rtant banks (D -SIBs). This includes subsidiaries of SMSBs or D -SIBs that are banks (including federal \\ncredit unions) , federally regulated trust companies or federally regulated loan companies.  \\n5    SMSB Capital and Liquidity Guideline  \\n\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 5 6. The criteria for the capital elements comprising the two tiers, as well as the various \\nlimits, restrictions and regulatory adjustments to which they are subject, are de scribed in \\nChapter  2. \\n \\n1. 3. Total Risk -weighted Assets \\n \\n7. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) make up the denominator of the risk- based capital ratios, \\nand is calculated as the higher of:  \\na. the sum of the following three elements:  \\ni. RWA for credit risk;  \\nii. RWA for market risk; and  \\niii. RWA for operational risk; and \\nb. the adjusted RWA determined as per the capital floor described in section 1.5. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.4]  \\n 1.3.1. Credit Risk   8. RWA for credit risk (including counterparty credit risk) is calculated as the sum of:  \\na. Credit  RWA for banking book exposures which, except the RWA listed in (b) \\nthrough (e) below, is calculated using:   \\ni. the standar dized approach (as set out in Chapter 4); or  \\nii. the Internal Ratings -Based (IRB) approach (as set out in Chapter 5).  \\nb. RWA for counterparty credit risk from banking book exposures and trading book exposures (as set out in Chapter 7), except the exposures liste d in (c) and (f) below.  \\nc. Credit RWA for equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book calculated using one or more of the approaches set out in Chapter 4:  \\ni. The look- through approach \\nii. The mandate -based approach  \\niii. The fall -back approach  \\nd. RWA for se curitization exposures held in the banking book, calculating using one \\nor more of the approaches set out in Chapter 6:  \\ni. Securitization Standardized Approach (SEC -SA) \\nii. Securitization External  Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -ERBA)  \\niii. Securitization Internal Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -IRBA)  \\niv. Securitization Internal Assessment Approach (SEC -IAA)  \\nv.

RWA for exposures to central counterparties in the banking book and trading \\nbook, calculated using the approach set out in Chapter 7.  \\nf. RWA for the risk posed by unsettled transactions and failed trades, where the transactions are in the banking book or tra ding book and are within the scope of \\nthe rules set out in Chapter 7.  \\ng. RWA for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk for exposures in the trading and banking book, calculated as set out in Chapter 8 using either:  \\ni. The standardized approach for CVA; or  \\nii. The advanced approach for CVA.    \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.6]  \\n 9. Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \\n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \\n 11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be \\nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:  \\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;   \\n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and  \\n• own-use property, plant and equipment  \\n 12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \\nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:  \\n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and  \\n• accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \\nresult of subsequent revaluations  \\n 13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \\n \\n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \\nbooked in Canada.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 7  \\na.

Market risk requirements, as outlined in Chapter 9, apply to internationally active \\ninstitutions and all institutions designated by OSFI as D -SIBs. OSFI retains the right to apply the \\nframework to other institutions, on a case -by-case basis, if trading activities are a large \\nproportion of overall operations. \\n \\n16. Institutions subject to market risk requirements must identify the instruments that are in \\nthe trading book following the requirements of Chapter 9. All instruments that are not in the trading book and all other a ssets of the institution (termed “banking book exposures”) must be \\ntreated under one of the credit risk approaches.

Approval to use Internal Model Based Approaches  \\n \\n21. Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \\n 22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \\nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \\nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\\n8 Institutions that do not receive \\napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23. An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \\n \\n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \\nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \\n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \\nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \\n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \\nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \\n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \\n \\n \\n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implemen tation Note  \\n\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \\nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \\nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \\nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \\nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \\n \\n \\n1. 5. Capital Floor –Internal Model Based Approaches  \\n \\n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \\ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \\ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \\nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \\nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \\n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \\ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \\ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \\nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \\n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \\n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \\ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \\n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \\n \\n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \\noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \\ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \\nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \\nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline. \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 10\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \\nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \\nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \\nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \\nFiscal year  \\n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \\nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \\n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \\n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \\ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \\n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \\n \\n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \\ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter 4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this guideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \\n \\n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \\nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \\nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. After November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \\napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.   34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \\nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline.  35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \\ncalculation of the capital floor:  \\na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \\nb. SEC-IRBA;  \\nc. the IMA for market risk;  \\nd. the VaR  models approach to counterparty credit risk; and  \\n \\n10  For institutions with a fiscal year ending October 31 or December 31, respectively.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 11 e. the IMM for counterparty credit risk.11  \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.12] \\n1.5.2. Adjusted Capital Requirement  \\n \\n36. The adjusted capital requirement is based on application of all of the chapters of this \\nguideline and is equal to the net total of the following amounts: \\ni. total risk -weighted assets, plus \\nii. 12.5 times the provisioning shortfall deduction, less \\niii. 12.5 times excess provisions included in Tier 2, less \\niv. 12.5 times the amount of general allowances that may be recognized in Tier 2 in respect of exposures for which the standardized approach is used. \\n 37. The provisioning shortfall deduction, excess provisions included in Tier 2, and general \\nallowances in Tier 2 in respect of standardized portfolios are defined in section 2.1.3.7 of Chapter 2 of this guideline.  \\n1. 6. Calculation of OSFI Minimum Capital Requirements  \\n 1.6.1. Risk -Based Capital Ratios for D-SIBs and Category I and II SMSBs  \\n 38. Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for \\nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for \\nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets \\nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:  \\nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 \\n Where:  \\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \\nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \\n 39. Table 2 provides the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios for institutions \\nbefore application of the capital conservation buffer.   \\n \\n11  There are two exceptions to this rule. One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \\ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \\nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the \\nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so. Both of these \\nexceptions expire when the revised CVA framework is implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2024.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 12\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 12 Table 2: Minimum capital requirements (in RWA)  \\nCET1  4.5%  \\nTier 1  6.0%  \\nTotal  8.0%  \\n \\n1.6.2. Simplified Risk -Based Capital Ratio for Category III SMSBs \\n 40.   Category III SMSBs are subject to a Simplified Risk -Based Capital Ratio (SRBCR), \\ncalculated as follows:  \\n \\nSRBCR  =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\\n𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴\\n𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑇𝑇\\n𝑇𝑇\\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴\\n + 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶  𝑹𝑹𝑶𝑶𝑹𝑹 𝑹𝑹 \\n Where:  \\n \\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \\n \\nAdjusted Total Assets =  Total Assets from the Balance Sheet, less the aggregate of all adjustments to regulatory capital as  \\nset out in Chapter 2.  \\n \\nRWA \\nOperational Risk =  Risk-Weighted Assets for operational risk, calculated as \\ndetailed in Chapter 3 . \\n  41.

Mandated Capital Buffers  \\n 42. In addition to the minimum capital ratios, institutions are required to hold a capital \\nconservation buffer and, where applicable, a countercyclical buffer.    43. Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \\nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.20]  \\n\\n\\n## Page 13\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 13 44. When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\\n12 Institutions may also \\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In \\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions \\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \\n \\n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \\nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of RWA .\\n13 Table 4 provides the minimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conversation buffer. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.2]   \\n \\nTable 4: Capital conservation buffer (as % of RWA)  \\nCapital conservation buffer  2.5%  \\nMinimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer  \\nCET1  7.0%  \\nTier 1  8.5%  \\nTotal  10.5%  \\n 48. Capital distribution constraints will be imposed on an institution when capital levels fall \\nwithin the buffer conservation range. Institutions will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall within the buffer range as they experience losses. The constraints imposed \\n \\n12    Applies only to performance bonuses issued to institutions’ senior management. The term “senior management”  \\nis defined in OSFI’s Corporate Governance Guideline .  \\n13   For Category  III SMSBs, the capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of [Adjusted Total Assets +  \\nRWA Operational Risk ] \\n\\n\\n## Page 14\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 14 relate only to distributions, not the operations of the institution. The distribution constraints \\nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs’ Total Loss \\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \\nof earnings)  \\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \\n>7.0%  0% \\n 50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \\n \\n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio . \\n\\n\\n## Page 15\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \\npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \\nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \\n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \\n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \\n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \\nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \\nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \\nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer  \\n 53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \\naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed \\nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide \\nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential \\nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \\n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \\ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and \\nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\\n18 will be put in place  when \\n \\n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (“FISC”), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.  \\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides informat ion that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national \\nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 30.10]  \\n17  The Bank of Canada will be the primary source of public information on macro- financial developments and the \\nstate of vulnerabilities in Canada with regard to the countercyclical buffer, including as published in its Financial \\nSystem Review (FSR).  \\n18   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer requirement would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total \\nAssets + RWA Operational Risk ] \\n\\n\\n## Page 16\", 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'chunk_index': 0, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:07.307404', 'file_size': 554263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt1_0.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf'}, {'page_content': \"## Page 16\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 16 circumstances warrant.

OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of \\nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1% \\nof RWAs. The 1% capital surcharge will be periodically reviewed in light of national and international developments . This is consistent with the levels and timing set out in the BCBS D -\\nSIB framework. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.7 to 40.23]  \\n 66. The 1% surcharge will be implemented through an extension of the capital conservation \\nbuffer. This is in line with the tre atment of the higher loss absorbency requirement for global \\nsystemically important banks (G -SIBs) prescribed by the BCBS .\\n30 Table 7 below sets out the \\nminimum capital conservation ratios a D -SIB must meet at various CET1 capital ratios  and Tier \\n1 leverage ratio s.31 D-SIBs will thus be subject to a pre -determined set of restrictions on the \\n \\n25  The Superintendent will consider factors such as whether an institution’s business model involves providing \\ncredit through intermediation of funds or whether  the conditions that give rise to financial system -wide issues are \\nexplicitly addressed in a robust manner in the institution’s internal capital targets.  \\n26   The countercyclical buffer is to be computed and applied at the consolidated FRFI parent level, i. e. OSFI \\nregulated deposit -taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit -taking institution are not \\nsubject to the countercyclical buffer.  \\n27   The pre -announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.  \\n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA \\nOperational Risk ]. \\n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI’s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs.  \\n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6  \\n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D -SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements.  \\nIn the event that a D -SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CE T1, 9.5% Tier \\n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 19\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 19 ability to make distributions, such as dividends and share buy-backs, if they do not meet these \\nrequirements (see relevant provisions of section 1.7.1).  \\n \\n \\nTable 7: Minimum capital conservation ratios for D -SIBs at various ranges of \\nCET1  or Tier 1 Leverage Ratios  \\nCET1 Ratio  Tier 1 Leverage \\nRatio  Minimum Capital Conservation \\nRatio  \\n4.5% - 5.375%  3%–3.125%  100%  \\n>5.375% - 6.250%  > 3.125% –3.25%  80% \\n>6.250% - 7.125%  > 3.25% –3.375%  60% \\n>7.125% - 8.0%  > 3.375% –3.50%  40% \\n>8.0%  > 3.50%  0% \\n  \\n1. 9. Domestic Stability Buffer  \\n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \\nCommittee (FISC) .\\n33 \\n \\n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB’s total RWA calculated \\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \\nCET1 c apital.  \\n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI’s Gu ide to Intervention\\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \\n \\n \\n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n\\n\\n## Page 20\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \\nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \\nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \\n \\n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could \\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \\n \\n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to \\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In \\nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \\nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \\n \\n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \\n \\n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \\n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \\nplus the conservation buffer .\\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\\nons, where applicable.  \\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \\nsurcharge of 1.0%.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 21\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 21 Table 8: Target Capital Ratios  \\n \\n SMSBs  D-SIBs  \\nTarget CET1 capital  7.0%  8.0% plus DSB  \\nTarget Tier 1 capital  8.5%  9.5% plus DSB  \\nTarget Total capital  10.5%  11.5%  plus DSB  \\n \\n75. These targets are applicable to all institutions and are triggers for supervisory intervention \\nconsistent with OSFI’s Guide to Intervention.37 If an institution is offside the relevant target ratios, \\nsupervisory action will be taken proportional to the shortfall and circumstances that caused the shortfall and may include a range of actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on distribu tions.  \\n 76. The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions or \\ngroups of institutions where circumstances warrant, including in respect of idiosyncratic and/or systemic risks that are not adequately captured by institutions ’ Pillar I capital requirements and \\nbuffers. The need for Pillar II capital and corresponding higher target capital ratios would consider how robust existing capital ratios are in light of an institution’s allowances, stress testing program, and ICAAP results .\\n38  \\n \\n \\n37  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n38  For OSFI’s expectations refer to Guideline E -18: Stress Testing  and Guideline E -19: Internal Capital Adequac y \\nAssessment Process (ICAAP) . \\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 22 Annex 1   Domestic Systemic Importance and Capital Targets  \\n \\n1. The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \\n \\nSize  \\n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \\n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \\n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \\n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \\n \\nInter -connections \\n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \\ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \\n \\nSubstitutability  \\n \\n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \\n \\n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 23\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \\nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \\nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \\nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \\n \\n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \\nrange of evidence are the following:  \\n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \\n \\n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\\n  \\n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \\n \\nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \\n \\n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \\n \\n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks  \\n\\n\\n## Page 24\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 24 institution. The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \\ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \\npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \\n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \\n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \\n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \\n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \\n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \\n Supervisory Implications  \\n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\\n44 The Framework is applied on a \\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \\n \\n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \\n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \\nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \\n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 25\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \\nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \\n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \\n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \\nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \\n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \\n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \\n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \\n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \\norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \\ndisclosure practices;  \\n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \\nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \\n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \\n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \\n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \\nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\\n45  \\n Information Disclosure Practices  \\n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \\ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions’ risk models and risk management \\npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \\nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \\nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \\n \\n \\n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \\nImportant Financial Institutions .

Treatment of counterparty credit risk and cross -product netting  \\n 2. This rule identifies permissible methods for estimating the Exposure at Default (EAD) \\nor the exposure amount for instruments with counterparty credit risk under this guideline.\\n3  \\nInstitutions may seek OSFI approval to make use of an Internal Modelling Method (IMM) meeting the requirements and specifications identified herein. As an alternative institutions may also use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA- CCR).  [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 53.1] \\n7.1.1 Definitions and general terminology  \\n3. This section defines terms that will be used throughout this chapter. \\n \\n7.1.1.1 General terms  \\n \\n• Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR)  is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could \\ndefault before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss would occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default. Unlike an institution’s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending institution faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of the transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The market value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying market factors.  \\n• A central counterparty  (CCP) is a clearing house that interposes itself between \\ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance of open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants through novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the purposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.   \\n• A qualifying central counterparty  (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as  a \\nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted by the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products \\n \\n1    The Basel Framework   \\n2  Following the format: [Basel Framework XXX yy.zz].  \\n3 In this document, the terms “exposure at default” and “exposure amount” are used together in order to identify \\nmeasures of exposure under both an internal ratings -based (IRB) and a standardi zed approach for credit risk.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 5 offered. This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised \\nin a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the CPSS -IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.  \\nWhere the CCP is in a jurisdiction that does not have a CCP regulator applying the \\nPrinciples to the CCP, then OSFI may make the determination of whether the CCP meets \\nthis definition.  \\nIn addition, for a CCP to be considered as a QCCP, the requirements in paragraph 204 \\nmust be met to permit each clearing member institution to calculate its capital requirement for its default fund contributions.  \\n• A clearing member is a member of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is entitled to enter into a transaction with the CCP, regardless of whether it enters into trades with a CCP for its own hedging, investment or speculative purposes or wh ether it also enters \\ninto trades as a financial intermediary between the CCP and other market participants .\\n4  \\n• A client is a party to a transaction with a CCP through either a clearing member acting as \\na financial intermediary, or a clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the client \\nto the CCP.  \\n• Initial margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted to the CCP to mitigate the potential future exposure of the CCP to the clearing member arising from the possible future change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of the calculation of counterparty credit risk capital requirements, initial margin does not include contributions to a CCP for mutualized loss sharing arrangements (i.e., in case a CCP uses initial margin to mutualize losses among the clearing members, it will be treated as a default fund exposure). Initial margin may include excess collateral, in cases \\nwhere the CCP may prevent the clearing member and the clearing member may prevent the client from withdrawing the excess.   \\n• Variation margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted on a daily or intraday basis to a CCP based upon price movements of their transactions.  \\n• Trade exposures (in section 7.1.8) include the current\\n5 and potential future exposure of a \\nclearing member or a client to a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange traded derivatives transactions or securities financing transactions (SFTs), as well as initial margin.  \\n• Default funds , also known as clearing deposits or guaranty fund contributions (or any \\nother names), are clearing members’ funded or unfunded contributions towards, or underwriting of, a CCP’s mutualized loss sharing arrangements. The description given by \\n \\n4  For the purposes of this chapter, where a CCP has a link to a second CCP, that second CCP is to be treated as a \\nclearing member of the first CCP. Whether the second CCP’s collateral contribution t o the first CCP is treated as \\ninitial margin or a default fund contribution will depend upon the legal arrangement between the CCPs. OSFI \\nshould be consulted to determine the treatment of this initial margin and default fund contributions.    \\n5  For the pu rposes of this definition, the current exposure of a clearing member includes the variation margin due \\nto the clearing member but not yet received.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 6 a CCP to its mutualized loss sharing arrangements is not determinative of its status as a \\ndefault fund; rather, the substance of such arrangements will govern its status.  \\n• Offsetting transaction means the transaction leg between the clearing member and the CCP when the clearing member acts on behalf of a client (e.g. , when a clearing member \\nclears or novates a client’s trade). \\n \\n• A multi -level client structure is one in which institutions can centrally clear as indirect \\nclients; that is, when clearing services are provided to the institution by an institution which is not a direct clearing member, but is itself a client of a clearing member or another clearing client. For exposures between clients and clients of clients, we use the term “ higher -level client ” for the institution providing clearing services; and the term \\n“lower level client ” for the institution clearing through that client.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.6]  \\n \\n7.1.1.2 Transaction types  \\n \\n• Long Settlement Transactions are transactions where a counterparty undertakes to deliver a security, a commodity, or a foreign exchange amount against cash, other financial instruments, or commodities, or vice versa, at a settlement or delivery date that is contractually specified as more than the lower of the market standard for this particular instrument and five business days after the date on which the institution enters into the transaction.  \\n• Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) are transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and borrowing, and margin lending transactions, where the value of the transactions depends on market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements.  \\n• Margin Lending Transactions are transactions in which an institution extends credit in connection with the purchase, sale, carrying or trading of securities. Margin lending transactions do not include other loans that happen to be secured by securities collateral. Generally, in margin lending transactions, the loan amount is collaterali zed by securities \\nwhose value is greater than the amo unt of the loan. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.14]  \\n \\n7.1.1.3 Netting sets, hedging sets, and related terms  \\n \\n• Netting Set  is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \\nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is  recogni zed for \\nregulatory capital purposes under Chapter 4 or the Cross -Product Netting Rules set forth \\nin this chapter. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is recogni zed for regulatory capital purposes should be \\ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules.  \\n• Hedging Set  is a set of transactions within a single netting set within which full or partial \\noffsetting is recognized for purposes of calculating the potential future exposure (PFE) add-on of the SA -CCR. .  \\n\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 7 • Margin Agreement is  a contractual agreement or provisions to an agreement under \\nwhich one counterparty must supply collateral to a second counterparty when an \\nexposure of that second counterparty to the first counterpa rty exceeds a specified level.  \\n• Margin Threshold  is the largest amount of an exposure that remains outstanding until \\none party has the right to call for collateral.  \\n• Margin Period of Risk is the time period from the last exchange of collateral covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterpart until that counterpart is closed out and the resulting market risk is re -hedged.  \\n• Effective Maturity under the Internal Model Metho d for a netting set with maturity \\ngreater than one year is the ratio of the sum of expected exposure over the life of the transactions in a netting set discounted at the risk- free rate of return divided by the sum of \\nexpected exposure over one year in a ne tting set discounted at the risk -free rate. This \\neffective maturity may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing expected exposure with effective expected exposure for forecasting horizons under one year. The formula is given in paragraph 35.  \\n• Cross -Product Netting refers to the inclusion of transactions of different product \\ncategories within the same netting set pursuant to the Cross -Product  Netting Rules set out \\nin this chapter.  \\n• Current Market Value (CMV) refers to the net market value of the portfolio of \\ntransactions within the netting set with the counterparty. Both positive and negative market values are used in computing CMV. \\n[ Basel Fr amework, CRE 50.15]  \\n \\n7.1.1.4 Distributions  \\n \\n• Distribution of Market Values  is the forecast of the probability distribution of net \\nmarket values of transactions within a netting set for some future date (the forecasting horizon) given the reali zed market value of those transactions up to the present time.  \\n• Distribution of Exposures is the forecast of the probability distribution of market values that is generated by setting forecast instances of negative net market values equal to zero (this takes account of the fact that, when the institution owes the counterparty money, the institu tion does not have an exposure to the counterparty).  \\n• Risk -Neutral Distribution is  a distribution of market values or exposures at a future \\ntime period where the distribution is calculated using market implied values such as implied volatilities.  \\n• Actual D istribution is a distribution of market values or exposures at a future time \\nperiod where the distribution is calculated using historic or reali zed values such as \\nvolatilities calculated using past price or rate changes.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.22 to 50.25]  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 8\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 8 7.1.1.5 Exposure measures and adjustments  \\n \\n• Current Exposure is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction or portfolio \\nof transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default \\nof the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in \\nbankruptcy. Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.  \\n• Peak Exposure  is a high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution of \\nexposures at any particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction in the netting set. A peak exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.  \\n• Expected Exposure is the mean (average) of the distribution of exposures at any particular future date before the longest -maturity transaction in the netting set matures. \\nAn expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the \\nlongest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.  \\n• Effecti ve Expected Exposure at a specific date is the maximum expected exposure that \\noccurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as \\nthe greater of the expected exposur e at that date, or the effective exposure at the previous \\ndate. In effect, the Effective Expected Exposure is the Expected Exposure that is constrained to be non- decreasing over time.  \\n• Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of exp ected \\nexposures where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval. When calculating the minimum capital requirement, \\nthe average is taken over the first year or, if all the contracts in the net ting set mature \\nbefore one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract in the netting set.  \\n• Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE) is the weighted average over time of effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if al l the contracts in the \\nnetting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract \\nin the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval.  \\n• Credit Va luation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid -market valuation of the \\nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the credit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. This a djustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the \\nmarket value of the credit risk of both the institution and the counterparty.  \\n• One-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects \\nthe mar ket value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does not reflect the \\nmarket value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty.  \\n• Debit Valuation Adjustment  is a valuation adjustment that reflects the market value of \\nthe credit  risk of the institution to the counterparty (i.e. changes in the reporting \\ninstitution’s own credit risk), but does not reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution. [Added by OSFI]  \\n[ Basel Framework, CRE 50.26 to 50.33]  \\n\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 9  \\n7.1.1.6 CCR -related risks  \\n \\n• Rollover Risk  is the amount by which expected positive exposure is understated when \\nfuture transactions with a counterpart are expected to be conducted on an ongoing basis, \\nbut the additional exposure generated by those future transactions is not included in calculatio n of expected positive exposure.  \\n• General Wrong -Way Risk arises when the probability of defaul t of counterparties is \\npositively correlated with general market risk factors.  \\n• Specific Wrong -Way Risk arises when the exposure to a particular counterpart is \\npositively correlated with the probability of default of the counterparty due to the nature of the transactions with the counterparty.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.34 to 50.36]  \\n7.1.2 Scope of application  \\n4. Banks  must calculate a counterparty credit risk charge for all exposures that give rise to \\ncounterparty credit risk, with the exception of those transactions listed in paragraphs  10 and 11 \\nbelow. The categories of transaction that give rise to counterparty credit ris k are:  \\n• OTC Derivatives;  \\n• Exchange -traded derivatives (ETDs)  \\n• Long Settlement transactions; and \\n• Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs)  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.4]  \\n 5. Such instruments generally exhibit the following abstract characteristics:  \\n• the transactions generate a current exposure or market value;  \\n• the transactions have an associated random future market value based on market variables;  \\n• the transactions generate an exchange of future payments or an exchange of a financial instrument (including commodities) against payment;  \\n• the transactions are undertaken with an identified counterparty against which a unique probability of default can be determined.\\n6 \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.5]  \\n \\n \\n6  Transactions for which the probability of default is defined on a pooled basis are not included in this t reatment of \\nCCR.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 10\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 10 6. Other common characteristics of the transactions to be covered may include the \\nfollowing:  \\n• collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in the nature of some \\ntransactions;  \\n• short -term financing may be a primary objective in that the t ransactions mostly consist of \\nan exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a relatively short period of time, usually for the business purpose of financing. The two sides of the transactions are not the result of separate decisions but form an indivisible whole to accomplish a defined objective;  \\n• netting may be used to mitigate the risk; \\n• positions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis), according to market \\nvariables . \\n• remargining may be employed. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.6]  \\n \\n7.1.3 Methods for Computing CCR Exposure  \\n7. For the transaction types listed in paragraph 4 above, banks must calculate their \\ncounterparty credit risk exposure, or exposure at default (EAD) ,\\n7 using one of the methods set \\nout in paragraphs 8 to 9 below. The methods vary according to the type of the transaction, the \\ncounterpar ty to the transaction, and whether the bank has received supervisory approval to use \\nthe method (if such approval is required). [Basel Framework, CRE 51.7]  \\n8. For exposures that are not cleared through a central counterparty (CCP) the following \\nmethods must be used to calculate the counterparty credit risk exposure:  \\n(1) The standardi zed approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (SA -CCR), \\nwhich is set out in section 7.1.7. This method is to be used for exposures arising from OTC \\nderivatives, exchange -traded derivatives and long settlement transactions. This method must be \\nused if the bank does not have approval to use the internal model method (IMM).  \\n(2) The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of collateral, which are \\nboth set out in the credit risk mitigation section  of the standardi zed approach to credit risk (see \\nChapter 4, section 4.3). These methods are t o be used for securities financing transactions (SFTs) \\nand must be used if the bank does not have approval to use the value -at-risk (VaR) models or the \\nIMM.  \\n \\n7    The terms “exposure” and “EAD” are used interchangabl y in the counterparty credit risk chapters of the credit \\nrisk standard. This reflects the fact that the amounts calculated under the counterparty credit risk rules must \\ntypically be used as either the “exposure” within the standardi zed approach to credit ri sk, or the EAD within the \\ninternal ratings -based (IRB) approach to credit risk, as described in paragraph 13 . \\n\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 11 (3) The VaR models approach, which is set out in Chapter 4, section 4.3. The VaR models \\napproach m ay be used to calculate EAD for SFTs, subject to supervisory approval, as an \\nalternative to the method set out in (2) above.  \\n(4) The IMM, which is set out in 7.1.5. This method may be used, subject to supervisory approval, as an alternative to the methods to calculate counterparty credit risk exposures set out in (1) and (2) above (for all of the exposures referenced in those bullets).  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.8]  \\n9. For exposures that are cleared through a CCP, banks must apply the method set out in \\nsection 7.1.8. This method covers:  \\n(1) the exposures of a bank to a CCP when the bank is a clearing member of the CCP;  \\n(2) the exposures of a bank to its clients, when the bank is a clearing member and acts as an intermediary between the client and the CCP; and  \\n(3) the exposures of a bank to a clearing member of a CCP, when the bank is a client of the \\nclearing member and the clearing member is acting as an intermediary between the bank and the CCP. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.8]  \\n10. Exposures arising from the settlement of cash transactions (equi ties, fixed income, spot \\nFX and spot commodities) are not subject to this treatment .\\n8 The settlement of cash transactions \\nremains subject to the treatment described in section 7.2. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.10]  \\n 11. As an exception to the requirements of paragraph 4 above, banks are not required to \\ncalculate a counterparty credit risk charge for the following types of transactions (i.e. the \\nexposure amount or EAD for counterparty credit risk for the trans action will be zero):  \\n(1) Credit derivative protection purchased by the bank against a banking book exposure, or \\nagainst a counterparty credit risk exposure. In such cases, the bank will determine its capital \\nrequirement for the hedged exposure according t o the criteria and general rules for the \\nrecognition of credit derivatives within the standardi zed approach or IRB approach to credit risk \\n(i.e. substitution approach). \\n(2) Sold credit default swaps in the banking book where they are treated in the framework as a \\nguarantee provided by the bank and subject to a credit risk charge for the full notional amount.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.16]  \\n \\n12. Under the methods outlined above, the exposure amount or EAD for a given \\ncounterparty is equal to the sum of the exposure  amounts or EADs calculated for each netting set \\n \\n8  For contributions to prepaid default funds covering settlement- risk-only products, the applicable risk weight is \\n0%.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 12\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 12 with that counterparty,9 subject to the exception outlined in paragraph 13. [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 51.11]  \\n \\n13. The exposure or EAD for a given OTC derivative counterparty is defined as the greater \\nof zero, and the difference between the following: the sum of EADs across all netting sets with \\nthe counterparty, and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for that counterparty which has \\nalready been recogni zed by the bank as an incurred write -down (i.e., a CVA loss). This CVA \\nloss is calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit valuation adjustments or \\nfunding valuation adjustments deducted from capital under Chapter 2 of this guideline. This reduction of EAD by incurred CVA losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA risk capital requirement.  [Basel Fr amework, CRE 51.13]  \\n 14. RWAs for a given OTC derivative counterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk \\nweight under the s tandardi zed or IRB approach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the \\ncounterparty. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.12]  \\n7.1.4 Approval to adopt an internal modelling method to estimate EAD  \\n15. An institution (meaning the individual legal entity or a group) that wishes to adopt an \\ninternal modelling method to measure exposure or EAD for regulatory capital purposes must seek OSFI approval. IMM is  available both for institutions that adopt the internal ratings -based \\napproach to credit risk and for institutions for which the standardi zed approach to credit risk \\napplies to all of their credit risk exposures. Only institutions subject to the market risk rules of Chapter 9 of this guideline are permitted to apply for the use of the IMM. The institution must meet all of the requirements given in s ection  7.1.5. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.1]  \\n 16. An institution may also choose to adopt an internal modelling method to measure CCR  \\nfor regulatory capital purposes for its exposures or EAD to only OTC derivatives, to only SFTs, \\nor to both, subject to the appropriate recognition of netting specified below in section 7.1.6. The institution must apply the method to all relevant exposures within that category, except for those that are immaterial in size and risk. During the initial implementation of the internal models method, an inst itution may use the SACCR for a portion of its business. The institution must \\nsubmit a plan to OSFI to bring all material exposures for that category of transactions under the IMM. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.2]  \\n 17. For all OTC derivative transactions and for al l long settlement transactions for which an \\ninstitution has not received OSFI approval to use the internal models method, the institution must use the SA -CCR. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.3]  \\n 18. Exposures or EAD arising from long settlement transactions can be de termined using \\neither of the methods identified in this guideline regardless of the methods chosen for treating OTC derivatives and SFTs. In computing capital requirements for long settlement transactions, institutions that hold permission to use the inter nal ratings -based approach may opt to apply the \\n \\n9  Where a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets and the SA -CCR is used, refer to paragraphs \\n166 to 167.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 13\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 13 risk weights under the standardi zed approach for credit risk on a permanent basis and \\nirrespective to the materiality of such positions. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.4]  \\n \\n19. After adoption of the internal model method, the institution must comply with the above \\nrequirements on a permanent basis. Only under exceptional circumstances or for immaterial \\nexposures can an institution revert to the SA -CCR for all or part of its exposure. In all cases, the \\ninstitution must ob tain approval from OSFI to do so and demonstrate that reversion to a less \\nsophisticated method does not lead to an arbitrage of the regulatory capital rules. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.5]  \\n7.1.5 Internal Model Method: measuring exposure and minimum  requirements  \\n7.1.5.1 Exposure amount or EAD under the internal model method  \\n20. CCR exposure or EAD is measured at the level of the netting set as defined in sections \\n7.1.1 and 7.1.6. A qualifying internal model for measuring counterparty credit exposure must \\nspecify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to changes in market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, etc. The model then computes the firm’s CCR exposure for the netting set at each future date given the changes in the market variables. For margined counterparties, the model may also captur e future collateral \\nmovements. Institutions may include eligible financial collateral as defined in section 4.3.3 and Chapter 9  in their forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set, if \\nthe quantitative, qualitative and data  requirements for internal model method are met for the \\ncollateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.6]  \\n 21. To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk for exposures \\nsubject to the IMM, institutions must use the greater of the portfolio- level capital charge (not \\nincluding the CVA charge in Chapter 8) based on Effective EPE using current market data and the portfolio- level capital charge based on Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress \\ncalibration should be a single consistent  stress calibration for the whole portfolio of \\ncounterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration should be applied on a total portfolio level and not on a counterparty by counterparty basis. [Basel Framework,  CRE 53.7]  \\n 22. OSFI expects institutions to have in place a policy for verifying the adequacy of, and \\nupdating, their choice of stress period. This policy would have to be approved in advance by OSFI as part of the IMM model approval process. Changes to this policy would constitute a major modification of the IMM model . \\n 23. To the extent that an institution recogni zes collateral in exposure amount or EAD via \\ncurrent exposure, an institution would not be permitted to recogni ze the benefits in its estimates \\nof LGD.  As a result, the institution would be required to use an LGD of an otherwise similar \\nuncollaterali zed facility. In other words, it would be required to use an LGD that does not \\ninclude collateral that is already included in EAD. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.8]  \\n 24. Under the IMM, the institution need not employ a single model. Although the following \\ntext describes an internal model as a simulation model, no particular form of model is required. \\n\\n\\n## Page 14\", 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 0, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199671', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 14\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 14 Analytical models are acceptable so long as they are subject to OSFI revi ew, meet all of the \\nrequirements set forth in this section and are applied to all material exposures subject to a CCR -\\nrelated capital charge as noted above, with the exception of long settlement transactions, which \\nare treated separately, and with the exception of those exposures that are immaterial in size and risk. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.9]  25. Expected exposure or peak exposure measures should be calculated based on a \\ndistribution of exposures that accounts for the possible non- normality of the distribution of \\nexposures, including the existence of leptokurtosis (“fat tails”), where appropriate. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.10]  26. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as the product of \\nalpha times Effective EPE, as specified below (except for counterparties that have been identified as having explicit specific wrong-way risk or specific right-way risk – see paragraph 65):  \\nEAD = α  × Effective EPE   (1) \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.11] \\n27. Effective EPE (“Expected Positive Exposure”) is computed by estimating expected \\nexposure ( EE\\nt) as the average exposure at future date t , where the average is taken across \\npossible future values of relevant market risk factors, such as interest rates, foreign exchange \\nrates, etc.  The internal model estimates EE as a series of future dates t 1, t2, t3…10. Specifically, \\n“Effective EE” is computed recursively, where the current date is denoted as t 0 and Effective \\nEEt0 equals current exposure: \\nEffective EEtk = max(Effective EE tk-1, EE tk)  (2) \\nwhere the current date i s denoted as t 0 and Effective EE t0 equals current exposure.   \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.12] \\n28. In this regard, “Effective EPE” is the average Effective EE during the first year of future \\nexposure. If all contracts in the netting set mature before one year, EPE is the average of expected exposure until all contracts in the netting set mature. Effective EPE is computed as a weighted average of Effective EE:  \\nmin(1 , )\\n1kyear maturity\\ntk\\nkEffective EPE EffectiveEE t\\n== ×∆ ∑  (3) \\nwhere the weights Δ tk = t k – t k-1 allows for the case when future exposure is calculated at \\ndates that are not equally spaced over time.  \\n \\n10  In theory, the expectations should be taken with respect to the actual probability distribution of future exposure \\nand not the risk- neutral one. OSFI recogni zes that practical considerations may make it more feasible to use the \\nrisk-neutral one. As a result, OSFI will not mandate which kind of forecasting distribution to employ.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 15\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 15 [Basel Framework, CRE 53.13]  \\n29. Alpha (α) is set equal to 1.4. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.14]  \\n \\n30. OSFI retains discretion to require a higher alpha based on a f irm’s CCR exposures. \\nFactors that may require a higher alpha include the low granularity of counterparties; particularly high exposures to general wrong- way risk; particularly high correlation of market values across \\ncounterparties; and other institution- specific characteristics of CCR exposures. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.15]  \\n7.1.5.2 Own estimates for alpha \\n31. Institutions may seek OSFI approval to compute internal estimates of alpha subject to a \\nfloor of 1.2, where alpha equals the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of \\ncounterparty exposure across counterparties (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE (denominator), assuming they meet certain operating requirements. Eligible institutions must meet all the operating requirements for internal estimates of EPE and must demonstrate that their internal estimates of alpha capture in the numerator the material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of market values of transactions or of portfolios of transactions across counterparties (e.g. the correlation of defaults across counterparties and between market risk and default). [Basel Framework, CRE 53.16]  \\n 32. In the denominator, EPE must be used as if it were a fixed outstanding loan amount. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.17]   33. To this end, institutions  must ensure that the numerator and denominator of alpha are \\ncomputed in a consistent fashion with respect to the modelling methodology, parameter specifications and portfolio composition. The approach used must be based on the firm’s internal economic cap ital approach, be well -documented and be subject to independent validation. In \\naddition, institutions must review their estimates on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time. Institutions must a ssess the \\nmodel risk given the significant variation in estimates of alpha can arise from the possibility for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator, especially where convexity is present . \\nThe assessment of model risk must be part of the independent model validation and approval process and model performance monitoring. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.18]   34. Where appropriate, volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint \\nsimulation of market and credit risk should be condit ioned on the credit risk factor to reflect \\npotential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn. Internal estimates of \\nalpha should take account of the granularity of exposures. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.19]  \\n7.1.5.3 Maturity  \\n35. If the original maturity of the longest -dated contract contained in the set is greater than \\none year, the formula for effective maturity (M) in Chapter 5 is replaced with the following:  \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 16\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 16  \\nwhere df k is the risk -free discount factor for future time period t k and the remaining symbols \\nare defined above. Similar to the treatment under corporate exposures, M has a cap of five \\nyears .11  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.20] \\n 36. For netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than one year, \\nthe formula for effective maturity (M) in Chapter 5 is unchanged and a floor of one year applies, \\nwith the exception of short-term exposures as described in Chapter 5 - Internal Ratings Based \\nApproach, section 5.4.1 (iv).  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.21] \\n37. For derivative contracts subject to paragraph 65 (SWWR) and st ructured such that on \\nspecified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of \\nthe contract is zero, the remaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \\n7.1.5.4 Margin agreements \\n38. If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the internal model captures the \\neffects of margining when estimating EE, the model’s EE measure may be used directly in equation (2). Such models are noticeably more complicated than models of EPE for unmargined counterparties. As such, they are subject to a higher degree of supervisory scrutiny before they are approved, as discussed below.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.22]  39. An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to capture the \\neffects of margining. It must take into account both the current amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model must account for the nature of margin agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model mus t either model the mark -to-market change in the \\nvalue of collateral posted or apply this guideline’s rules for collateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.23]  40. For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark- to-market valuation, a \\nsupervisory floor of five business days for netting sets consisting only of repo-style transactions, and 10 business days for all other netting sets is imposed on the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling EAD with margin agreements. In the following cases a higher supervisory floor is imposed: \\n \\n11  Conceptually, M equals the effective credit duration of the counterparty exposure. A bank that uses an internal model to \\ncalculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment (CVA) can use the effective credit duration estimated by such a model in \\nplace of the above formula w ith prior approval of OSIF.  ≤\\n= >\\n≤\\n=×∆ × + ×∆ ×\\n=\\n×∆ ×∑∑\\n∑1\\n11\\n1\\n1k\\nk\\nkt year maturity\\nk kk k kk\\nk t year\\nt year\\nk kk\\nkEffective EE t df EE t df\\nM\\nEffective EE t df\\n\\n\\n## Page 17\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 17 • for all netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5,000 at any point during a \\nquarter, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of risk for the following quarter;  \\n• for netting sets cont aining one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral, or an \\nOTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of risk. For these purposes, “Illiquid collateral” and “OTC derivatives that cannot be easily replaced” must be determined in the context of stressed market conditions and will be characteri zed by the absence of continuously \\nactive markets where a counterparty would, within two or fewer days, obtain multiple price quotat ions that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market \\ndiscount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC derivative). Examples of situations where trades are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, but are not l imited to, trades that are not marked daily and trades that are subject to specific \\naccounting treatment for valuation purposes (e.g., OTC derivatives or repo- style \\ntransactions referencing securities whose fair value is determined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).  \\n• in addition, an institution must consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the institution  would be able to replace its trades.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.24]  \\n 41. If an institution has experienced more than two margin call disputes on a particular \\nnetting set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the applicable margin period of risk (before consideration of this provision), then the institution must reflect this history appropriately by using a margin period of risk that is at least double the supervisory floor for that netting set for the subsequent two quarters. In the case of derivatives subject to Guideline E-22, this paragraph only applies to variation margin call disputes.  [Basel Framework, CRE \\n53.25]  \\n 42. For re -margining with a periodicity of N -days, the margin period of risk should be at \\nleast equal to the supervis ory floor, F, plus the N days minus one day. That is,  \\n Margin Period of Risk = F + N - 1. \\n \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.26]  \\n 43. Institutions using the IMM must not capture the effect of a reduction of EAD due to any \\nclause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.27]  \\n7.1.5.5 Model validation \\n44. In order to assure itself that institutions using models have counterparty credit risk \\nmanagement systems that are conceptually soun d and implemented with integrity, OSFI will \\nspecify a number of qualitative criteria that institutions would have to meet before they are \\n\\n\\n## Page 18\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 18 permitted to use a models -based approach. The extent to which institutions meet the qualitative \\ncriteria may influence the level at which OSFI will set the multiplication factor referred to in \\nparagraph 29 (Alpha). Only those institutions in full compliance with th e qualitative criteria will \\nbe eligible for application of the minimum multiplication factor. The qualitative criteria include:  \\n• the institution must conduct a regular programme of backtesting, i.e., an ex -post \\ncomparison of the risk measures12 generated by the model against reali zed risk \\nmeasures, as well as comparing hypothetical changes based on static positions with realized measures;  \\n• the institution must carry out an initial validation and an ongoing periodic review of its IMM model and the risk measures generated by it. The validation and review must be independent of the model developers;  \\n• senior management should be actively involved in the risk control process and must \\nregard credit and counterparty credit risk control as an essential aspect of the business \\nto which significant resources need to be devoted. In this regard, the daily reports \\nprepared by the independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient  seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of \\npositions taken by individual traders and reductions in the institution’s overall risk exposure;  \\n• the institution’s internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely integrated \\ninto the day- to-day risk management process of the institution. Its output should \\naccordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling \\nits counterparty credit risk profile;  \\n• the risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with inte rnal trading and \\nexposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits should be related to the institution’s risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit function and senior management;  \\n• institutions should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented \\nset of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation of the risk measurement system. The institution’s risk measurement system must be well documented, for example, through a risk management manual that describes the basic \\nprinciples of the risk management system and that provides an explanation of the empirical techniques used to measure counterparty credit risk;  \\n• an independent review of the risk measure ment system should be carried out regularly \\nin the institution’s own internal auditing process. This review should include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk control unit. A review of the overall risk management p rocess should take place at regular intervals \\n(ideally no less than once a year) and should specifically address, at a minimum:  \\no the adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and process;  \\n \\n12  “Risk measures” refers not only to Effective EPE, the risk measure used to derive regulatory capital, but also to \\nthe other risk measures used in the calculation of Effective EPE such as the exposure distribution at a series of \\nfuture dates, the positive exposure distribution at a series of future dates, the market risk factors used to derive \\nthose exposures and the values of the constituent trades of a portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 19\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 19 o the organi zation of the risk control unit;  \\no the inte gration of counterparty credit risk measures into daily risk management;  \\no the approval process for counterparty credit risk models used in the calculation \\nof counterparty credit risk used by front office and back office personnel;  \\no the validation of any sign ificant change in the risk measurement process;  \\no the scope of counterparty credit risks captured by the risk measurement model;  \\no the integrity of the management information system; \\no the accuracy and completeness of position data;  \\no the verification of the consi stency, timeliness and reliability of data sources \\nused to run internal models, including the independence of such data sources;  \\no the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions;  \\no the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation c alculations; and  \\no the verification of the model’s accuracy as described in paragraphs 45 to 48 . \\n• the ongoing validation of counterparty credit risk models, including backtesting, must be reviewed periodically by a level of management with sufficient authority to decide the course of action that will be taken to address weaknesses in the models. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.28]  \\n 45. Institutions must document the process for initial and ongoing validation of their IMM \\nmodel to a leve l of detail that would enable a third party to recreate the analysis. Institutions \\nmust also document the calculation of the risk measures generated by the models to a level of \\ndetail that would allow a third party to re -create the risk measures. This docu mentation must set \\nout the frequency with which backtesting analysis and any other ongoing validation will be conducted, how the validation is conducted with respect to data flows and portfolios and the analyses that are used. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.29]  \\n 46. Institutions must define criteria with which to assess their EPE models and the models \\nthat input into the calculation of EPE and have a written policy in place that describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be determined and remedied. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.30]  \\n \\n47. Institutions must define how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed for \\nthe purposes of validating an EPE model and its risk measures. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.31]  \\n \\n48. When validating EPE models and its risk measures that produce forecast distributions, \\nvalidation must assess more than a single statistic of the model distribution. [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 53.32]  \\n 49. As part of the initial and ongoing validation of an IMM model and its risk measures, the \\nfollowing require ments must be met: \\n\\n\\n## Page 20\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 20 • an institution must carry out backtesting using historical data on movements in market \\nrisk factors prior to OSFI approval. Backtesting must consider a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various start (initializ ation) dates and covering a wide range of market conditions;  \\n• institutions must backtest the performance of their EPE model and the model’s relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions that support EPE. For collaterali zed trades, the prediction time horizons considered must include those \\nreflecting typical margin periods of risk applied in collaterali zed/margined trading, and \\nmust include long time horizons of at least one  year;  \\n• the pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for a given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as part of the ini tial and \\nongoing model validation process. These pricing models may be different from those used to calculate Market Risk over a short horizon. Pricing models for options must account for the non- linearity of option value with respect to market risk factor s; \\n• an EPE model must capture transaction specific information in order to aggregate \\nexposures at the level of the netting set. Institutions must verify that transactions are \\nassigned to the appropriate netting set within the model;  \\n• static, historical backtesting on representative counterparty portfolios must be a part of the validation process. At regular intervals, an institution must conduct such backtesting on a number of representative counterparty portfolios. The representative portfolios must be chose n based on their sensitivity to the material risk factors and \\ncorrelations to which the institution is exposed. In addition, IMM institutions need to conduct backtesting that is designed to test the key assumptions of the EPE model and \\nthe relevant risk me asures, e.g. the modelled relationship between tenors of the same \\nrisk factor, and the modelled relationships between risk factors;  \\n• significant differences between reali zed exposures and the forecast distribution could \\nindicate a problem with the model or the underlying data that OSFI would require the institution to correct. Under such circumstances, OSFI may require additional capital to be held while the problem is being solved;  \\n• the performance of EPE models and its risk measures must be subject to good backtesting practice. The backtesting programme must be capable of identifying poor performance in an EPE model’s risk measures;  \\n• institutions must validate their EPE models and all relevant risk measures out to time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure is calculated using an internal modelling method;  \\n• the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure must be regularly tested against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the ongoing model validation process;  \\n• the ongoing validation of an institution’s EPE model and the relevant risk measures \\ninclude an assessment of recent performance;  \\n\\n\\n## Page 21\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 21 • the frequency with which the parameters of an EPE model are updated needs to be \\nassessed as part of the validation process;  \\n• unde r the IMM, a measure that is more conservative than the metric used to calculate \\nregulatory EAD for every counterparty, may be used in place of alpha times Effective EPE with prior approval from OSFI. The degree of relative conservatism will be assessed up on initial OSFI approval and at the regular supervisory reviews of the EPE \\nmodels. The institution must validate the conservatism regularly; \\n• the ongoing assessment of model performance needs to cover all counterparties for which the models are used;  \\n• the va lidation of IMM models must assess whether or not the institution level and \\nnetting set exposure calculations of EPE are appropriate.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.33]  \\n \\n50. In the case where the pricing model used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure \\nis different than the pricing model used to calculate Market Risk over a short horizon, OSFI \\nexpects institutions to provide documented justification for the use of two different pricing models, including an assessment of the resulting model risk. \\n7.1.5.6 Operational requirements for EPE models   \\n51. In order to be eligible to adopt an internal model for estimating EPE arising from CCR \\nfor regulatory capital purposes, an institution must meet the following operational requirements. \\nThese include meeting the requirements related to the qualifying standards on CCR Management, a use test, stress testing, identification of wrong- way risk, and internal controls. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.34]  \\n Qualifying standards on CCR Management  \\n 52. The institution must satisfy its supe rvisor that, in addition to meeting the operational \\nrequirements identified in paragraphs 53 to 82 below, it adheres to sound practices for CCR management.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.35]  \\n Use test  \\n 53. The distribution of exposures generated by the internal model used to calculate effective \\nEPE must be closely integrated into the day- to-day CCR management process of the institution. \\nFor example, the institution could use the peak exposure from the distri butions for counterparty \\ncredit limits or expected positive exposure for its internal allocation of capital. The internal model’s output must accordingly play an essential role in the credit approval, counterparty credit risk management, internal capital a llocations, and corporate governance of institutions that seek \\napproval to apply such models for capital adequacy purposes. Models and estimates designed and implemented exclusively to qualify for the internal models method are not acceptable. [ Basel \\nFrame work, CRE 53.36]  \\n  \\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 22 54. An institution must have a credible track record in the use of internal models that \\ngenerate a distribution of exposures to CCR. Thus, the institution must demonstrate that it has \\nbeen using an internal model to calculate the distributio ns of exposures upon which the EPE \\ncalculation is based that meets broadly the minimum requirements for at least one year prior to approval. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.37]  \\n \\n55. Institutions employing the internal model method must have an independent control uni t \\nthat is responsible for the design and implementation of the firm’s CCR management system, \\nincluding the initial and ongoing validation of the internal model. This unit must control input data integrity and produce and analyz e reports on the output of the firm’s risk measurement \\nmodel, including an evaluation of the relationship between measures of risk exposure and credit and trading limits. This unit must be independent from business credit and trading units; it must be adequately staffed; it must repor t directly to senior management of the firm. The work of this \\nunit should be closely integrated into the day -to-day credit risk management process of the firm. \\nIts output should accordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling the firm’s credit and overall risk profile. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.38]  \\n 56. Institutions applying the IMM must have a collateral management unit that is \\nresponsible for calculating and making margin calls, managing margin call disputes and reporting levels of independent amounts, initial margins and variation margins accurately on a daily basis. This unit must control the integrity of the data used to make margin calls, and ensure that it is consistent and reconciled regularly with all relevant sourc es of data within the \\ninstitution. This unit must also track the extent of reuse of collateral (both cash and non- cash) \\nand the rights that the institution gives away to its respective counterparties for the collateral that it posts. These internal reports  must indicate the categories of collateral assets that are reused, \\nand the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit quality and maturity. The unit must also track concentration to individual collateral asset classes accepted by the institutions. S enior \\nmanagement must allocate sufficient resources to this unit for its systems to have an appropriate level of operational performance, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of outgoing calls and response time to incoming calls. Senior management must ensure that this unit is adequately staffed to process calls and disputes in a timely manner even under severe market crisis, and to enable the institution to limit its number of large disputes caused by trade volumes. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.39]  \\n 57. The institution’s collateral management unit must produce and maintain appropriate \\ncollateral management information that is reported on a regular basis to senior management. Such internal reporting should include information on the type of collateral (bot h cash and non-\\ncash) received and posted, as well as the size, aging and cause for margin call disputes.

The internal model used to generate the distribution of exposures must be part of a \\ncounterparty risk management framework that includes the identification, measurement, \\nmanagement, approval and internal reporting of counterparty risk.\\n13 This framework must \\ninclude the measurement of usage of credit lines (aggregating counterparty exposures with other \\ncredit exposure s) and economic capital allocation. In addition to EPE (a measure of future \\nexposure), an institution must measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the institution must measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held. The use test  is \\nsatisfied if an institution uses other counterparty risk measures, such as peak exposure or \\npotential future exposure (PFE), based on the distribution of exposures generated by the same \\nmodel to compute EPE.

An institution  is not required to estimate or report EE daily, but to meet the use test it \\nmust have the systems capability to estimate EE daily, if necessary, unless it demonstrates to OSFI that its exposures to CCR warrant some less frequent calculation. It must choos e a time \\nprofile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future cash flows and maturity of the contracts. For example, an institution may compute EE on a daily basis for the first 10 days, once a week out to one month, once a  month out to 18 months, once a quarter out \\nto five years and beyond five years in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposure. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.43]  \\n 61. Exposure must be measured out to the life of all contracts in the netting set (not just to \\nthe one -year horizon), monitored and controlled. The institution must have procedures in place to \\nidentify and control the risks for counterparties where exposure rises beyond the one -year \\nhorizon. Moreover, the forecasted inc rease in exposure must be an input into the firm’s internal \\neconomic capital model.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.44]  \\n Stress testing  \\n 62. An institution must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the \\nassessment of capital adequacy. These stress m easures must be compared against the measure of \\nEPE and considered by the institution as part of its internal capital adequacy assessment process. Stress testing must also involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on a firm’s credit exposures and assessment of the firm’s ability to withstand such changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are; (i) economic or industry downturns, (ii) market -place events, or (iii) decreased liquid ity conditions. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.45]  \\n 63. Institutions must have a comprehensive stress testing program for counterparty credit \\nrisk. The stress testing program must include the following elements:  \\n \\n13  This section draws heavily on the Counterparty Risk Manageme nt Policy Group’s paper, Improving Counterparty Risk \\nManagement Practices  (June 1999)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 24\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 24 • institutions must ensure complete trade capture and exposure aggregation across all \\nforms of counterparty credit risk (not just OTC derivatives) at the counterparty- specific \\nlevel in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing; \\n• for all counterparties, institutions should produce, at least monthly, exposure stress testing of principal market risk factors (e.g. interest rates, FX, equities, credit spreads, and commodity prices) in order to proactively identify, and when necessary, reduce outsized concentrations to specific directional sensiti vities;  \\n• institutions should apply multi -factor stress testing scenarios and assess material non -\\ndirectional risks (i.e. , yield curve exposure, basis risks, etc.) at least quarterly. Multiple -\\nfactor stress tests should, at a minimum, aim to address scenario s in which a) severe \\neconomic or market events have occurred; b) broad market liquidity has decreased significantly; and c) the market impact of liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary. These stress tests may be part of institution -wide str ess testing;  \\n• stressed market movements have an impact not only on counterparty exposures, but \\nalso on the credit quality of counterparties. At least quarterly, institutions should \\nconduct stress testing applying stressed conditions to the joint movement of  exposures \\nand counterparty creditworthiness;  \\n• exposure stress testing (including single factor, multifactor and material non- directional \\nrisks) and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness should be performed at the counterparty- specific, counterparty group (e.g. industry and region), and aggregate \\ninstitution -wide CCR levels;  \\n• stress tests results should be integrated into regular reporting to senior management. The analysis should capture the largest counterparty- level impacts across the portfolio,  \\nmaterial concentrations within segments of the portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends;  \\n• the severity of factor shocks should be consistent with the purpose of the stress test. When evaluating  solvency under stress, factor shocks should be severe enough to \\ncapture historical extreme market environments and/or extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The impact of such shocks on capital resources should be evaluated, as well as the impa ct on capital requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day- to-\\nday portfolio monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations, institutions should also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability;  \\n• institutions should consider reve rse stress tests to identify extreme, but plausible, \\nscenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes;  \\n• senior management must take a lead role in the integration of stress testing into the risk management framework and risk culture of the instit ution and ensure that the results \\nare meaningful and proactively used to manage counterparty credit risk. At a minimum, the results of stress testing for significant exposures should be compared to guidelines that express the institution’s risk appetite an d elevated for discussion and action when \\nexcessive or concentrated risks are present.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.46]  \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 25\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 25 Wrong- way risk  \\n \\n64. Institutions must identify exposures that give rise to a greater degree of general wrong -\\nway risk. Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify risk factors that are positively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness. Such testi ng needs to address the \\npossibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed. \\nInstitutions should monitor general wrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by \\nother categories that are germane to the busin ess. Reports should be provided to senior \\nmanagement on a regular basis that communicate wrong way risks and the steps that are being taken to manage that risk.  [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.47]  \\n 65. An institution is exposed to “specific wrong- way risk” (SWWR) if  future exposure to a \\nspecific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. For example, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong -way exposures for the \\nbuyer that is specific to the counterparty. An institution must have procedures in place to identify, monitor and control cases of SWWR, beginning at the inception of a trade and continuing through the life of the trade. To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single -name credit de fault swaps \\nwhere there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals the full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the underlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the underlying instrument allows the institution to recogni ze, in respect of such swap, the market \\nvalue that has been lost a lready and any expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for Advanced or \\nFoundation IRB institutions must be set to 100% for such swap transactions .\\n14 For institutions \\nusing the s tandardi zed approach for credit risk, the risk weight to use is that of an unsecured \\ntransaction. For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. referencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying company, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD equals the value of the transaction under the assumption of a jump- to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this \\nmakes re- use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC)  that already contain an \\nLGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%. LGD for Advanced and Foundation IRB banks will be that of an unsecured exposure. For institutions using the s tandardized a pproach for credit \\nrisk, the risk weight of an unsecured transac tion should be used.  \\n \\nThe counterparty credit risk arising from trades where SWWR has been identified can be \\nmitigated through either prepayment or the collection of independent collateral amounts.

The capital \\nrequirements for such underlying exposure are to be calculated without reduction for the swap which introduces \\nwrong way risk.

An institution is exposed to “specific right -way risk” (SRWR) if the future exposure to a \\nspecific counterparty is highly inversely correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. An example of SRWR are warrants, which can be a component of  call spread \\noverlay trades written  by the counterparty on the counterparty’s stock.   \\n67. There are transactions where SRWR is present and, given the structure of these, \\ninstitutions will have a zero EAD to the counterparty if the counterparty defaults.   \\n68. Where an institution has identified SRWR, only the trade types identified in paragraph \\n69 below, and subject to due diligence ,\\n15 are permitted to receive a zero EAD. Institutions \\nwishing to add other trade types should contact OSFI’s Ca pital Division for prior permission.  \\n69. Permitted trade types include: \\n• An equity warrant , or option in each case written by the counterparty on the \\ncounterparty’s own stock  purchased as part of a call spread overlay transaction, where \\na bond hedge has also be en purchased. Call spread overlay transactions involve a \\ncounterparty issuing convertible bonds and wishing to synthetically increase the \\nconversion price.  \\n• Issuer forward as well as issuer r ange forward sales of equity whereby the institution \\nhas also simu ltaneously shorted the shares of the counterparty. Issuer and issuer range \\nforward sales of equity are typically done by a counterparty, with future capital expenditures or other funding needs, wishing to lock in a favourable current stock price or range of stock prices  without needing to issue shares until the maturity of the \\nforward or range forward transaction.  \\n• Accelerated share repurchase agreements whereby counterparties provide an \\ninstitution with funds to buy back shares in a defined peri od of time (typically under \\nsix months). \\n \\n15 Trade types listed in paragraph 69 do not automatically qualify for a zero EAD.

Other operational requirements focus on the internal controls needed to ensure the \\nintegrity of model inputs; specifically, the requirements address the transaction data, historical \\nmarket data, frequency of calculation, and valuation models used in measuring EPE. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.49]  \\n \\n71. The internal model must reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, \\ncomplete, and conservative fashion. Such terms include, but a re not limited to, contract notional \\namounts, maturity, reference assets, collateral thresholds, margining arrangements, netting arrangements, etc. The terms and specifications must reside in a secure database that is subject to formal and periodic audit. The process for recogni zing netting arrangements must require signoff \\nby legal staff to verify the legal enforceability of netting and be input into the database by an independent unit. The transmission of transaction terms and specifications data to the i nternal \\nmodel must also be subject to internal audit and formal reconciliation processes must be in place between the internal model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least conservatively. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.50]  \\n 72. When  the Effective EPE model is calibrated using historic market data, the institution \\nmust employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least three years of historical d ata must be used to estimate parameters of the model. Alternatively, market implied \\ndata may be used to estimate parameters of the model. In all cases, the data must be updated quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. To calculate the Eff ective EPE using a \\nstress calibration, the institution must also calibrate Effective EPE using three years of data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of an institution’s counterparties or calibrate Effective EPE using market implied data from a suitable period of stress. The following process will be used to assess the adequacy of the stress calibration:  \\n• The institution must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period coincides with a period of increased CDS or other credit spreads – such as loan or corporate bond spreads \\n– for a representative selection of the institution’s counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the institution does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, the institution should map each counterparty to specific credit spread data based on region, internal rating and business types. \\n• The exposure model for all counterparties must use data, either historic or implied, that includes the data from the stressed credit period, and must use such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration of the Effective EPE model to current data.  \\n [Basel Framework, CRE 53.52]  \\n 73. When two different calibration methods are used for different parameters within the \\nEffective EPE model, OSFI expects institutions’ model development and validation groups to provide documented justification for the choice of calibration methods that includes an assessment of the resulting model risk.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 28\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 28  \\n74. If an institution wished to recogni ze in its EAD calculations for OTC derivatives the \\neffect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, then it must model collateral jointly with the exposure. If the institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure then it must use either haircuts that meet the standards of the financial collateral \\ncomprehensive method with own haircut estimates or the standard supervisory haircuts. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.52]  \\n \\n75. If the internal model includes the effect of collateral on changes in the market value of \\nthe netting set, the institution must model collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself jointly wi th the exposure in its EAD calculations for securities -financing \\ntransactions. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.53]  \\n 76. The EPE model (and modifications made to it) must be subject to an internal model \\nvalidation process. The process must be clearly articulated in fi rms’ policies and procedures. The \\nvalidation process must specify the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which assumptions are violated and may result in an understatement of EPE. The validation process must incl ude a review of the comprehensiveness of the EPE model, for \\nexample such as whether the EPE model covers all products that have a material contribution to counterparty risk exposures.

The use of an internal model to estimate E PE, and hence the exposure amount or EAD, \\nof positions subject to a CCR capital charge will be conditional upon the explicit OSFI approval.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.55]  \\n \\n78. The BCBS has issued guidance regarding the use of internal models to estimate certain \\nparameters of risk and determine minimum capital charges against those risks. OSFI requires that institutions seeking to make use of internal models to estimate EPE meet similar requirements regarding, for example, the integrity of the risk managem ent system, the skills of staff that will \\nrely on such measures in operational areas and in control functions, the accuracy of models, and the rigour of internal controls over relevant internal processes. As an example, institutions seeking to make use of an internal model to estimate EPE must demonstrate that they meet the \\nCommittee’s general criteria for institutions seeking to make use of internal models to assess market risk exposures, but in the context of assessing counterparty credit risk.\\n16 [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.56]  \\n 79.

For capital adequacy purposes, institutions may net transactions (e.g., when determining \\nthe RC component of a netting set) subject to novation under which any obligation between an institution and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for th e same currency and value date, legally substituting \\none single amount for the previous gross obligations.

An example of such an instance would be Specific Wrong Way Risk (WWR) transac tions which are \\nrequired to each be moved to their own standalone netting set.   \\n21  The netting contract must not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or n o payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting \\nparty, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 33\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 33 • The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the \\nforeign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;  \\n• The law that governs the individual transactions; and  \\n• The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to affect the netting. \\nOSFI, after consultation when necessary with other relevant supervisors, must be satisfied that the netting is enforceable under the laws of each of the relev ant \\njurisdictions .\\n22 \\n(iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting arrangements are kept under review in light of the possible changes in relevant law.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.7]  \\n 104. There are two formulations of replacement cost de pending on whether the trades with a \\ncounterparty are subject to a margin agreement. Where a margin agreement exists, the formulation could apply both to bilateral transactions and central clearing relationships. The formulation also addresses the various arrangements that an institution may have to post and/or receive collateral that may be referred to as initial margin. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.9]  \\n A. Formulation for unmargined transactions  \\n 105. For unmargined transactions (that is, where VM is not exchanged, but collateral other \\nthan VM may be present), RC is defined as the greater of: (i) the current market value of the derivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by the institution (if any ), and (ii) zero. This is \\nconsistent with the use of replacement cost as the measure of current exposure, meaning that when the institution owes the counterparty money it has no exposure to the counterparty if it can instantly replace its trades and sell c ollateral at current market prices. Mathematically:   \\n RC = max{ V-C,0} \\nwhere V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set and C is the haircut value of net collateral held, which is calculated in accordance with the NICA methodology defined in paragraph 112. For this purpose , the value of non- cash collateral posted by the institution to its \\ncounterparty is increased and the value of the non- cash collateral received by the institution from \\nits counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same as those that apply to repo -style \\ntransactions) for the time periods described in paragraph 100.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.10 and 52.11]  \\n 106. In the above formulation, it is assumed that the replacement cost representing today’s \\nexposure to the counterparty cannot go less than zero. However, institutions sometimes hold excess collateral (even in the absence of a margin agreement) or have out -of-the-money trades \\nwhich can further protect the institution from the increase of the exposure. As discussed in paragraphs 116 to 118, the SA -CCR would allow such over -collaterali zation and negative mark-\\n \\n22  Thus, if any of these supervisors is dissatisfied about enforceability under its laws, the netting contract or \\nagreement will not meet this condition and neither counterparty could obtain supervisory benefit.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 34\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 34 to market value to reduce PFE, but would not affect replacement cost .

Bilateral transactions with a one -way margining agreement in favour of the institution’s \\ncounterparty (that is, where an institution posts, but does not collect, collateral) must be treated \\nas unmargined transactions. [ Basel Framewor k, CRE 52.10, FAQ #1]  \\n \\nB. Formulation for margined transactions  \\n 108. The RC formula for margined transactions builds on the RC formula for unmargined \\ntransactions. It also employs concepts used in standard margining agreements, as discussed more fully below. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.13]  \\n 109. The RC for margined transactions in the SA -CCR is defined as the greatest exposure \\nthat would not trigger a call for VM, taking into account the mechanics of collateral exchanges in margining agreements. Such mechanics include, for example, “Threshold”, “Minimum Transfer Amount” and “Independent Amount” in the standard industry documentation,\\n23 which are \\nfactored into a call for VM .24 [Basel Framework, CRE 52.14]  \\n C. Incorporating NICA into replacement cost  \\n 110. One objective of the SA -CCR is to more fully reflect the effect of margining agreements \\nand the associated exchange of collateral in the calculation of CCR exposures. The following paragraphs address how the exchange of collateral is incorporated into the SA -CCR. [ Basel \\nFramew ork, CRE 52.15]  \\n 111. To avoid confusion surrounding the use of terms initial margin and independent amount \\nwhich are used in various contexts and sometimes interchangeably, the term independent collateral amount (ICA) is introduced. ICA represents (i) collater al (other than VM) posted by \\nthe counterparty that the institution may seize upon default of the counterparty, the amount of which does not change in response to the value of the transactions it secures and/or (ii) the Independent Amount  (IA) parameter as defined in standard industry documentation. ICA can \\nchange in response to factors such as the value of the collateral or a change in the number of transactions in the netting set. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.16]  \\n 112. Because both an institution and its counterpar ty may be required to post ICA, it is \\nnecessary to introduce a companion term, net independent collateral amount ( NICA ), to describe \\nthe amount of collateral that an institution may use to offset its exposure on the default of the \\n \\n23  For example, the 1992 (Multicurrency- Cross Border) Master Agreement and the 2002 Master Agreement \\npublished by the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc.

NICA does not include collateral that an institution has posted to a segregated, \\nbankruptcy remote account, which presumably would be returned upon the bankruptcy of the counterparty. That is, NICA represents any collateral (segregated or unsegregated) posted by the counterparty less the unsegregated collateral posted by the institution. With respect to IA, NICA takes into account the differential of IA required for the institution minus IA required for the \\ncounterparty. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.17]  \\n \\n113. For margined trad es, the replacement cost is:  \\nRC = max{ V – C; TH + MTA – NICA;0}  \\nWhere: V and C are defined as in the unmargined formulation, except that C now includes the \\nnet variation margin amount, where the amount received by the institution is accounted with a posit ive sign and the amount posted by the institution is accounted with a negative sign, TH is \\nthe positive threshold before the counterparty must send the institution collateral, and MTA is \\nthe minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty. [ Basel Fr amework, CRE 52.18]  \\n 114. TH + MTA – NICA represents the largest exposure that would not trigger a VM call and \\nit contains levels of collateral that need always to be maintained. For example, without initial margin or IA, the greatest exposure that would not trigger a variation margin call is the threshold plus any minimum transfer amount. In the adapted formulation, NICA is subtracted from TH + MTA . This makes the calculation more accurate by fully reflecting both the actual level of \\nexposure that would not trigger a margin call and the effect of collateral held and/or posted by an \\ninstitution. The calculation is floored at zero, recogni zing that the institution may hold NICA in \\nexcess of TH + MTA , which could otherwise result in a negative replacement cost. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 52.19]  \\n7.1.7.2 PFE Add -ons \\n115. The PFE add -on consists of (i) an aggregate add- on component, which consists of add-\\nons calculated for each asset class and (ii) a multiplier that allows for the recognition of excess collateral or negative mark -to-market value for the transactions . Mathematically:  \\nPFE = multiplier ×  AddOn\\naggregate \\n \\nWhere AddOnaggregate is the aggregate add -on component and multiplier is defined as a \\nfunction of three inputs: V, C and AddOnaggregate. \\n The paragraphs below describe the inputs that enter into the calculation of the add- on formulas in \\nmore detail, and set out the formula fo r each asset class.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.20]  \\n \\n7.1.7.3 Recognition of excess collateral and negative mark -to-market  \\n116. As a general principle, over -collaterali zation should reduce capital requirements for \\ncounterparty credit risk. In fact, many institutions hold excess collateral (i.e. , collateral greater \\nthan the net market value of the derivatives contracts) precisely to offset potential increases in \\n\\n\\n## Page 36\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 36 exposure represented by the add- on. As discussed in paragraphs 105 and 113, collateral may \\nreduce the replacement cost component of th e exposure under the SA -CCR. The PFE component \\nalso reflects the risk -reducing property of excess collateral. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.21]  \\n117. For prudential reasons and in line with Basel Committee direction, OSFI applied a \\nmultiplier to the PFE component tha t decreases as excess collateral increases, without reaching \\nzero (the multiplier is floored at 5% of the PFE add -on). When the collateral held is less than the \\nnet market value of the derivative contracts (“under -collaterali zation”), the current replacement \\ncost is positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the full \\nvalue of the aggregate add -on). Where the collateral held is greater than the net market value of \\nthe derivative contracts (“over -collaterali zation”), the current replacement cost is zero and the \\nmultiplier is less than one (i.e. the PFE component is less than the full value of the aggregate add-on). [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.22]  \\n118. This multiplier will also be activated when the current value of the derivative \\ntransactions is negative. This is because out -of-the-money transactions do not currently represent \\nan exposure and have less chance to go in- the-money.

The designation of a derivative transaction to an asset class is be made on the basis of \\nits primary risk driver. Most derivative transaction s have one primary risk driver, defined by its \\nreference underlying instrument (e.g., an interest rate curve for an interest rate swap, a reference entity for a credit default swap, a foreign exchange rate for a FX call option, etc). When this \\nprimary risk  driver is clearly identifiable, the transaction will fall into one of the asset classes \\ndescribed above.

For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g., multi- asset or \\nhybrid derivatives), institutions m ust take sensitivities and volatility of the underlying into \\naccount for determining the primary risk driver.   \\nOSFI may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one asset class, \\nresulting in the same position being included in multiple  classes. In this case, for each asset class \\nto which the position is allocated, institutions must determine appropriately the sign and delta \\nadjustment of the relevant risk driver.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.27 and 52.28]  \\n \\n7.1.7.6 General steps for calculating the add- on \\n \\n122. For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and \\nattributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity or commodity. The add- on for each asset class is calculated usin g asset -class -specific formulas \\nthat represent a styli zed Effective EPE calculation under the assumption that all trades in the \\nasset class have zero current mark -to-market value (i.e. they are at -the-money). [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 52.29]  \\n123. Although the add -on formulas are asset class -specific, they have a number of features in \\ncommon. To determine the add- on, transactions in each asset class are subject to adjustment in \\nthe following general steps:  \\n1) The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each individual trade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the sensitivity of the trade to movements in the underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, exchange rates, credit spreads, e quity prices and commodity prices). The effective notional is calculated as the \\nproduct of the following parameters (i.e. D = d ×  MF ×  δ): \\na. The adjustment notional (d) . The adjusted notional is a measure of the size of \\nthe trade. For derivatives in the fore ign exchange asset class this is simply the \\nnotional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative contracted, converted to the domestic currency. For derivatives in the equity and commodity asset classes, it is simply the current price of the releva nt share or unit of commodity \\nmultiplied by the number of shares/units that the derivative references. For derivatives in the interest rate and credit asset classes, the notional amount is adjusted by a measure of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that the value of the instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to movements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads).  \\nb. The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes account of the  time period over which the potential future exposure is calculated. The \\ncalculation of the maturity factor varies depending on whether the netting set is margined or unmargined.  \\nc. The supervisory delta (δ). The supervisory delta ensures the effective notional takes into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, by having a positive or negative sign. It is also takes into account whether the \\n\\n\\n## Page 38', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 2, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199758', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 38\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 38 trade has a non -linear relationship with the underlying risk factor (which is the \\ncase for options and collateralized debt obligation tranches).  \\n2) A supervisory factor (SF)  is identified for each individual trade in the netting set.

The purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where long and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the potential future exposure. \\n4) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory \\nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset -class level to give \\nthe asset class level add -on. The method of aggregation varies between assets classes and \\nfor credit, equity and commodity derivatives.

This time period appears in the maturity factor defined in paragraphs 139 to 144 that scales down adjusted notional for unmargine d trades for all asset classes. If a derivative contract has another derivative \\ncontract as its underlying (for example, a swaption) and may be physically exercised into the underlying contract (i.e., an institution would assume a position in the underlying contract in the event of exercise), then maturity of the contract is the time period until the final settlement date of the underlying derivative contract.  \\n• For interest rate and credit derivatives,  S\\ni is the period of time (starting today) until the \\nstart of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract.

In many cases the trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity. Wh en \\nthis is not the case, institutions must use the following rules to determine the trade notional amount. \\n• Where the notional is a formula of market values, the institution must enter the current \\nmarket values to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a ll interest rate and credit derivatives with variable notional amounts specified in the \\ncontract (such as amorti zing and accreting swaps), institutions must use the average \\nnotional over the remaining life of the swap as the trade notional amount. The aver age \\nshould be calculated as “time weighted”. The averaging described in this paragraph does \\nnot cover transactions where the notional varies due to price changes (typically FX, \\nequity and commodity derivatives).  \\n• Leveraged swaps must be converted to the not ional of the equivalent unleveraged swap, \\nthat is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated notional must be multiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is multiplied by the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the \\nremaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \\n \\n26  There is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining maturity of the \\nderivative contract.

The size of the position in the collar components must be such \\nthat the digital payoff is reproduced exactly outside of the region between the two strikes. \\nThe effective notional is then computed for the bought and sold European components of the collar separately, using the option formulas for the supervisory delta in paragraph 132 \\n(the exercise date \\niT and the current value of the underlying iP of the digital option must \\nbe used). The absolute value of the digital option effective notional must be capped by the \\nratio of the digital payoff to the relevant supervisory factor. \\n• If a trade’s payoff can be represented as a combination of European option payoffs (e.g. collar, butterfly/calendar spread, straddle, strangle, etc.), each European option component must be treated as a separate trade.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.42] \\n \\n• \\nFor the purposes of effective notional calculations, multi -payment options must be represented \\nas a combination of single-payment options.

The calibration of the supervisory factors for equity derivatives rely on estimates of the \\nmarket volatility of equity indices, with the application of a conservative beta factor38 to translate \\nthis estimate into an estimate of individual volatilities.[Basel Framework, CRE 52.67]  \\n158.  Institutions are not permitted to make any modelling assumptions in the calculation of \\nthe PFE add -ons, including estimating individual volatiliti es or taking publicly available \\nestimates of beta. This is a pragmatic approach to ensure a consistent implementation across \\njurisdictions but also to keep the add -on calculation relatively simple and prudent. Therefore, \\nonly two values of supervisory fact ors have been defined for equity derivatives, one for single \\nentities and one for indices.  \\n \\n38 The beta of an individual equity measures the volatility of the stock relative to a broad market index. A value of \\nbeta greater than one means the individual equity is more volatile than the index. The greater the beta is, the \\nmore volatile the stock. The beta is calculated by running a linear regression of the stock on the broad index.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 52\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 52  [Basel Framework, CRE52.68]  \\n7.1.7.18  Add-on for commodity derivatives  \\n159. The calculation  of the add -on for the commodity derivative asset class is similar to the \\ncalculation of the add -on for the credit and equity derivative asset classes. It recognizes the full \\noffsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that reference the same type of underlying \\ncommodity. It also allows partial offsetting between derivatives that reference different types of \\ncommodity, however, this partial offsetting is only permitted within each of the four hedging sets \\nof the commodity derivative asset class, where the different commodity types are more likely to demonstrate some stable, meaningful joint dynamics. Offsetting between hedging sets is not recogni zed (e.g. a forward contract on crude oil cannot hedge a forward contract on corn). [Basel \\nframework, C RE 52.69]  \\n160. The add -on for the commodity derivative asset class (AddOn\\nCommodity) within a netting \\nset is calculated using the following steps:  \\n(1) Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set that is in the commodity derivative asset class. This is calculated as the product of the following three terms: (i) the adjusted notional of the trade (d); (ii) the supervisory delta adjustment of \\nthe trade ( δ); and (iii) the maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, D\\ni = d i × δi × \\nMF i. \\n(2) Step 2: Allocate the trades in the commodity derivative asset class to hedging sets. In the \\ncommodity derivative asset class there are four hedging sets consisting of derivatives that reference: energy, metals, agriculture and other commodit ies. \\n(3) Step 3: Calculate the combined effective notional for all derivatives within each hedging set that reference the same commodity type (e.g. , all derivatives that reference copper \\nwithin the metals hedging set). The combined effective notional of the co mmodity type \\n(EN\\nComType ) is calculated by adding together the trade level effective notionals calculated \\nin step 1 that reference the commodity type. \\n(4) Step 4: Calculate the add -on for each commodity type (AddOn ComType ) within each \\nhedging set by multiplying the combined effective notional for that commodity calculated in step 3 by the supervisory factor that is specified for that commodity type (SF\\nComType ). \\nThe supervisory factors are set out in Table 2 in paragraph 162 and are set to 40% for \\nelectricity derivatives and 18% for derivatives that reference all other types of \\ncommodities.  \\n(5) Step 5: Calculate the add -on for each of the four commodi ty hedging sets (AddOn HS) by \\nusing the formula that follows. In the formula the summations are across all commodity \\ntypes within the hedging set, AddOn ComType  is the add -on amount calculated in step 4 for \\neach commodity type and ρ ComType  is the supervisory prescribed correlation factor \\ncorresponding to the commodity type.

Regarding the calculation steps above, defining individual commodity types is \\noperationally difficult. In fact, it is impossible to  fully specify all relevant distinctions between \\ncommodity types so that all basis risk is captured. For example crude oil could be a commodity \\ntype within the energy hedging set, but in certain cases this definition could omit a substantial \\nbasis risk bet ween different types of crude oil (West Texas Intermediate, Brent, Saudi Light, etc). \\nAlso, the four commodity type hedging sets have been defined without regard to characteristics \\nsuch as location and quality. For example, the energy hedging set contains commodity types such \\nas crude oil, electricity, natural gas and coal.

If multiple margin agreements apply to a single netting set, (for example: one Credit \\nSupport Annex [CSA] for VM and one for Initial Margin [IM]), all collateral collected against the netting set in question can be used to offset exposures as if it were collected in a single netting set, provided the institution has performed sufficient legal review to ensure the requirements of paragraph 103 are satisfied.  \\nWhen multiple CSAs apply to an individual netting set, the RC and PFE are calculated as follows:  \\nRC \\n• The V and C terms should consider all transactions within a netting set, across all CSAs; and \\n• The TH + MTA - NICA is the sum of the thresholds and MTAs across all CSA \\nagreement.  \\n \\nPFE \\n• In the multiplier term, similarly to RC, the V and C terms should consider all transactions  \\nin the netting set across all CSA agreements; and  \\n• The margin period of risk applied to calculate effective notionals is specific to the individual CSA to which a trade belongs. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.74] \\n\\n\\n## Page 55\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 55  \\n166. If a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets, special treatment is \\nnecessary because it is problematic to allocate the common collateral to individual netting sets. The replacement cost at any given time is determined by the sum of two terms. The first term is equal to the unmargined current exposure of the institution to the counterparty aggregated across \\nall netting sets within the margin agreement reduced by the positive current net collateral (i.e. \\ncollateral is subtracted only when the institution is a net holder of collatera l). The second term is \\nnon-zero only when the institution is a net poster of collateral: it is equal to the current net posted \\ncollateral (if there is any) reduced by the unmargined current exposure of the counterparty to the \\ninstitution aggregated across all netting sets within the margin agreement. Net collateral available to the institution should include both VM and NICA. Mathematically, RC for the entire margin agreement is: \\n𝑀𝑀𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴=𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚��𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚{𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆;0}−𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚{𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴;0};0\\n𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴�+𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚��𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚{𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆;0}−𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚{𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴;0};0\\n𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴� \\nwhere the summation 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴is across the netting sets covered by the margin agreement \\n(hence the notation), V NS is the current mark -to-market value of the netting set NS and C MA is the \\ncash equivalent value of all currently avail able collateral under the margin agreement.  \\n[Basel Framework 52.75]  \\n 167. Where a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets as described in \\nparagraph 166, collateral will be exchanged based on mark -to-market values that are netted \\nacross all transactions covered under the margin agreement, irrespective of netting sets. That is, collateral exch anged on a net basis may not be sufficient to cover PFE.  \\nIn this situation, therefore, the PFE add -on must be calculated according to the unmargined \\nmethodology. Netting set -level PFEs are then aggregated.

Netting sets with positive market values must first be allocated collateral up to the amount of those market values. Only after all positi ve market values have been compensated may surplus \\ncollateral be attributed freely among all netting sets.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 56\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 56 • If the institution is a net provider of collateral (C<0), all of the individual amounts \\nallocated to the individual netting sets must also be negativ e or zero. Netting sets with \\nnegative market values must first be allocated collateral up to the amount of their market values. If the collateral provided is larger than the sum of the negative market values, then all multipliers must be set equal to 1 and  no allocation is necessary.  \\n• The allocated parts must add up to the total collateral available for the margin agreement.  \\n Apart from these limitations, institutions may allocate available collateral at their discretion. The multiplier is then calculated pe r netting set according to paragraph 118 taking the allocated \\namount of collateral into account.  \\n[Basel Framework 52.76]  \\n168. Eligible collateral which is taken outside a netting set, but is available to a bank to offset \\nlosses due to counterparty default on one netting set only, should be treated as an independent collateral amount associated with the netting set and used within  the calculation of replacement \\ncost in paragraph 105 when the netting set is unmargined and in paragraph 113 when the netting \\nset is margined. Eligible collateral which is taken outside a netting set, and is available to a bank to offset losses due to counterparty default on more than one nett ing set, should be treated as \\ncollateral taken under a margin agreement applicable to multiple netting sets, in which case the treatment in paragraphs 166 and 167 applies.

The risk weight applied to collateral posted to the CCP by the institution must be determined in accordance with paragraphs 185 to 188. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.7]  \\n176. The exposure amount for such trade exposur e is to be calculated in accordance with this \\nchapter using the IMM or the SACCR, as consistently applied by such an institution to such an exposure in the ordinary course of its business, or Chapter 4 for collaterali zed transactions.

The two conditions referenced in paragraph 181 above are:  \\n(1) The offsetting transactions are identified by the CCP as client transactions and collateral \\nto support them is held by the CCP and/or the clearing member, as applicable, under arrangements that prevent any losses to the client due to: (a) the default or insolvency of the clearing member;  (b) the default or insolvency of the clearing member’s other clients; \\nand (c) the joint default or insolvency of the clearing member and any of its other clients. Regarding the condition set out in this paragraph:  \\na. Upon the insolvency of the clearing member, there must be no legal impediment (other than the need to obtain a court order to which the client is entitled) to the transfer of the collateral belonging to clients of a defaulting clearing member to the CCP, t o one or more other surviving clearing members or to the client or the \\nclient’s nominee.  \\nb. The client must have conducted a sufficient legal review (and undertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability) and have a well founded basis to conclude that, in the event of legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find that such arrangements mentioned above would be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the relevant laws of the relevant jurisdictio n(s). \\n(2) Relevant laws, regulation, rules, contractual, or administrative arrangements provide that the offsetting transactions with the defaulted or insolvent clearing member are highly likely to continue to be indirectly transacted through the CCP, or by the CCP, if the clearing member defaults or becomes insolvent. In such circumstances, the client \\npositions and collateral with the CCP will be transferred at market value unless the client requests to close out the position at market value. Regarding the condition set out in this paragraph, if there is a clear precedent for transactions being ported at a CCP and industry intent for this practice to continue, then these factors must be considered when assessing if trades are highly likely to be ported. The fac t that CCP documentation does \\nnot prohibit client trades from being ported is not sufficient to say they are highly likely to be ported.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.15]  \\n 183. Where a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member and \\nanother client of the clearing member jointly default or become jointly insolvent, but all other \\nconditions in the preceding paragraph are met, a risk weight of 4% will apply to the client’s exposure to the clearing member, or to the higher level client, respe ctively.

The counterparty credit risk requirements arise where assets or collateral \\nof a clearing member or client are posted with a CCP or a clearing member and are not held in a \\nbankruptcy r emote manner.

Where such collateral is included in the definition of trade exposures and the entity \\nholding the collateral is the CCP, the following risk weights apply where the assets or collateral is not hel d on a bankruptcy- remote basis:  \\n(1) For institutions that are clearing members a risk -weight of 2% applies. \\n(2) For institutions that are clients of clearing members: \\na) A 2% risk weight applies if the conditions in paragraph 181 and 182 are met; or  \\nb) A 4% risk weight applied if the conditions in paragraph 183 are met  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.20]  \\n188. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trades exposures, there is no \\ncapital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposures if the col lateral is: (a) held by a \\ncustodian;\\n44 and (b) bankruptcy remote from the CCP. Regarding this paragraph, all forms of \\ncollateral are included, such as: cash, securities, other pledged assets, and excess initial or variation margin, also called overcollater alization, that is held by a custodian, and is bankruptcy \\nremote from the CCP, is not subject to a capital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposure \\n \\n43  Collateral posted must receive the banking book or trading book treatment it would receive if it had not been \\nposted to the CCP. In addition, this collateral is subject to the CCR framework of the Basel rules, regardless of \\nwhether it is in th e banking or trading book. This includes the increase due to haircuts under either the \\nstandardized supervisory haircuts or the own estimates.   \\n44  In this paragraph, the word “custodian” may include a trustee, agent, pledgee, secured creditor or any other  \\nperson that holds property in a way that does not give such person a beneficial interest in such property and will not result in such property being subject to legally -enforceable claims by such persons creditors, or to a court -\\nordered stay of the return of such property, if such person becomes insolvent or bankrupt.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 62\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 62 to such bankruptcy remote custodian (i.e. the related risk weight or EAD is equal to zero). [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 54.21]  \\n189. The relevant risk weight of the CCP will apply to assets or collateral posted by a bank \\nthat do not meet the definition of trade exposures (for example, treating the exposure as a financial institution under the s tandardized a pproach or i nternal r atings -based a pproach to credit \\nrisk).  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.22]  \\n190. Regarding the calculation of the exposure, or EAD, where banks use the SA -CCR to \\ncalculate exposures, collateral posted which is not held in a bankruptcy remote manner must be accounted for in the net independent collateral amount term in accordance with paragraph 110 to 114. For banks using IM M models, the alpha multiplier must be applied to the exposure on \\nposted collateral. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.23]  \\n B. Default fund exposures  \\n 191. Where a default fund is shared between products or types of business with settlement \\nrisk only (e.g., equities and bonds) and products or types of business which give rise to counterparty credit risk (i.e., OTC derivatives, exchange -traded derivatives, SFTs or long \\nsettlement transactions), all of the default fund contributions will receive the risk weigh t \\ndetermined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below, without apportioning to different classes or types of business or products. However, where the default fund contributions from clearing members are segregated by product types and only accessible for specific product types, the capital requirements for those default fund exposures determined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below must be calculated for each specific product giving rise to counterparty credit risk. In case the CCP’s prefunded own resources are shared among \\nproduct types, the CCP will have to allocate those funds to each of the calculations, in proportion to the respective product specific EAD.  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.24]  \\n192. Whenever an institution is required to capitalize for exposures arising from default fund \\ncontributions to a QCCP, clearing member institutions will apply the following approach. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.25]  \\n193. Clearing member institutions will apply a risk weight to their default fund con tributions \\ndetermined according to a risk sensitive formula that considers (i) the size and quality of a qualifying CCP’s financial resources, (ii) the counterparty credit risk exposures of such CCP, and (iii) the application of such financial resources vi a the CCP’s loss bearing waterfall, in the \\ncase of one or more clearing member defaults. The clearing member institution’s risk sensitive \\ncapital requirement for its default fund contribution ( 𝐾𝐾\\n𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖) must be calculated using the \\nformulae and methodology set forth below. This calculation may be performed by a CCP, \\ninstitution, supervisor or other body with access to the required data, as long as the conditions in paragraphs 204 to 206 are met.  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.26]  \\n194. The clearing member bank’s risk- sensitive capital requirement for its defaul t fund \\ncontribution (K\\nCMi) is calculated in two steps:  \\n\\n\\n## Page 63\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 63 1) Calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP due to its counterparty credit \\nrisk exposures to all of its clearing members and their clients.  \\n2) Calculate the capital requirement for the clearing member institution.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.27]  \\nHypothetical Capital Requirement of the CCP  \\n195. The first step in calculating the clearing member institution’s capital requirement for its \\ndefault fund contribution is to calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP (K\\nCCP) due to its count erparty credit risk exposures to all of its clearing members and their \\nclients. K CCP is a hypothetical capital requirement for a CCP, calculated on a consistent basis \\nfor the sole purpose of determining the capitalization of clearing member default fund contributions; it does not represent the actual capital requirements for a CCP which may be \\ndetermine by a CCP and its supervisor. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.28]  \\n196. K\\nCCP is calculated using the following formula  \\n𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃=�𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖×𝑀𝑀𝑅𝑅 ×𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚  𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝐹𝐹\\n𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 \\nwhere  \\n(1) RW is a risk weight of 20%45 \\n(2) Capital ratio means 8%  \\n(3) CM is the clearing member  \\n(4) EAD i is the exposure amount of the CCP to CM ‘i’, including both the CM’s own \\ntransactions and client transactions guaranteed by the CM, and all values of collateral held by the CCP (including the CM’s prefunded default fund contribution) against these transactions, relating to the valuation at the end of the regulatory reporting date before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged.  \\n(5) The sum is over all clearing member accounts.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.29]  \\n197. Where clearing members provide client clearing services, and client transactions and \\ncollateral are held in separate (individual or omnibus) sub- accounts to the clearing member’s \\nproprietary business, each such client sub- account should enter the sum in pa ragraph 196 \\n \\n45  The 20% risk weight is a minimum requirement. As with other parts of the capital adequacy framework, OSFI \\nmay increase the risk weight. An increase in such risk weight would be appropriate if, for example, the clearing \\nmembers in a CCP are not highly rated. Any such increase in risk weight is to be communicated by the affected \\ninstitutions to the person completing this calculation.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 64', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 4, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199783', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 64\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 64 separately, i.e. the member EAD in the formula above is then the sum of the client sub-\\naccount EADs and any house sub-account EAD.

For SFTs, EAD is equal to max(EBRM i – IM i – DF i; 0), where  \\n1) EBRM i denotes the exposure value to clearing member ‘i’ before risk mitigation under \\nChapter 4; where, for the purposes of this calculation, variation margin that has been \\nexchanged (before the margin called on the final margin call of that day) enters into the mark -to-market value of the transactions;  \\n2) IM\\ni is the initial margin collateral posted by the clearing member with the CCP;  \\n \\n46  A MPOR of 10 days must be used to calculate the CCP’s potential future exposure to its clearing members on \\nderivatives transactions  \\n47  For exposures to QCCPs located in jurisdictions where the SA -CCR has not been implemented the EAD may be \\ncomputed using the current exposure method as described Capital requirements for bank exposures to central \\ncounterparties . \\n\\n\\n## Page 65\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 65 3) DF i is the prefunded default fund contribution by the clearing member that will be \\napplied upon such clearing member’s default, either along with or immediately following \\nsuch member’s initial margin, to reduce the CCP loss.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.34]  \\n202.

The second step in calculatingthe clearing member institution’s capital requirement for \\nits default fund contributions (K\\nCMi) is to apply the following formula:  \\n𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖=𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚�𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃×�𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜\\n𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃+𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜�;8% ×2% ×𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜� \\nwhere  \\n• 𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖is the capital requirements on the default contribution of member i;  \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜is the total prefunded default fund contributions from clearing members ; \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃 is the CCP’s pr efunded own resources ( e.g. contributed capital, retained \\nearnings, etc ), which are contributed to the default waterfall, where these are \\njunior or pari pass u to prefunded member  contributions ; and   \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜is the prefunded default fund contributions provided by clearing member i .  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.36]  \\n204.

Transactions settled through a delivery- versus -payment system (DvP) ,48 providing \\nsimultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose firms to a risk of loss on the difference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the transaction valued at \\ncurrent market price (i.e. , positive current exposure). Transactions where cash is paid without \\nreceipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, foreign currencies, gold, or commodities) or, \\nconversely, deliverables were delivered without receipt of the corresponding cash payment (non -\\nDvP, or free -delivery) expose firms to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or \\ndeliverables delivered. The current rules set out specific capital charges that address these two \\nkinds of exposures.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.3 and 70.4]  \\n 213. The following capital treatment is applicable to all transactions on securities, foreign \\nexchange instruments, and commodities that give rise to a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. \\nThis includes transactions through recogni zed clearing houses and central counterparties that are \\nsubject to daily mark -to-market and payment of daily variation margins and that involve a \\nmismatched trade .\\n49 The treatment does not apply to the instruments that are subject to the \\ncounterparty credit risk requirements set out in section 7.1 or the credit risk mitigation section of \\nchapter 4 of this guideline (i.e. over -the-counter derivatives, exchange -traded derivatives, long \\nsettlement transactions, securities financing transa ctions).[ Basel Framework, CRE 70.5]  \\n 214. In cases of a system wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central \\ncounterparty, a national supervisor may use its discretion to waive capital charges until the situation is rectified. [BCBS June 2006 Annex 3 par 4] and [Basel Framework, CRE 70.7]  \\n 215. Failure of a counterparty to settle a trade in itself will not be deemed a default for \\npurposes of credit risk under this guideline.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.8]  \\n 216. In applying a risk weight to failed free -delivery exposures, institutions using the IRB \\napproach for credit risk may assign PDs to counterparties for which they have no other banking book exposure on the basis of the counterparty’s external rating. Institutions using the Advanced IRB approach may use a 45 % LGD in lieu of estimating LGDs so long as they apply it to all \\nfailed trade exposures. Alternatively, institutions using the IRB approach may opt to apply the standardi zed approach risk weights or a 100% risk weight.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.10]  \\n \\n48  For the purpose of this guideline, DvP transactions include payment -versus -payment (PvP) transactions.  \\n49  An expos ure value of zero for counterparty credit risk can be attributed to payment transactions (e.g. funds \\ntransfer transactions) and other spot transactions that are outstanding with a central counterparty (e.g. a clearing \\nhouse), when the central counterparty CCR exposures with all participants in its arrangements are fully \\ncollateraliz ed on a daily basis.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 68\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 68 7.2.2 Capital  requirements  \\n217. For DvP  transactions, if the payments have not yet taken place five business days after \\nthe settlement date, firms must calculate a capital charge by multiplying the positive current \\nexposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor, according to the Table 3. \\n \\n \\nTable 3  \\nNumber of working days after the \\nagreed settlement date  Corresponding risk multiplier  \\nFrom 5 to 15  8% \\nFrom 16 to 30  50% \\nFrom 31 to 45  75% \\n46 or more  100%  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 70.9]  \\n \\n218. For non- DvP transactions (i.e. , free deliveries), after the first contractual \\npayment/delivery leg, the institution that has made the payment will treat its exposure as a loan if the second leg has not been received by the end of the business day.\\n50 This means that an \\ninstitution under the IRB approach will apply the appropriate IRB formula set out in this guideline, for the exposure to the counterparty, in the same way as it does for all other banking \\nbook exposures. Similarly, institutions under the standardi zed approach will use the s tandardi zed \\nrisk weights set forth in this guideline. However, when exposures are not material, institutions \\nmay choose to apply a uniform 100% risk- weight to these exposures, in order to avoid the \\nburden of a full credit assessment. If five business days after the second contractual payment/delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the institution that has \\nmade the first payment leg will deduct from capital the full amount of the value transferred plus \\nreplacement cost, if any. This  treatment will apply until the second payment/delivery leg is \\neffectively made.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.4]  \\n \\n \\n50  If the dates when two payment legs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is \\nmade, it is deemed that they are settled on the same day.

Finance is broadly categorized\\ninto three areas: personal ﬁnance (managing individual or household ﬁnances), corporate\\nﬁnance (managing business ﬁnances), and public ﬁnance (managing government revenues\\nand expenditures). The primary goal of ﬁnance is to maximize value while balancing liq-\\nuidity and proﬁtability.\\nWhat is Risk?\\nRisk refers to the uncertainty or potential for loss in ﬁnancial decisions or investments.\\nIt arises from factors such as market volatility, economic changes, or unforeseen events.\\nIn ﬁnance, risk is often measured by the likelihood and magnitude of deviations from\\nexpected outcomes. Common types of ﬁnancial risk include market risk (price ﬂuctua-\\ntions), credit risk (default on loans), liquidity risk (inability to convert assets to cash),\\nand operational risk (failures in processes or systems).\\nThe Relationship Between Finance and Risk\\nFinance and risk are inherently linked, as ﬁnancial decisions involve weighing potential\\nreturns against uncertainties. Eﬀective ﬁnancial management requires assessing and mit-\\nigating risks through strategies like diversiﬁcation, hedging, or insurance.

We believe that the non-GAAP measures and ratios presented here, read together with our GAAP results, provide readerswith a better understanding of how management assesses results and are a reflection of ongoing business performance.\\nAdjusted results and measures in this section, including earnings per share (EPS), EPS growth, return on equity (ROE), return on tangible common\\nequity (ROTCE), net income, revenue, non-interest expense, efficiency ratio and operating leverage, are non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, an d\\nare discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nInformation regarding the composition of each of these measures is provided in the Glossary of Financial Terms.\\nFinancial Objectives\\nBMO has established medium-term financial objectives for certain important performance measures, which are set out below. Medium-term isgenerally defined as three to five years, and performance is assessed on an adjusted basis. These objectives serve as guideposts and assume anormal business environment and credit cycle. We aim to deliver top-tier total shareholder return and achieve our financial objectives by aligning o ur\\noperations with, and executing on, our strategic priorities.\\nOur business planning process is rigorous, sets ambitious goals and considers factors such as the prevailing economic environment, our risk\\nappetite, customers’ evolving needs and opportunities available across our operating groups. It includes clear and direct accountability for annu al\\nperformance that is measured against both internal and external benchmarks and progress toward our strategic priorities. We seek a balancebetween current profitability and investing to create sustainable growth. Our ability to achieve these objectives may be affected by changes in theeconomic, business or regulatory environment or extraordinary developments.\\nBMO’s results in fiscal 2024 were impacted by higher provisions for credit losses, in part due to a prolonged period of high interest rates, which\\nalso contributed to a more challenging U.S. banking market. Higher credit provisions more than offset our strong expense management. As a result,BMO did not achieve several of its medium-term financial objectives on an adjusted basis. Although an ROE of 15% will be challenging to meet in thenear term, in an environment where credit losses decline from elevated levels, we believe it to be an appropriate medium-term financial objective aswe execute our strategic plan to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our business. BMO has delivered positive operating leverage in four of th e\\nlast five years.

Unless otherwise indicated, all\\namounts are in Canadian dollars and have been derived from our audited annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance withInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. References to GAAP mean IFRS. We usea number of financial measures to assess our performance, as well as the performance of our operating segments, including amounts, measures andratios that are presented on a non-GAAP basis, as described below. We believe that these non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, read togetherwith our GAAP results, provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses results.\\nNon-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP. They are unlikely to be comparable to similar\\nmeasures presented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results.\\nFor further information regarding the composition of other financial measures, including supplementary financial measures, refer to the Glossary\\nof Financial Terms.\\nOur non-GAAP measures broadly fall into the following categories:\\nAdjusted measures and ratios\\nManagement considers both reported and adjusted results and measures to be useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance.\\nAdjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expense, provision for credit losses and income taxes, asdetailed in the following table. Adjusted results and measures presented in this document are non-GAAP. Presenting results on both a reported basisand an adjusted basis permits readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess resultsexcluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. As such, the presentation may facilitate readers’ analysis oftrends. Except as otherwise noted, management’s discussion of changes in reported results in this document applies equally to changes in thecorresponding adjusted results.\\nTangible common equity and return on tangible common equity\\nTangible common equity is calculated as common shareholders’ equity, less goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, net of related defe rred\\ntax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is calculated as net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for the amortizati on\\nof acquisition-related intangible assets, as a percentage of average tangible common equity. ROTCE is commonly used in the North American bankingindustry and is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed organically.\\nMeasures net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities\\nFor periods prior to November 1, 2022, we presented adjusted revenue on a basis net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefitliabilities (CCPB), and our efficiency ratio and operating leverage were calculated on a similar basis.

However, the federal government’s intent tosignificantly reduce immigration and the expected rate of population growth over the next two years implies some downside risk to GDP growth. Theunemployment rate increased by almost one percentage point during the past year to 6.5% in October 2024, due to a rapidly expanding labour forceand slowing employment growth. The unemployment rate is anticipated to rise to 7.0% by early 2025, before falling modestly as economic growthimproves and population growth slows. Easing labour shortages and lower gasoline prices contributed to the moderate 2.0% year-over-year growthin the consumer price index in October 2024. With inflation declining faster than anticipated, the Bank of Canada has lowered its key policy rate by acumulative 125 basis points since June 2024 and is expected to reduce it by an additional 125 basis points to 2.5% by June 2025. The housing marketis projected to strengthen in 2025 as a result of lower mortgage rates and new mortgage rules intended to support first-time home buyers. Industry-wide growth in residential mortgage balances remained stable at 3.5% year-over-year in September 2024, but is projected to gradually pick up ashousing market activity improves in 2025. Year-over-year growth in consumer credit (excluding mortgages) increased to 4.0% in September 2024,amid strong growth in credit card balances, though this is unlikely to be sustained in 2025. Growth in non-financial corporate credit balancesdecelerated sharply in 2024 as a result of weak business investment and elevated cash balances, but is expected to increase at a moderate pacein 2025 in response to lower interest rates. The Canadian dollar will likely remain weak due to the lower interest rate environment in Canada relativeto the United States and the threat of higher tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States, before appreciating modestly in 2025 as the U.S. dollarweakens on an easing Federal Reserve policy.\\nU.S. real GDP growth is estimated to have moderated slightly to an annual rate of 2.7% in 2024 from 2.9% in 2023, amid continued strength in\\nconsumer, business and government spending, partially offset by weaker housing market activity. With support from lower interest rates andexpansionary fiscal policies, including a possible reduction in the corporate tax rate, the economy is projected to continue growing at a healthy rat e\\nof 2.2% in 2025. While employment growth remains solid, the unemployment rate increased from a half-century low of 3.4% in April 2023 to 4.1% inOctober 2024 and is projected to rise slightly to 4.3% in early 2025. The easing in labour market conditions has reduced pressure on inflation,resulting in year-over-year growth in the consumer price index moderating to 2.6% in October 2024. The Federal Reserve lowered its key lending ratefor the first time in four years in September 2024 by 50 basis points and again in November by 25 basis points, and is projected to reduce the ratefurther by a cumulative 125 basis points to a range of 3.25% to 3.50% by late 2025. Growth in residential mortgage balances has slowedconsiderably to 1.9% year-over-year in October 2024 due to ongoing weakness in home sales, but will likely strengthen moderately in 2025 givenanticipated declines in mortgage rates. Despite increased credit card use, year-over-year growth in consumer loan balances decelerated to 1.5% inOctober 2024, but is projected to grow in 2025 due to lower interest rates. Growth in commercial, industrial and commercial real estate creditremains weak due to still elevated borrowing costs, stricter lending conditions and weakness in the office real estate market, though it is expected t o\\nstrengthen in 2025 in response to lower interest rates.\\nThe economic outlook is subject to several risks that could lead to a less favourable outcome for the North American economy. These include\\npotential higher tariffs on U.S. imports, an escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, heightened tensions between the United States an d\\nChina over trade relations and Taiwan, tensions between Canada and India, and a possible strike by U.S. East and Gulf Coast dockworkers inJanuary 2025. In addition, the Canadian dollar faces downside risks from possible U.S. tariffs and the upcoming renegotiation of the Canada-UnitedStates-Mexico Trade Agreement (CUSMA) in 2026.

Net interest income, excluding tradin g, is presented on a basis that excludes trading-related interest incom e.\\nNet Interest Margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, exp ressed as a percentage or in basi s points. Net interest margin,\\nexcluding trading net interest income, and tradi ng and insurance average assets is calculated in th e same manner, excluding trading-related intere st\\nincome, and trading and insurance earning assets.\\nAverage Earning Assets represent the daily average balance of deposits at central b anks, deposits with other banks, securities borrowed or\\npurchased under resale agreements, securities and loans over the period.\\nTrading-Related Revenue comprises net interest income and non-interest revenue ea rned from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions\\nundertaken for trading purposes. We earn revenue from profitably managi ng our positions with clients and, on a limited basis, from our principal\\ntrading positions, subject to prescribed limits. The management of these p ositions typically includes marking them to market on a daily basis. Since\\ntrading activities and related risk management s trategies can periodically shift trading income between net interest income and non-interest inco me,\\nwe view total trading income as the most appropriate measure of trading performance.\\nNet Interest Income\\nReported net interest income was $19,468 million, an increase of $787 million or 4% from the prior year, and adjusted net interest incomewas $18,921 million, a decrease of $173 million or 1% from the prior year.\\nThe increase in reported net interest income primarily reflected the reversal of accrued interest on the fiscal 2022 legal provision in the current\\nyear and the impact of fair value management actions related to Bank of the West in the prior year. Adjusted net interest income decreased, reflectingstrong growth in Canadian P&C driven by higher balances and margins, higher balances in U.S. P&C and an increase in non-trading interest income inBMO Capital Markets, more than offset by lower net interest income in Corporate Services and lower trading-related net interest income. Trading-related net interest income was $169 million, a decrease of $731 million from the prior year, and was largely offset in trading non-interest revenue.\\nBMO’s overall reported net interest margin of 1.57% decreased 6 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted net interest margin, excluding\\ntrading-related net interest income, and trading and insurance assets was 1.85%, a decrease of 3 basis points, primarily due to lower net interestincome and higher low-yielding assets in Corporate Services, partially offset by higher margins in BMO Capital Markets and Canadian P&C.\\nChange in Net Interest Income, Average Earning Assets and Net Interest Margin(1)\\nTABLE 10\\nNet interest margin\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted) Net interest income (2) Average earning assets (3) (in basis points)\\nFor the year ended October 31 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\\nCanadian P&C 8,852 8,043 319,795 296,164 277 272\\nU.S. P&C 8,162 7,607 215,987 195,363 378 389\\nPersonal and Commercial Banking (P&C) 17,014 15,650 535,782 491,527 318 318\\nAll other operating groups and Corporate Services (4) 2,454 3,031 701,463 654,343 na na\\nTotal reported 19,468 18,681 1,237,245 1,145,870 157 163\\nTotal adjusted 18,921 19,094 1,237,245 1,145,870 153 167\\nTrading net interest income, trading and insurance assets 169 900 222,149 180,005 na na\\nTotal reported, excluding trading and insurance 19,299 17,781 1,015,096 965,865 190 184\\nTotal adjusted, excluding trading and insurance 18,752 18,194 1,015,096 965,865 185 188\\nU.S. P&C (US$ in millions) 6,006 5,635 158,919 144,732 378 389\\n(1) Adjusted results and ratios are on a non-GAAP basis and are discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\n(2) Operating group revenue is presented on a taxable equivalent basis (teb) in net interest income.

The reported effective tax rate was 23.2%, compared with 25.4% in\\nthe prior year, primarily due to earnings mix, including the impact of certain Canadian tax measures recorded in fiscal 2023. The adjusted provision f or\\nincome taxes was $2,213 million, compared with $2,517 million in the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.9%, compared with 22.4% inthe prior year.\\nBMO partially hedges, for accounting purposes, the foreign exchange risk arising from investments in foreign operations by funding the\\ninvestments in the corresponding foreign currency. A gain or loss on hedging activities and an unrealized gain or loss on translation of foreignoperations are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. For income tax purposes, a gain or loss on hedging activities results in an incometax charge or credit in the current period that is charged or credited to other comprehensive income, while the associated unrealized gain or loss oninvestments in foreign operations does not incur income taxes until the investments are liquidated. The income tax charge/benefit arising from ahedging gain/loss is a function of the fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period. Hedging of investments in foreign operations has givenrise to an income tax recovery in other comprehensive income of $38 million in the current year, compared with a recovery of $90 million in theprior year.\\nThe provision for income taxes presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income is based on transactions recorded in income, regardless of\\nwhen such transactions are subject to taxation by tax authorities, with the exception of the repatriation of retained earnings from subsidiaries.\\nManagement assesses BMO’s consolidated results and the associated provision for income taxes on a GAAP basis.

Operating segment results include allocations from Corporate Services fortreasury-related revenue, corporate and T&O costs, and capital.\\nBMO employs funds transfer pricing and liquidity transfer pricing between corporate treasury and the operating segments in order to assign cost\\nor credit on assets and liabilities to facilitate effective pricing and business decision-making, and to help assess the profitability performance of each\\nline of business. These practices also capture the cost of holding supplemental liquid assets to meet contingent liquidity requirements, as well asfacilitating the management of interest rate and liquidity risk within our risk appetite framework and regulatory requirements. We review our trans fer\\npricing methodologies at least annually in order to align with our interest rate, liquidity and funding risk management practices, and update these a s\\nappropriate.\\nThe costs of Corporate Units and T&O services are largely allocated to the four operating segments, with any remaining amounts retained in\\nCorporate Services. Certain expenses directly incurred to support a specific operating segment are generally allocated to that operating segment.Other expenses are generally allocated across the operating segments in amounts that are reasonably reflective of the level of support provided toeach operating segment. We review our expense allocation methodologies at least annually, and update these as appropriate.\\nPeriodically, certain lines of business and units within our organizational structure are realigned within an operating segment or transferred\\nbetween operating segments and Corporate Services to support our strategic priorities. Allocations of revenue, expenses, provisions for income ta xes\\nand capital from Corporate Services to the operating groups are updated to better align with these changes.\\nCapital is allocated to the operating segments based on the amount of regulatory capital required to support business activities. Effective\\nfiscal 2024, our capital allocation rate increased to 11.5% of risk-weighted assets, compared with 11.0% in fiscal 2023, in order to reflect an increa se\\nin capital requirements. Unallocated capital is reported in Corporate Services. We review our capital allocation methodologies at least annually, and\\nupdate these as appropriate.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17), and retrospectively applied it to fiscal 2023\\nresults and opening retained earnings as at November 1, 2022. Insurance results are now presented in non-interest revenue under insurance serviceresults and insurance investment results. Insurance service results include insurance revenue, insurance service expenses and reinsurance resul ts.\\nInsurance investment results include net returns on insurance-related assets and the impact of the change in discount rates and financial assumptio ns\\non insurance contract liabilities. As a result of the transition to IFRS 17, we no longer report insurance claims, commissions and changes in policybenefits as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\nUpon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for the measurement of investment properties under IAS 40, Investment\\nProperties (IAS 40), recorded in insurance-related assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet from cost to fair value. This change was applied\\nretrospectively to fiscal 2023 results and opening retained earnings as at November 1, 2022.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 33\\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nThese changes did not have a material impact on regulatory capital ratios. Refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section for further\\ndetails.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for securities transactions from the settlement date to the\\ntrade date. This change was applied retrospectively, as if we had always recorded securities transactions on the trade date. As a result, there was anincrease in other assets and other liabilities due to the earlier recognition of transactions, as well as the reclassification of certain balance she et items.\\nFiscal 2023 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s accounting policy change.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the allocation of certain items from Corporate Services to the operating groups was updated to align with\\nunderlying business activity, including transfer pricing methodologies. Comparative results and ratios have been reclassified to conform with th e\\ncurrent period’s presentation.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, balances and associated revenue, expenses and provisions for credit losses related to our Canadian and\\nU.S. indirect retail auto financing business, previously reported in Personal and Commercial Banking, are reported in Corporate Services, reflect ing the\\nexit and wind-down of this business unit. Fiscal 2023 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s presentation.\\nWe analyze revenue at the consolidated level based on GAAP revenue as reported in the audited annual consolidated financial statements, rather\\nthan on a taxable equivalent basis (teb), which is consistent with our Canadian banking peer group. Like many banks, BMO analyzes revenue on a tebbasis at the operating segment level. Revenue and the provision for income taxes in BMO Capital Markets and U.S. P&C are increased on tax-exemptsecurities to equivalent pre-tax amounts in order to facilitate comparisons of income from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The offset to the segmentteb adjustments is reflected in Corporate Services revenue and provision for (recovery of) income taxes. Beginning January 1, 2024, we treatedcertain Canadian dividends in BMO Capital Markets as non-deductible for tax purposes, due to legislation that was enacted by the Canadiangovernment in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result, we no longer report this revenue on a teb basis.

Net interest income increased $809 million or 10%,\\ndue to higher balances and net interest margins. Non-interest revenue increased $71 million or 3%, primarily due to the inclusion of AIR MILES, highermutual fund distribution fee revenue and card-related revenue, partially offset by lower commercial lending fee revenue. Net interest marginof 2.77% increased 5 basis points from the prior year, due to higher loan margins and deposits growing faster than loans, partially offset by lowerdeposit margins. The impact of the transition of bankers’ acceptances exposures to loans in Commercial Banking resulted in lower non-interestrevenue offset in net interest income, with a modest reduction in the net interest margin.\\nPersonal and Business Banking revenue increased $694 million or 9%, due to higher net interest income and non-interest revenue. Commercial\\nBanking revenue increased $186 million or 6%, due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue.\\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1,659 million, an increase of $750 million from the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired\\nloans was $1,326 million, an increase of $602 million from the prior year, reflecting higher provisions in Personal and Business Banking, driven byunsecured segments of the consumer portfolio, and Commercial Banking. There was a $333 million provision for credit losses on performing loans inthe current year, compared with a $185 million provision in the prior year.\\nNon-interest expense was $5,005 million, an increase of $282 million or 6% from the prior year, reflecting the inclusion of AIR MILES, and higher\\noperating and technology costs, partially offset by severance in the prior year.\\nAverage gross loans and acceptances increased $16.8 billion or 5% from the prior year.

With inflation returning to targete d\\nlevels, the Bank of Canada lowered its key policy rate by a cumulative 125 basis points starting in June 2024, although policy rates remain restrictive .\\nGDP growth slowed slightly compared with the prior year and the unemployment rate increased by almost 1% to 6.5% as at October 2024.\\nThe higher interest rate environment continued to drive steady growth in term deposits for most of fiscal 2024, including ongoing migration from\\nchequing and savings accounts, which began to abate in recent months as interest rates declined and equity markets improved. In response to slowerhousing market activity, mortgage growth moderated from the prior year, but remained healthy, supported by robust population growth and strongcustomer acquisition. Credit card growth remained strong, supported by continued account growth and consumer spending, and higher revolvingbalances. Business lending growth eased, as clients continued to manage their balance sheets in the higher interest rate environment. Credit lossesincreased, with higher consumer delinquencies and insolvencies reflecting rising unemployment, as well as higher impairment rates for businessbanking and commercial clients.\\nThe Canadian economy is expected to expand moderately in 2025 and the Bank of Canada is anticipated to reduce interest rates by an\\nadditional 125 basis points to 2.5% by June 2025. Deposit growth is expected to continue to slow, reflecting a decrease in demand for term depositsas customers seeking higher yielding products migrate to equity markets. Mortgage growth is forecasted to gradually pick up as housing marketactivity improves and new mortgage rules take effect. Credit card growth is expected to ease from current high levels. Business lending is expectedto improve at a moderate pace in 2025 in response to lower interest rates. The lower cost of borrowing is expected to ease pressure on householdand business balance sheets through the year.\\nWe continue to invest in our business with a focus on delivering exceptional customer solutions and advice, together with leading digital\\nexperiences, and execute on our strategy to drive business growth in any environment.\\nThe Canadian economic environment in calendar 2024 and the outlook for calendar 2025 are discussed in more detail in the Economic\\nDevelopments and Outlook section.\\nCautionThis Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking section contains forward-looking statements.

U.S. GDP growth in 2024 moderated slightly from 2023, but remained strong. However, the U.S. banking industryexperienced muted loan demand and continued competition for deposits, reflecting the high interest rate environment, which increased funding cost s\\nand put pressure on net interest margins. Year-over-year growth in overall commercial loan balances decelerated in response to high interest rates,weakness in the commercial real estate market and uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election, while mortgage and home equityloans moderated amid a weaker housing market. Deposit growth improved in the second half of the year, benefitting from good customer acquisitionas a result of investments in marketing and digital capabilities. Provisions for credit losses have increased and were elevated in the second half of t he\\nyear, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates on debt servicing costs, changes in consumer preferences for products and services, and weaknes s\\nin the commercial real estate and transportation sectors.\\nThe U.S. economy is projected to grow at a healthy but more moderate pace in calendar 2025, supported by lower interest rates and\\nexpansionary fiscal policies, including a possible reduction in the corporate tax rate. The Federal Reserve lowered its key lending rate for the firs t time\\nin four years in September 2024 by 50 basis points and will likely continue to reduce rates in 2025. As a result, business and consumer lendingdemand is expected to improve through fiscal 2025 while deposit costs should stabilize. The lower cost of borrowing is expected to ease pressure onhousehold and business balance sheets.\\nLeveraging our diversified Commercial Banking franchise, an expanded Personal and Business Banking franchise and a national digital deposit\\nplatform, we are well-positioned to drive profitable growth and customer loyalty. We will remain focused on driving efficiencies by simplifying andstreamlining operations and investing in digital capabilities.\\nThe U.S. economic environment in calendar 2024 and the outlook for calendar 2025 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Developments\\nand Outlook section.\\nCautionThis U.S. Personal and Commercial Banking section contains forward-looking statements.

IFRS 17\\nprovides a comprehensive approach to accounting for all types of insurance contracts and replaced IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts. Insurance results are\\nnow presented in non-interest revenue under insurance service results and insurance investment results. As a result of the adoption and retrospecti ve\\napplication of IFRS 17 to our fiscal 2023 results, we no longer report insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities. For fu rther\\ndetails, refer to Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nReported net income was $1,248 million, an increase of $102 million or 9% from the prior year. Wealth and Asset Management reported net income\\nwas $1,012 million, an increase of $188 million or 23%, and included one additional quarter of Bank of the West results, compared with the prioryear. Insurance net income was $236 million, a decrease of $86 million or 27%.\\nTotal revenue was $5,646 million, an increase of $235 million or 4%. Revenue in Wealth and Asset Management was $5,279 million, an increase\\nof $349 million or 7%, due to growth in client assets, including the impact of stronger global markets, and higher revenue from online brokeragetransactions, partially offset by lower net interest income due to lower margins. Insurance revenue was $367 million, a decrease of $114 million,reflecting changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS 17.\\nThe total provision for credit losses was $31 million, compared with an $18 million provision in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on\\nimpaired loans increased $21 million and the provision for credit losses on performing loans decreased $8 million.\\nNon-interest expense was $3,968 million, an increase of $90 million or 2% from the prior year, due to higher revenue-based costs and our\\ninvestment in talent, partially offset by operational efficiencies.\\nAssets under management increased $89.8 billion or 27% from the prior year to $422.7 billion, driven by stronger global markets and higher net\\nclient assets. Assets under administration decreased $55.1 billion or 13% to $361.2 billion, primarily due to the exit of our Institutional Trust Ser vices\\noperations in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by stronger global markets. Average gross loans increased 5% and average deposits we re\\nrelatively unchanged from the prior year.\\nFor further information on non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios in this 2024 Operating Groups Performance Review section, refer to the\\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\\nBMO Wealth Management results benefitted from growing momentum in equity markets through fiscal 2024, with a moderation of inflationarypressures and declining interest rates in the second half of the year. Higher assets under management from stronger global markets and net newasset flows supported revenue growth, offsetting the industry-wide reduction in asset yields and lower net interest margins from deposit migrationto higher yielding assets.

All periodsincluded acquisition and integration costs, as well as the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which increased in fiscal 2023, due to\\nthe acquisition of Bank of the West.\\nFinancial performance benefitted from the strength and diversification of our businesses. Results were impacted by a higher interest rate\\nenvironment and uncertain economic conditions resulting in higher credit provisions, slower loan demand and lower levels of client activity in ourmarket-sensitive businesses.\\nRevenue growth in Canadian P&C reflected good customer acquisition and volume growth and higher net interest margins. U.S. P&C revenue\\nperformance benefitted from the inclusion of Bank of the West; however, recent quarters have been impacted by a more muted U.S. bankingenvironment, with reduced loan demand and higher deposit costs. Revenue in BMO Wealth Management benefitted from steady growth in clientassets, including the impact of improved global markets in fiscal 2024, while high interest rates resulted in a shift in deposit mix to term deposits an d\\nreduced margins. Insurance revenue is subject to variability resulting from market-related impacts, including changes in portfolio positioning d uring\\nthe transition to IFRS 17.

Adjusted results excluded the specified items noted in the Summary Quarterly Earnings Trends section.\\nReported net income increased from the prior year, primarily due to the reversal of the fiscal 2022 legal provision, including accrued interest, and\\nlower acquisition and integration costs, compared with the prior year. The decrease in adjusted net income reflected a higher provision for creditlosses, partially offset by lower expenses, with revenue relatively unchanged from the prior year. Reported and adjusted net income decreased acros s\\nall operating segments. Corporate Services recorded net income on a reported basis, compared with a net loss in the prior year, and a lower net losson an adjusted basis.\\nRevenue\\nReported revenue was $8,957 million, an increase of $638 million or 8% from the prior year, due to the reversal of accrued interest on the legalprovision in the current year. Adjusted revenue was $8,368 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year, with higher non-interest revenuepartially offset by lower net interest income. Adjusted net interest income decreased, primarily due to lower trading-related net interest income a nd\\nlower net interest income in Corporate Services due to lower net accretion of purchase accounting fair value marks, partially offset by higher netinterest income in Canadian P&C due to higher balances and higher non-trading interest income in BMO Capital Markets. Non-interest revenueincreased, primarily driven by higher trading revenue, investment management and custodial fee revenue and mutual fund fee revenue, partiallyoffset by lower insurance-related revenue reflecting changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS 17, the impact of mark-downs onthe held-for-sale loan portfolio and lower lending fee revenue, largely offset in net interest income reflecting the transition of bankers’ accepta nces\\nexposures to loans, and lower card fee revenue.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 53\\n\\n\\n## Page 42', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 4, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667285', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 42\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nProvision for Credit Losses\\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1,523 million, compared with a provision of $446 million in the prior year. Total provision for credit losses as a\\npercentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 91 basis points, compared with 27 basis points in the prior year. The provision for creditlosses on impaired loans was $1,107 million, an increase of $699 million, due to higher provisions across operating segments, primarily in the U.S.corporate and commercial portfolio, and in the Canadian unsecured segments of the consumer portfolio. The provision for credit losses on impairedloans as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 66 basis points, compared with 25 basis points in the prior year. There wasa $416 million provision for credit losses on performing loans, compared with a $38 million provision in the prior year, primarily driven by portfoliocredit migration, as well as uncertainty in credit conditions.\\nNon-Interest Expense\\nReported non-interest expense was $4,427 million, a decrease of $1,252 million or 22% from the prior year, and adjusted non-interest expensewas $4,876 million, a decrease of $100 million or 2%. Reported results reflected the reversal of the legal provision and the impact of loweracquisition and integration costs in the current year. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased, primarily due to our continued focus on operationa l\\nefficiencies, including realized cost synergies related to Bank of the West, and lower premises costs, including the charge in the prior year related to\\nthe consolidation of BMO real estate, and other operating costs.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThe reported provision for income taxes was $703 million, an increase of $219 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and the adjustedprovision for income taxes was $427 million, a decrease of $241 million. The reported effective tax rate was 23.4%, compared with 22.1% in thefourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7%, compared with 22.9%. The change in the reported effective tax raterelative to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the impact of higher income in the current year, and the change in the adjusted effectivetax rate was primarily due to earnings mix, including the impact of lower income in the current quarter.\\nQ4 2024 vs. Q3 2024\\nReported net income increased $439 million or 24% from the prior quarter, and adjusted net income decreased $439 million or 22%. Reported netincome increased primarily due to the reversal of the legal provision. The decrease in adjusted net income reflected a higher provision for creditlosses and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenue. Reported and adjusted net income decreased across all operating segments. Corporat e\\nServices recorded net income on a reported basis, compared with a net loss in the prior quarter, and a lower net loss on an adjusted basis. Reportedrevenue increased $765 million or 9% from the prior quarter, and adjusted revenue increased $162 million or 2%. Reported revenue reflected highernet interest income, primarily driven by the reversal of accrued interest on the legal provision. Reported and adjusted revenue reflected higher netinterest income, driven by higher Corporate Services and Canadian P&C net interest income, as well as higher non-trading interest income in BMOCapital Markets, partially offset by lower trading-related net interest income, and higher non-interest revenue, driven by higher trading revenue and\\nunderwriting and advisory fee revenue, partially offset by lower card and lending fee revenue. Reported non-interest expense decreased $412 millio n\\nor 9% from the prior quarter, due to the reversal of the legal provision, and adjusted non-interest expense increased $179 million or 4%, primarilydue to higher professional fees and higher association, clearing and annual regulator fees. Total provision for credit losses increased $617 millio n\\nfrom the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans increased $279 million, due to higher provisions in the corporate andcommercial portfolio.

In addition, we completed the acquisition of the AIR MILES Reward Program (AIR MILES) on June 1, 2023, which contributed to theincrease in revenue and expenses in our Canadian P&C business beginning the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\\nPrior to November 1, 2022, we presented revenue on a basis net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities\\n(CCPB). Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we no longer report CCPB, given the adoption and retrospective application of IFRS 17, Insurance\\nContracts (IFRS 17).

The decrease in reported results primarily reflected actions to manage the impact of interest ratechanges between the announcement and closing of the Bank of the West acquisition on its fair value and goodwill which resulted in a net loss infiscal 2023, compared with a net gain in fiscal 2022, and the impact of a lawsuit associated with a predecessor bank, M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank, infiscal 2022, partially offset by higher acquisition and integration costs, an initial provision for credit losses on the purchased Bank of the West lo an\\nportfolio, as well as higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to the Bank of the West acquisition in fiscal 2023, and th e\\nimpact of certain tax measures enacted by the Canadian government.\\nAdjusted net income decreased, as the inclusion of Bank of the West and higher underlying revenue were more than offset by higher expenses\\nand a higher provision for credit losses. Reported and adjusted net income increased in U.S. P&C and decreased in BMO Wealth Management,Canadian P&C and BMO Capital Markets. On a reported basis, Corporate Services recorded a net loss in fiscal 2023, compared with net income infiscal 2022, primarily due to the items noted above. On an adjusted basis, Corporate Services recorded a higher net loss.\\nRevenue\\nReported revenue in fiscal 2023 was $29,259 million, a decrease of $4,451 million or 13% from fiscal 2022, primarily due to the impact of fair valuemanagement actions and interest expense related to the legal provision, as noted above. On an adjusted basis, and net of insurance claims,commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB) in fiscal 2022, revenue increased $4,905 million, due to the inclusion of Bank of the Wes t\\nand AIR MILES, as well as higher revenue in Canadian P&C and BMO Capital Markets.\\nProvision for Credit Losses\\nThe total provision for credit losses (PCL) in fiscal 2023 was $2,178 million on a reported basis and $1,473 million on an adjusted basis, comparedwith $313 million on both a reported and an adjusted basis in fiscal 2022. PCL on impaired loans was $1,180 million in fiscal 2023, an increaseof $678 million from fiscal 2022, with higher provisions across all businesses. PCL on performing loans in fiscal 2023 was $998 million on a reportedbasis, including the initial provision of $705 million on the purchased Bank of the West performing loan portfolio, and $293 million on an adjustedbasis, compared with a reported and an adjusted recovery of credit losses of $189 million in fiscal 2022.\\nNon-Interest Expense\\nReported non-interest expense in fiscal 2023 was $21,134 million, an increase of $4,940 million or 31% from fiscal 2022, and adjusted non-interestexpense was $18,713 million, an increase of $3,519 million or 23% from fiscal 2022. Reported non-interest expense in fiscal 2023 included higheracquisition and integration costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, compared with fiscal 2022, partially offset by the l ower\\nlegal expense related to the lawsuit associated with M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank. Reported and adjusted non-interest expense increased, primarilydue to the inclusion of Bank of the West, as well as higher employee-related, technology, advertising and business development costs, and legalprovisions in fiscal 2023.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThe provision for income taxes in fiscal 2023 was $1,510 million, compared with $4,349 million in fiscal 2022. The reported effective tax rate infiscal 2023 was 25.4%, compared with 24.3% in fiscal 2022, with the increase primarily due to the impact of certain Canadian tax measures duringthe 2023 fiscal year. The adjusted provision for income taxes in fiscal 2023 was $2,517 million, compared with $2,670 million in fiscal 2022. Theadjusted effective tax rate was 22.4% in fiscal 2023, compared with 22.8% in fiscal 2022.\\n56BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 45\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Financial Condition Review\\nSummary Balance Sheet\\nTABLE 24\\n(Canadian $ in millions)\\nAs at October 31 2024 2023\\nAssets\\nCash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits with banks 68,738 82,043\\nSecurities 396,880 320,084\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements 110,907 115,662\\nNet loans 678,016 656,665\\nDerivative instruments 47,253 39,976\\nOther assets 107,853 132,576\\nTotal assets 1,409,647 1,347,006\\nLiabilities and Equity\\nDeposits 982,440 910,879\\nDerivative instruments 58,303 50,193\\nSecurities lent or sold under repurchase agreements 110,791 106,108\\nOther liabilities 165,450 195,475\\nSubordinated debt 8,377 8,228\\nEquity 84,250 76,095\\nNon-controlling interest in subsidiaries 36 28\\nTotal liabilities and equity 1,409,647 1,347,006\\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified for changes in accounting policy.\\nOverview\\nTotal assets of $1,409.6 billion increased $62.6 billion from October 31, 2023.

Details on our enterprise-wide capital management practices and strategies can be found below.\\nEnterprise-Wide Capital Management\\nCapital Management\\nObjective\\nBMO is committed to a disciplined approach to capital management that balances the interests and requirements of our shareholders, regulators,depositors, fixed income investors and rating agencies. We recognize the global trend of rising regulatory capital requirements, and manage ourcapital position accordingly. Our objective is to maintain a strong and optimized capital position in a cost-effective structure that:\\n‰Is appropriate given BMO’s target regulatory capital ratios and internal assessment of economic capital requirements\\n‰Underpins BMO’s operating groups’ business strategies and considers the market environment\\n‰Supports depositor, investor and regulator confidence, and dividends, while building long-term shareholder value\\n‰Is consistent with BMO’s target credit ratings.\\nFramework\\nCapital Supply\\nCapital available\\nto support risksCapital Demand\\nCapital required to support\\nthe risks underlying our\\nbusiness activitiesCapital adequacy\\nassessment of capital\\ndemand and supply\\nThe principles and key elements of our capital management framework are outlined in our Capital Management Corporate Policy and in the annual\\ncapital plan, which includes the results of the comprehensive Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\\nICAAP is an integrated process that involves the application of stress testing and other tools to assess capital adequacy on both a regulatory and\\nan economic basis. The results of this process inform and support the establishment of capital targets and the implementation of capital strategiesthat take into consideration the strategic direction and risk appetite of the enterprise. The annual capital plan is developed considering the resul ts of\\nICAAP and in conjunction with the annual business plan, promoting alignment between business and risk strategies, regulatory and economic capitalrequirements and the availability of capital. Enterprise-wide stress testing and scenario analysis are conducted in order to assess the impact of va rious\\nstress conditions on our risk profile and capital requirements.\\nOur capital management framework seeks to ensure that the bank is adequately capitalized given the risks we assume in the normal course of\\nbusiness, as well as under stress, and supports the determination of limits, targets and performance measures that are applied in managing balancesheet positions, risk levels and capital requirements at the consolidated entity, legal entity and operating group levels. We seek to optimize ourcapital through efficient use of our balance sheet and the related risks we undertake, and may employ levers such as risk transfer transactions andthe sale of assets. We evaluate assessments of actual and forecasted capital adequacy against our capital targets throughout the year, includingconsideration of changes in our business activities and risk profile, the operating environment, our competitors, and current and future regulator y\\nexpectations.\\nWe allocate capital to operating groups in order to evaluate business performance, and we consider capital implications in our strategic, tactical\\nand transactional decision-making. By allocating capital to operating groups, setting and monitoring capital limits and metrics, and measuring th e\\ngroups’ performance against these limits and metrics, we seek to optimize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, while maintaining awell-capitalized position.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 59\\n\\n\\n## Page 48\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nThis approach is intended to protect interested parties from the risks inherent in our various businesses, while still providing the flexibility to\\ndeploy resources in support of strategic growth activities and to maintain dividends.\\nRefer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section for further discussion of the risks underlying our business.\\nGovernance\\nThe Board of Directors, either directly or through its Risk Review Committee, provides ultimate oversight and approval of capital management,including the bank’s Capital Management Corporate Policy, capital plan and capital adequacy assessments. The Board of Directors regularly reviewsthe bank’s capital position and key capital management activities. In addition, the capital adequacy assessment results determined by ICAAP areapproved by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Risk Review Committee. The Enterprise Capital Management Committee providessenior management oversight, including the review of significant capital management policies, issues and activities, and the capital required tosupport the execution of our enterprise-wide strategy. Finance and Risk Management are responsible for the design and implementation of ourcorporate policies and frameworks related to capital and risk management, as well as ICAAP. The Corporate Audit Division, as the third line ofdefence, verifies adherence to controls and identifies opportunities to strengthen our processes. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk ManagementFramework section for further discussion.\\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\\nRegulatory capital requirements for BMO are determined in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI, which are based on the Basel III frameworkdeveloped by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The current minimum risk-based capital ratios set out in OSFI’s Capital AdequacyRequirements (CAR) Guideline are a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 6.0% and a Total Capital Ratio of 8.0%. Inaddition to these minimum capital requirements, OSFI also requires domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), including BMO, to hold Pillar 1and Pillar 2 buffers, which are meant to be used as a normal first response in periods of stress. Pillar 1 buffers include a capital conservation bufferof 2.5%, a D-SIB Common Equity Tier 1 surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer, which can range from 0% to 2.5%, depending on a bank’sexposure to jurisdictions that have activated the buffer. If a bank’s capital ratios fall below the range of the combined minimum and Pillar 1 buffers,restrictions on discretionary distributions of earnings (such as dividends, share repurchases and discretionary compensation) could ensue, with the\\ndegree of such restrictions varying according to the position of the bank’s ratios. Pillar 2 buffers address risks associated with systemic vulnerab ilities\\nand include the domestic stability buffer (DSB), which can range from 0% to 4.0% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and was 3.5% as atOctober 31, 2024. The buffer level is set twice a year by OSFI, in June and December, but OSFI can make a change at any time when needed. UnderOSFI guidelines, breaches of the DSB do not automatically result in constraints on capital distributions. In the event of a breach, OSFI would require a\\nremediation plan and would expect the plan to be executed in a timely manner. Banks may be required to hold additional regulatory buffers that areapplicable to the capital ratios, the Leverage and the Total Loss Absorbing Capital (TLAC) Ratios.\\nTLAC comprises the aggregate of Total Capital and Other TLAC instruments that allow conversion, in whole or in part, into common shares under\\ntheCanada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act and meet the eligibility criteria under the TLAC Guideline.

Canada\\nDeposit Insurance Corporation has the power to trigger the conversion of bail-in debt into common shares. This statutory conversion supplementsNVCC securities, which must be converted in full prior to the conversion of bail-in debt.\\nRisk-Weighted Assets\\nRisk-weighted assets (RWA) measure a bank’s exposures, weighted for their relative risk and calculated in accordance with the regulatory capitalrules prescribed by OSFI, which include standardized and internal ratings or internal model approaches for credit and market risk, and standardizedapproaches for operational risk.\\nWe primarily use the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach to determine credit RWA in our portfolio. The IRB Approach includes the Foundation\\n(FIRB) Approach for exposures to financial institutions and large corporate portfolios, and the Advanced (AIRB) Approach for all other exposures. T he\\nAIRB Approach applies sophisticated techniques to measure RWA at the exposure level based on sound risk management principles, includingestimates of the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) risk parameters, as well as term to maturity and\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 61\\n\\n\\n## Page 50', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 5, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667300', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 50\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nasset class type, as prescribed by the OSFI rules. These risk parameters are determined using internal models that leverage historical portfolio dat a\\nsupplemented by benchmarking, as appropriate, and are updated periodically. Validation procedures related to these models are in place in order toquantify and differentiate risks appropriately. The FIRB Approach employs the same internal PD estimates as the AIRB Approach, but LGD and EADparameters are prescribed by OSFI. Credit risk RWA related to certain Canadian and U.S. portfolios are determined under the Standardized Approachusing prescribed risk weights based on external ratings, counterparty type or product type. These portfolios reflect current waivers and exemption st o\\nthe IRB Approach approved by OSFI. For further discussion of these respective approaches noted above, refer to the Credit and Counterparty Risk –Credit and Counterparty Risk Measurement section.\\nWe use the Standardized Approach for determining market risk and operational risk capital requirements.In calculating regulatory capital ratios, total RWA must be increased when the capital floor amount calculated under the standardized approaches,\\nmultiplied by a capital floor adjustment factor, is higher than a similar calculation using the more risk-sensitive internal modelled approaches, w here\\napplicable. Other than during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the capital floor was not operative for BMO in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\\nRegulatory Capital Developments\\nThe revised CAR Guideline, published by OSFI in October 2023, was effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and includes heightened regulatorycapital requirements for mortgages with growing balances where payments are insufficient to cover the interest component, as well as otherchanges that provide further clarification on the application of the guideline.\\nEffective November 1, 2023, the DSB was raised from 3.0% to 3.5% of total RWA.The domestic implementation of the Basel III Reforms related to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, along with an increase in the\\ncapital floor adjustment from 65.0% to 67.5%, became effective the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On July 5, 2024, OSFI announced a one-year delay inthe next increase of the capital floor adjustment factor to allow OSFI time to consider the impact of the implementation of Basel III reforms in otherjurisdictions. With the one-year delay, the adjustment factor will remain at the current 67.5% for fiscal 2025 and will then rise by an additional 2.5%to 70.0% in fiscal 2026 and 72.5% in fiscal 2027.\\nThe Parental Stand-Alone (Solo) TLAC Framework for D-SIBs, published by OSFI on September 12, 2023, was effective in the first quarter of\\nfiscal 2024. The purpose of the Solo framework is to ensure a non-viable D-SIB has sufficient loss absorbing capacity on a stand-alone legal entitybasis to support its resolution, which would, in turn, facilitate an orderly resolution of the D-SIB while minimizing adverse impacts on the stabilit yo f\\nthe financial sector, ensuring the continuity of critical functions and minimizing taxpayers’ exposure to loss. We exceeded the minimum Solo TLACrequirement of 21.5%.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17). Upon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily\\nchanged our accounting policy for the measurement of investment properties under IAS 40, Investment Properties (IAS 40), recorded in insurance-\\nrelated assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, from cost value to fair value. This change did not have a material impact on regulatory capitalratios. Refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section for further details.\\nRegulatory Capital and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity Review\\nBMO is well-capitalized, with capital ratios that exceed OSFI’s published requirements for large Canadian banks, including a DSB of 3.5%. OurCET1 Ratio was 13.6% as at October 31, 2024, compared with 12.5% as at October 31, 2023. Our CET1 Ratio increased from the prior year, primarily asa result of internal capital generation, common shares issued under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (DRIP) andlower source-currency RWA. There was a positive impact to the ratio from the reversal of a fiscal 2022 legal provision associated with a predecessorbank, M&I Marshal and Ilsley Bank, which increased internal capital generation and reduced RWA.\\nOur Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital Ratios were 15.4% and 17.6%, respectively, as at October 31, 2024, compared with 14.1% and 16.2%,\\nrespectively, as at October 31, 2023. The Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital Ratios were higher, due to the same factors impacting the CET1 Ratio, as wellas the issuances of Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCN) totalling US$1.75 billion, partially offset by preferred share redemptions.\\nThe impact of foreign exchange movements on BMO’s capital ratios was largely offset. BMO’s investments in foreign operations are primarily\\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and the foreign exchange impact of U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA and capital deductions may result in variability in thebank’s capital ratios. We manage the impact of foreign exchange movements on RWA and capital deductions in our capital ratios.\\nOur Leverage Ratio was 4.4% as at October 31, 2024, an increase from 4.2% as at October 31, 2023, driven by higher Tier 1 Capital, partially\\noffset by higher leverage exposures.\\nAs at October 31, 2024, our TLAC Ratio was 29.3% and our TLAC Leverage Ratio was 8.3%, compared with 27.0% and 8.1%, respectively, as at\\nOctober 31, 2023.\\nWhile the ratios discussed above reflect our consolidated capital base, we conduct business through a variety of corporate structures, including\\nsubsidiaries. A framework is in place such that capital and funding are managed appropriately at the subsidiary level.\\nFollowing the acquisition of Bank of the West in fiscal 2023, our U.S. bank intermediate holding company BMO Financial Corp. (BFC) became a\\nCategory III institution under the Enhanced Prudential Standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). BFC is required to meet certainheightened regulatory standards related to capital, liquidity and risk management, including complying with FRB single counterparty credit limit s. BFC\\nis also subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST) requirements of the FRB on an\\nannual basis.\\nOn June 26, 2024, the FRB released its 2024 CCAR and DFAST results, and on August 28, 2024 announced individual large bank capital\\nrequirements, which were effective October 1, 2024. For BFC, the FRB determined a CET1 Ratio requirement of 10.0%, including the 4.5% minimumCET1 Ratio and a 5.5% stress capital buffer. BFC is well-capitalized, with a CET1 Ratio of 11.8% as at September 30, 2024.\\n62BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 51\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Regulatory Capital and TLAC(1)\\nTABLE 30\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted)\\nAs at October 31 2024 2023\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital: Instruments and Reserves\\nDirectly issued qualifying common share capital plus related stock surplus 24,275 23,269\\nRetained earnings 46,469 44,920\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (and other reserves) 5,419 1,862\\nGoodwill and other intangibles (net of related tax liability) (20,349) (20,899)\\nOther common equity Tier 1 capital deductions 1,240 3,762\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) 57,054 52,914\\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital: Instruments\\nDirectly issued qualifying Additional Tier 1 instruments plus related stock surplus 7,787 6,958\\nTotal regulatory adjustments applied to Additional Tier 1 Capital (106) (87)\\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital (AT1) 7,681 6,871\\nTier 1 Capital (T1 = CET1 + AT1) 64,735 59,785\\nTier 2 Capital: Instruments and Provisions\\nDirectly issued qualifying Tier 2 instruments plus related stock surplus 8,230 8,082\\nGeneral allowance 954 902\\nTotal regulatory adjustments to Tier 2 Capital (8) (51)\\nTier 2 Capital (T2) 9,176 8,933\\nTotal Capital (TC = T1 + T2) 73,911 68,718\\nNon-Regulatory Capital Elements of TLAC\\nDirectly issued qualifying Other TLAC instruments 49,465 45,773\\nTotal regulatory adjustments applied to Other TLAC (88) (89)\\nOther TLAC 49,377 45,684\\nTLAC (TLAC = TC + Other TLAC) 123,288 114,402\\nRisk-Weighted Assets and Leverage Ratio Exposures\\nRisk-Weighted Assets 420,838 424,197\\nLeverage Ratio Exposures 1,484,962 1,413,036\\nCapital Ratios (%)\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio 13.6 12.5\\nTier 1 Capital Ratio 15.4 14.1\\nTotal Capital Ratio 17.6 16.2\\nTLAC Ratio 29.3 27.0\\nLeverage Ratio 4.4 4.2\\nTLAC Leverage Ratio 8.3 8.1\\n(1) Calculated in accordance with OSFI’s CAR Guideline and LR Guideline, as applicable.

Based on a floor price of $5.00, these NVCC instruments would be converted intoapproximately 4.2 billion BMO common shares, assuming no accrued interest and no declared and unpaid dividends.\\nFurther details on subordinated debt and share capital are provided in Notes 16 and 17 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nDividends\\nDividends per common share declared in fiscal 2024 totalled $6.12, an increase of 6% from the prior year. Annual dividends declaredrepresented 64% of reported net income and 63% of adjusted net income available to common shareholders on a last twelve-month basis.\\nOur target dividend payout range (common share dividends as a percentage of net income available to shareholders, less preferred share\\ndividends and distributions on other equity instruments, based on earnings over the last twelve months) is 40% to 50%, providing shareholders witha competitive dividend yield. Our target dividend payout range seeks to provide shareholders with stable income, while retaining sufficient earnin gs\\nto support anticipated business growth, fund strategic investments and support capital adequacy.\\nAt year-end, our common shares provided an annualized dividend yield of 5% based on the year-end closing share price. On December 5, 2024,\\nwe announced that the Board of Directors had declared a quarterly dividend on common shares of $1.59 per share, an increase of $0.04 per sharefrom the prior quarter and 5% from the prior year. The dividend is payable on February 26, 2025 to shareholders of record on January 30, 2025.\\nShareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan\\nCommon shareholders may elect to have their cash dividends reinvested in common shares of BMO, in accordance with the DRIP.\\nIn the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024, common shares to supply the DRIP were issued from treasury at a 2% discount, calculated in\\naccordance with the terms of the DRIP. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, and until further notice, common shares to supply the DRIP will bepurchased on the open market without a discount. During fiscal 2023, common shares to supply the DRIP were issued from treasury at a 2% discount,calculated in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.\\nEligible Dividends Designation\\nFor the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any similar provincial and territorial legislation, BMO designates all dividends paid or deemed to\\nbe paid on both its common and preferred shares as “eligible dividends”, unless indicated otherwise.\\nCautionThis Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Sta tements.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nWe enter into a number of off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations, and these include structured entities (SEs), credit\\ninstruments and guarantees.\\nStructured Entities and Securitization\\nWe carry out certain business activities through arrangements involving SEs, using them to obtain sources of liquidity and manage capital bysecuritizing certain of our financial assets, to secure customer transactions, or to pass our credit risk exposure to holders of the vehicles’ securi ties. For\\nexample, we enter into transactions with SEs in which we transfer assets, including mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans,real estate lines of credit, auto loans and equipment loans, in order to obtain alternate sources of funding or as part of our trading activities. Note 6 of\\nthe audited annual consolidated financial statements describes the loan securitization activities carried out through third-party programs such as the\\nCanada Mortgage Bond Program and the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities Program. Note 7 of the audited annual consolidatedfinancial statements provides further details of our interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs. Under IFRS, we consolidate a SE if wecontrol the entity. We consolidate our own securitization vehicles, certain capital and funding vehicles, and other structured entities created to meet\\nour customers’ needs, as well as our own. We do not consolidate our customer securitization vehicles, certain capital vehicles, various BMO-managedfunds or various other SEs where investments are held. Further details on our customer securitization vehicles are provided below.\\nBMO-Sponsored Securitization Vehicles\\nWe sponsor various vehicles that fund assets originated either by us (which are then securitized through a bank securitization vehicle) or by ourcustomers (which are then securitized through three Canadian customer securitization vehicles and one U.S. customer securitization vehicle). We e arn\\nfees for providing services related to these customer securitization vehicles, including liquidity, distribution and financial arrangement fees for\\nsupporting the ongoing operations of the vehicles. These fees totalled approximately $160 million in fiscal 2024 ($149 million in fiscal 2023).\\nCustomer Securitization Vehicles\\nOur customer securitization vehicles provide customers with access to financing either from us or from the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP)markets. Customers sell either their assets or an interest in their assets into these vehicles, which then issue ABCP either to investors or to us, inorder to fund the purchases. The sellers remain responsible for servicing the transferred assets and are first to absorb any losses realized on thoseassets. We are not responsible for servicing or absorbing the first loss and none of the sellers are affiliated with BMO.\\nOur exposure to potential losses arises from the purchase of ABCP issued by the vehicles, any related derivative contracts entered into with the\\nvehicles, and the liquidity support provided to the market-funded vehicles. We use the credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enter intothese arrangements, just as we do when extending credit in the form of a loan.\\n66BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 55\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Three of these customer securitization vehicles are market-funded, while the fourth is funded directly by the bank. We do not control these\\nentities and therefore they are not consolidated. Further information on the consolidation of customer securitization vehicles is provided in Note 7o f\\nthe audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe market-funded vehicles had a total of $11.2 billion of ABCP outstanding as at October 31, 2024 ($12.2 billion as at October 31, 2023). The\\nABCP issued by the Canadian market-funded vehicles is rated R-1 (high) by DBRS and P1 by Moody’s, and the ABCP issued by the U.S. market-fundedvehicle is rated A1 by S&P and P1 by Moody’s. Our holdings of ABCP, as distributing agent of ABCP issued by the market-funded vehicles,totalled $170 million as at October 31, 2024 ($518 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nWe provide liquidity facilities to the market-funded vehicles, which may require that we provide additional financing to the vehicles should\\ncertain events occur. The total committed and undrawn amount under these liquidity facilities and the undrawn amount of the BMO funded vehiclesas at October 31, 2024 totalled $19.3 billion ($19.8 billion as at October 31, 2023). This amount comprises part of the commitments outlined inNote 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe assets of each of these market-funded vehicles consist primarily of exposures to diversified pools of automobile-related receivables and\\nconventional residential mortgages in Canada, and automobile-related receivables and equipment loans in the United States. These two asset classe s\\nrepresent 67% (63% in fiscal 2023) in Canada, and 86% (unchanged from 2023) in the United States, of the aggregate assets of their respectivevehicles as at October 31, 2024, and as at October 31, 2023, respectively.\\nGuarantees and Other Credit Instruments\\nTo meet the financial needs of our clients, we use a variety of guarantees and commitments. Guarantees include contracts under which we may berequired to make payments to a counterparty based on changes in the value of an asset, liability or equity security that the counterparty holds.Contracts under which we may be required to make payments if a third party does not perform according to the terms of a contract, and contractsunder which we provide indirect guarantees of indebtedness, are also considered guarantees. In the normal course of business, the types ofguarantee products we offer include letters of credit, derivatives contracts or instruments (including, but not limited to, credit default swaps), as well\\nas indemnification agreements. The maximum amount payable by BMO in relation to these guarantees was $47 billion as at October 31, 2024($40 billion as at October 31, 2023).\\nOther credit commitments are off-balance sheet arrangements that represent our commitment to customers to grant them credit in the form of\\nloans or other financings for specific amounts and maturities, subject to certain conditions. These include backstop liquidity facilities, docume ntary and\\ncommercial letters of credit, and commitments to extend credit. The maximum amount payable by BMO in relation to these other creditcommitments was $261 billion as at October 31, 2024 ($249 billion as at October 31, 2023).\\nThere is a large number of credit instruments outstanding at any time. The amount above is not representative of our likely credit exposure or\\nthe liquidity requirements for these instruments, as it does not take into account customer behaviour, which suggests that only a portion of ourcustomers would utilize the facilities related to these instruments, nor does it take into account any amounts that could be recovered under recourseand collateral provisions. Our customers are broadly diversified, and we do not anticipate events or conditions that would cause a significant numbe r\\nof customers to fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We use the credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enterinto these arrangements, just as we do when extending credit in the form of a loan. We monitor off-balance sheet credit instruments in order toavoid undue concentrations in any geographic region or industry.\\nFor the credit commitments outlined in the preceding paragraphs, in the absence of an event that triggers a default, early termination by BMO\\nmay result in a breach of contract.\\nFurther information on these instruments can be found in Note 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nCautionThis Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section contains forward-looking statements.

A disciplined and integratedapproach to managing risk is fundamental to the success of our operations. Our risk management framework providesindependent risk oversight across the enterprise and is integral to building competitive advantage.\\nEnterprise-Wide Risk Management outlines BMO’s approach to managing the key financial risks and other related risks that are inherent in these\\nbusiness activities, as discussed in the following sections:\\n68 Risks That May Affect Future Results\\n72 Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework77 Credit and Counterparty Risk85 Market Risk90 Insurance Risk91 Liquidity and Funding Risk100 Operational Non-Financial Risk\\n104 Legal and Regulatory Risk107 Strategic Risk107 Environmental and Social Risk109 Reputation Risk\\nText and tables presented in a blue-tinted font in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section of the MD&A form an integral part of the 2024 audited ann ual consolidated\\nfinancial statements. They present required disclosures as set out by the International Accounting Standards Board in IFRS 7, Financial Instruments – Disclosures, which\\npermits cross-referencing between the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the MD&A. Refer to Notes 1 and 5 of the audited annual consol idated financial\\nstatements.\\nRisks That May Affect Future Results\\nTop and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results\\nBMO’s overall risk profile can be impacted by evolving internal and external events. These events have the potential to affect our business and our\\noperational and financial results. Our risk management life cycle is a continuous process designed to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report o n\\nrisks arising from these events. These event-related risks are raised for discussion with the Board of Directors, senior management and businessleaders at several forums, incorporating both bottom-up and top-down approaches. Risks are examined and assessed by scenario analysis. Ourexposure to certain events is addressed through action plans developed based on these risk assessments.\\nThe following risks are considered to have the potential to materially impact BMO’s financial results, operational efficiency, strategic directio n\\nor reputation.\\nGeneral Economic Conditions\\nThe prevailing economic conditions in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business affect our financial results an d\\nbusiness operations. These conditions include the level of economic growth, interest rates and central bank actions, inflation, labour markets andunemployment rates, and the activity level and volatility of financial markets. The Canadian economy lost momentum in fiscal 2024, in response tohigher interest rates, but has shown continued resilience as a result of high levels of household savings, expansionary fiscal policies, and robustpopulation growth driven by immigration. Changes to Canada’s immigration policies are expected to slow population growth. Although the labourmarket has weakened in both countries, employment growth remains positive. Inflation has moderated, although some price pressures in theservices sector persist. The inflation rate has continued to moderate after reaching a four-decade high in fiscal 2022 in response to weaker labourmarkets, lower commodity prices and improved global supply chains. Policy rates are easing in Canada and the United States; however, longer-termborrowing costs, though falling, remain elevated. With the upcoming renegotiation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Trade Agreement in 2026,there is a risk that the free trade agreement may end, which could result in disruptive and costly tariffs on trade flows among the three nations.These factors represent risks for market stability and economic growth. Changes in economic conditions can affect consumer spending, housingprices, business investment and capital markets activity, and in turn, affect our business, including the demand for our lending and deposit product s,\\nnet interest income, fee revenue, operating expenses, credit losses and asset values. In fiscal 2024, the above factors had, and may continue to have,an impact on consumers and the operations of our clients, as well as a negative effect on our earnings, including lower loan and deposit demand, andhigher provisions for credit losses.\\nManagement regularly monitors the economic environment in which we operate, in order to identify significant changes in key economic\\nindicators, so that we can assess BMO’s portfolio and business strategies, and develop contingency plans to address any adverse developments.\\n68BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 57', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 6, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667311', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 57\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Cyber and Information Security Risk\\nCyber and information security risk arises from the ever-increasing reliance of our business operations on internet and cloud technologies, anddependence on advanced digital technologies to process data, combined with a hybrid work environment. In addition, rising geopolitical tensions ar e\\ncontributing to increasing global exposures to cyber security risks. These risks could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of BM O’s data\\nand information across our businesses and customer base. We are the target of attempted cyber attacks and must continuously monitor and developour systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure, as well as access to and the security of our data. Any resulti ng\\ndata breaches may lead to exposure or loss of data, including customer or employee information and the bank’s strategic or other sensitive internalinformation, and could result in identity theft, fraud or business losses. Cyber attacks could result in system failures and disruption of services, and\\nexpose the bank to litigation and regulatory risk, as well as reputational harm. Threat campaigns are becoming more sophisticated and well-organized, and often take place through third-party suppliers, which can negatively impact our business, brand and reputation, as well as customerretention and acquisition.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s cyber and information security program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nTechnology Resilience and Innovation Risk\\nTechnology resilience risk arises from a failure to maintain acceptable service levels during, as well as after, severe disruptions to critical proc esses\\nand the supporting information technology systems. Technology resilience risk exposure is increasing and driving new and more extensive regulator y\\nobligations and customer expectations related to operational resilience. This exposure challenges banks to extend their programs beyond disasterrecovery and business continuity activities, to include responses to internal and external threats of disruption. Technology resilience is critic al to\\nproviding our customers with a consistent online experience across our digital channels. Given the increasing reliance of our customers on technolo gy\\nplatforms to manage and support their personal, business and investment banking activities, it is important that we maintain platforms that functio n\\nat high levels of operational reliability and resilience, in order to protect and ensure the availability, integrity and recoverability of critical data,\\nparticularly with respect to business-critical systems.\\nTechnologies continue to evolve rapidly and are creating competitive pressures across the industry. Innovation risk is the inability to deliver new\\ntechnology solutions, services, processes and products that keep pace with rapidly evolving customer expectation and new competitors withoutdisruption to business-critical systems. New technologies may also lead to more complex regulatory, strategic and reputation risks. In alignment w ith\\nour Digital First strategy, we continue to invest in emerging technologies and talent to adapt to the dynamic environment and deliver competitiveand digitally-enabled products and services to meet our customers’ expectations for personalized and on-demand banking, pursue new businessgrowth opportunities and improve operational efficiency. We remain committed to the prudent and responsible adoption of new technologies.\\nIn alignment with BMO’s Digital First strategy, we continue to invest in risk management technology that can also enhance the customer\\nexperience, streamline processes and reduce complexity.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s technology risk program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nThird-Party Risk\\nOur use of third-party relationships continues to evolve and expand, helping us to deliver new and innovative solutions across the bank and for ourclients. While third-party relationships can be beneficial for the bank, they can give rise to risks that may threaten BMO’s operational resilience, such\\nas compromising customer data or disrupting the availability of critical products and services, which may financially impact the bank. We continue t o\\nenhance and evolve our capabilities in order to maintain effective third-party risk management and oversight and the efficient delivery of productsand services that depend on third parties.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s third-party risk program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nGeopolitical Risk and Escalating Trade Disputes\\nGeopolitical uncertainty and conflicts between countries impact global economies and may lead to market volatility. The Russia-Ukraine conflict h as\\nhad an ongoing global impact, including higher energy prices and the erosion of business confidence. The financial, energy and technology sanctionsimposed on Russia by Ukraine’s allies could lead to long-term political, economic and military turmoil between Western countries and Russia.\\nThe Middle East conflict has heightened tensions significantly in the region, and the potential for escalation could drive up energy prices, unsettl e\\nfinancial markets and slow global growth even further, which would have a direct and indirect impact on our customers.\\nCanadian and U.S. relations with China remain strained, involving trade disputes and tensions over Taiwan. The political climate in the United\\nStates could lead to a new wave of tariffs, and a U.S. commitment to expanding trade ties with Taiwan may further elevate the tension. In addition,the strategic competition between the United States and China is driving greater global fragmentation, as both countries seek to reinforce theirautonomy, limit any vulnerabilities and insulate their technology sectors. This could adversely affect business investment and prove especiallyproblematic for commodity-producing countries such as Canada that rely on a large export market. Ongoing Canada-China disputes over politicalinterference are further evidence of this discord.\\nDiplomatic relations between Canada and India have also deteriorated, which could threaten to disrupt trade flows, tourism and immigration\\nbetween the two countries.\\nWe actively monitor global and North American events and trends, and continually assess our businesses in the context of these events and\\ntrends. Although our lending portfolio has limited direct exposure outside North America, our customers rely on global trade and sustained economicgrowth. To mitigate exposure to geopolitical risk, we maintain a diversified portfolio that we continually monitor, in addition to contingency plan s\\nthat are intended to prepare BMO for possible adverse developments. Our portfolios, business plans and capital adequacy are stress tested againstseverely adverse scenarios arising from trade-related shocks, and we build contingency plans and mitigation strategies aimed at addressing andoffsetting the consequences of possible adverse political and economic developments.\\nBMO’s credit exposure by geographic region is set out in Tables 67 to 73 in the Supplemental Information and in Note 4 of the audited annual\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 69\\n\\n\\n## Page 58\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk, including Climate Change\\nBMO is exposed to environmental and social risks, in particular climate risk related to environmental conditions and extreme weather events thatcould potentially disrupt our operations, impact our customers and counterparties, and result in lower earnings or potential losses. Factors contr ibuting\\nto heightened environmental risks include the impacts of climate change and the continued intensification of development in areas of greaterenvironmental sensitivity. Business continuity and disaster recovery plans provide us with the roadmap and tools to support the restoration,maintenance and management of critical operations and processes in the event of a business disruption.\\nWe are also exposed to risks related to borrowers that may experience financial losses or rising operating costs as a result of acute or chronic\\nchanges in climate conditions, climate-related litigation and/or policies, such as carbon emissions pricing, or a decline in revenue as new andemerging technologies and changing consumer preferences disrupt or displace demand for certain commodities, products and services. BMO’s climateambition is to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world. Our strategy seeks to capture commercialization opportunities byworking with our clients on their decarbonization journeys.\\nLegal and regulatory risk or reputation risk could arise from actual or perceived actions, or inaction, by our operations and those of our customers\\nin relation to climate change and other environmental and social risk issues, or our disclosures related to these matters. Risks related to these issu es\\ncould also affect our customers, suppliers or other interested parties, which could give rise to new risks. Globally, new and more stringent climate-related obligations are being developed, which may increase compliance requirements. Litigation or enforcement measures could arise from theseobligations to manage and report on climate-related risks.\\nRefer to the Environmental and Social Risk section for further discussion of these risks.\\nCanadian Housing Market and Consumer Leverage\\nElevated household debt continues to be a headwind for household spending and broader economic activity. The combination of still restrictiveinterest rate policy that results in higher mortgage payments at renewal and rising unemployment could further increase credit losses, particularl yi n\\nunsecured consumer credit. While recent and expected rate reductions by the Bank of Canada are alleviating pressure on Canadian households, thehousing market recovery will likely be constrained by the persistent lack of affordability, notably in Ontario and British Columbia, which could lim it\\nmortgage origination volumes. The risk of credit losses in our mortgage portfolio is in part mitigated by low loan-to-value and prudent underwritingpractices that stress test customers’ ability to service mortgage debt at higher interest rates. While portfolio stress test analysis suggests that even\\nsignificant price declines and challenging economic conditions would result in manageable losses, primarily due to insurance coverage and thelevel of equity held by owners with seasoned loans, delinquencies and insolvencies in our portfolio could adversely affect our results andfinancial condition. In addition, consumer loan losses could rise if unexpected economic weakness results in a significant further increase in theunemployment rate.\\nRegulatory Environment and Changes\\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated, and BMO has experienced increasing complexity in regulatory requirements and expectations, a s\\ngovernments and regulators around the world continue to pursue major reforms intended to strengthen the stability of the financial system andprotect key markets and participants. These reforms may lead to further increases in regulatory capital or liquidity requirements and additionalcompliance costs, which could lower returns and affect growth. Such reforms could also affect the cost and availability of funding and the level of thebank’s market-making activities. Regulatory reforms may also impact fees and other revenues for certain operating groups. In addition, difference si n\\nthe laws and regulations enacted by a range of national regulatory authorities may offer advantages to our international competitors, which couldaffect our ability to compete. We monitor such developments, and other potential changes, so that we are well-positioned to respond and implementany necessary changes. BMO is subject to legal proceedings, including investigations by regulators. Failure to comply with applicable legal andregulatory requirements and expectations could result in further legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions and fines, enforceme nt\\nactions, criminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in invest or and\\ncustomer confidence, and damage to our reputation.\\nRefer to the Legal and Regulatory Risk section for further discussion of these risks.\\nOther Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nFiscal and Monetary Policies and Other Economic Conditions in the Countries in which BMO Conducts BusinessFiscal and monetary policies and other economic conditions prevailing in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do businessmay impact profitability and heighten economic uncertainty in specific businesses and markets, which may in turn affect our customers andcounterparties, reduce profitability and contribute to a greater risk of credit losses. Levels of business debt remain elevated due to the residual e ffects\\nof the pandemic and the loss of governmental supports, which could impact our markets and our operating results. Interest rate fluctuations couldhave an impact on our earnings, the value of our investments, the credit quality of our loans to customers and counterparty exposure, as well as thecapital markets that we access.\\nFluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to other currencies have affected, and could continue to affect, the business operations\\nand results of clients with significant earnings or input costs denominated in foreign currencies. Our investments in operations outside of Canada a re\\nprimarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and the foreign exchange impact on our U.S.-dollar-denominated risk-weighted assets and capital deduction s\\nmay result in variability in our capital ratios. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section for further discussion of these risks. The v alue\\nof the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar will also affect the contribution of U.S. operations to Canadian-dollar profitability.\\nHedging positions may be taken to manage interest rate exposures and foreign exchange impacts, and to partially offset the effects of Canadian\\ndollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations on the bank’s financial results.\\nRefer to the 2024 Financial Performance Review – Foreign Exchange section and the Market Risk section for a more complete discussion of our\\nexposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.\\n70BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 59\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Tax Legislation and Interpretations\\nLegislative changes and changes in tax policy, including their interpretation by tax authorities and the courts, may impact earnings. Tax laws, as we ll\\nas interpretations of tax laws and policy by tax authorities, may change as a result of efforts by the Canadian and U.S. federal governments, other G20governments and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to increase taxes, broaden the tax base globally and improvetax-related reporting. For example, in fiscal 2024, the Canadian government enacted legislation to adopt the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BaseErosion and Profit Shifting two-pillar plan (Pillar 2) for international tax reform, which will levy a 15% minimum tax on operations globally.\\nFor further discussion, refer to the Future Changes in Accounting Policies – IAS-12, Income Taxes section.\\nChanges to Business Portfolio\\nAs part of its overall business strategy, BMO may acquire companies, businesses and assets. Although we conduct thorough due diligence beforecompleting these acquisitions, some acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our financial or strategic objectives or expectations. We may b e\\nsubject to regulatory and shareholder approvals to successfully complete an acquisition, and it may not be feasible to establish when, if or on whatterms the necessary approvals will be granted. Changes in the competitive and economic environment, as well as other factors, may result in adecline in revenue or profitability, while higher than anticipated integration costs and failure to realize anticipated cost savings after an acqui sition\\ncould also adversely affect earnings. Integration costs may increase because of regulatory costs related to an acquisition, operational loss event s,\\nother unanticipated expenses that were not identified in the due diligence process or demands on management time that are more significant thananticipated, as well as unexpected delays in implementing certain plans that may, in turn, lead to delays in achieving full integration. Successful p ost-\\nacquisition performance depends on retaining the clients and key employees of acquired companies and businesses and on integrating key systemsand processes without disruption.\\nBMO also evaluates potential dispositions of assets and businesses that may no longer meet strategic and financial objectives. When we seek to\\nsell assets or dispose of a business, we may have difficulty obtaining buyers or devising alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timel y\\nmanner, which could delay the achievement of strategic objectives. We may also dispose of assets or a business on terms that are less favourablethan anticipated or lead to adverse operational or financial impacts, or greater disruption than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on reven ue\\ngrowth may be greater than forecast. Dispositions may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions and the granting of governmental or regulatoryapprovals on acceptable terms that, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent the completion of a disposition as intended, or at all.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Judgments and Accounting Standards\\nBMO prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Changes that the International Accounting Standards Board makes fromtime to time may materially affect the way we record and report financial results. Future changes in accounting policies are discussed in the FutureChanges in Accounting Policies section, as well as in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe application of IFRS requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and\\nliabilities, certain amounts reported in net income and other related disclosures. In making these judgments and estimates, we rely on the bestinformation available at the time. However, it is possible that circumstances may change, new information may become available or models mayprove to be imprecise.\\nBMO’s financial results could be affected for the period during which any such new information or change in circumstances becomes apparent,\\nand the extent of the impact could be significant. More information is included in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section.\\nCautionThe Risks That May Affect Future Results section and the remainder of this Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section contain forward-looking stateme nts.

Our Enterprise Risk and Portfolio\\nManagement (ERPM) group oversees the implementation and operation of the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework (ERMF), and providesindependent review and oversight across the enterprise on risk-related issues, in order to enable prudent and measured risk-taking that is integrat ed\\nwith business strategy. All elements of the ERMF function together to support informed and effective risk management, while striking an appropriatebalance between risk and return.\\nThe ERMF guides our risk-taking activities in order to align them with customer needs, shareholder expectations and regulatory requirements. We\\nhave established a risk governance framework as part of the ERMF that serves as the foundation for consistent and effective management of risksfacing the bank, outlining our approach to understanding and managing risk, protecting BMO’s reputation, diversifying and limiting potential tail risk,\\nmaintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, and optimizing risk return. In addition, the ERMF defines roles and responsibilities across al l three\\nlines of defence. It incorporates our Risk Management Life Cycle and informs our efforts to identify, assess, manage (which includes mitigation),monitor and report on our exposure to material risks. The ERMF is driven by our people, processes and technology, along with a range of riskmanagement tools, including modelling and analytics, stress testing and scenario analysis, and our Risk Taxonomy. All elements of the ERMF aresupported by our risk culture and provide for direct management of each individual risk type, as well as the management of risk on an integratedbasis.\\nRisk Management Tools\\n(e.g.: Stress Testing, Scenario Analysis, Modelling, Analytics)Enterprise Risk Management Framework\\nRisk Culture\\n\\x81 Tone from the top\\n\\x81 Accountability\\x81 Effective communication and challenge\\n\\x81 IncentivesRisk Management EnablementIDENTIFY ASSESS MANAGE MONITOR REPORT Risk Management Life Cycle\\nRisk Taxonomy \\x81 Credit & Counterparty\\n\\x81 Market\\x81 Liquidity & Funding\\n\\x81 Insurance\\x81 Non-Financial**\\n\\x81 Reputation\\x81\\n\\x81Risk Governance\\nBoard\\n(RRC*, ACRC*)\\nSenior Management\\n(RMC*, ERC* & Management Committees*)\\nRisk Appetite Framework\\nPolicy Framework\\n1st Line\\nOperating Groups, Technology &\\nOperations, Corporate Services2nd Line\\nEnterprise Risk & Portfolio Management,\\nLegal & Regulatory Compliance3rd Line\\nCorporate Audit \\nDivisionRisk Management Approach Maintain strong capital and liquidity Diversify; limit tail risk Optimize risk return Understand and manage Protect our reputation\\nPeople - Process - Technology\\nRisk Governance\\nThe ERMF outlines a governance approach that includes robust Board of Directors and senior management oversight, a Risk Appetite Framework, the\\nEnterprise Policy Framework and the corresponding roles in the three-lines-of-defence operating model.\\nBoard of Directors and Senior Management Oversight\\nSpecific policies approved by our Board of Directors govern our approach to the management of material risks, and oversight is exercised at everylevel of the enterprise through a hierarchy of committees and individual responsibilities, as outlined in the following diagram. The Board of Direct ors\\nseeks to ensure that corporate objectives are supported by a sound risk strategy, prudent risk appetite and an effective ERMF that is appropriate tothe nature, scale, complexity and risk profile of our lines of business and other operations. The Board also has overall responsibility for oversight of\\nthe bank’s governance framework and corporate culture. Senior management reviews and discusses significant risk issues and action plans as theyarise in the implementation of the enterprise-wide strategy, exercising oversight and governance of the risks taken across the enterprise and theprocesses through which exposures to such risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported on, in accordance with policies, and heldwithin approved limits and risk tolerances.\\nThe ERMF is reviewed on a regular basis by the Risk Review Committee (RRC) of the Board of Directors, in order to exercise oversight and guide\\nrisk-taking activities.\\n72BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 61\\n\\n                          MD&A                          \\n(2) Co-chaired by the Chief Finan cial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.\\n(3) Chaired by the Chief Risk Officer.\\n(4) Chaired by the General Counsel.(5) Co-chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.(6) Co-chaired by the General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.Board/BoardCommittees\\nManagement\\nCommitteesBoard & Senior Management Oversight (1)\\nBoard of Directors\\nRisk Review Committee\\n(RRC)Audit and Conduct Review\\nCommittee (ACRC)\\nRisk Management\\nCommittee (RMC) (3)Reputation Risk Management\\nCommittee (RRMC) (4)Asset Liability\\nCommittee (ALCO) (5)Enterprise Regulatory \\nCommittee (ERC) (6)Enterprise Capital\\nManagement\\nCommittee (ECMC) (2)\\n(1) Reporting relationships shown in dotted lines, sub-committees shown as solid lines.\\nIn addition to the oversight exercised by the Board of Directors and senior management, effective governance of the bank’s risks is overseen by\\nmanagement committees and supported by the three-lines-of-defence operating model, which addresses risks across the operating groups andCorporate Services.\\nBoard of Directors is responsible for supervising the management\\nof the business and affairs of BMO. The Board, either directly orthrough its committees, is responsible for oversight of the followingareas: strategic planning; defining risk appetite; identifying andmanaging risk; managing capital; fostering a culture of integrity;internal controls; succession planning and evaluation of seniormanagement; communication; public disclosure; and corporategovernance.\\nRisk Review Committee (RRC) of the Board of Directors assists the\\nBoard in fulfilling its risk management oversight responsibilities.This includes overseeing a strong risk culture; overseeing theidentification, assessment and management of BMO’s risks;monitoring adherence to risk management corporate policies andcompliance with risk-related regulatory requirements; and evaluatingthe effectiveness of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), in conjunction withthe Human Resources Committee, including input into successionplanning for the CRO. The ERMF is reviewed at least annually by theRRC, and guides risk-taking activities and sets out the bank’sapproach to risk management.\\nAudit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Board of\\nDirectors assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilitiesfor the integrity of BMO’s financial reporting and sustainabilityreporting, including the effectiveness of BMO’s internal controls; theinternal audit function; the qualifications, independence andperformance of the independent auditors; BMO’s compliance withlaws and regulations; transactions involving related parties; conflictsof interest and confidential information; standards of businessconduct and ethics; cyber security; and consumer protectionmeasures and complaints.\\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) is directly accountable to the Board for\\nall of BMO’s risk-taking activities. The CEO is supported by the CROand the ERPM group.Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports directly to the CEO, is head of ERPM,\\nchair of RMC and reports to the RRC on risk-related matters. The CROis responsible for providing independent review and oversight ofenterprise-wide risks and leadership on risk issues, developing andmaintaining the ERMF and fostering a strong risk culture across theenterprise.\\nManagement Level Committees overseeing risk matters, including\\nthe Enterprise Capital Management Committee (ECMC), RiskManagement Committee (RMC), Reputation Risk ManagementCommittee (RRMC), Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and EnterpriseRegulatory Committee (ERC), bring together senior executivemembers of BMO management to oversee risk management acrossthe enterprise. The committees are chaired by members of theExecutive Committee, exercising risk oversight and governance fortheir respective risks at the highest levels of management.\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM) , as the second\\nline of defence, provides risk management oversight, effectivechallenge and independent assessment of risk and risk-takingactivities. ERPM supports a disciplined approach to risk-taking byexercising its responsibility for independent transactional approvaland portfolio management, policy formulation, risk reporting, stresstesting, modelling and risk education. This approach promotesconsistency in risk management practices and standards across theenterprise, and verifies that any risks accepted are consistent withBMO’s risk appetite.\\nOperating Groups and Corporate Services , including Technology\\nand Operations, are responsible for effectively managing risks byidentifying, assessing, managing, monitoring, mitigating andreporting on exposures to risk within their respective operations andlines of business, in accordance with their established risk appetite.They exercise business judgment and maintain effective policies,processes and internal controls, so that significant risk issues areescalated and reviewed by ERPM. Individual governance committeesand ERPM establish and monitor risk limits that are consistent with,and subordinate to, the Board-approved limits.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 73\\n\\n\\n## Page 62\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nRisk Appetite Framework\\nWe believe that risk management is every employee’s responsibility. This is guided by five key principles that define our approach to managing risk\\nacross the enterprise and comprise our Risk Appetite:\\n‰Understand and Manage by only taking risks that are transparent and understood.\\n‰Protect BMO’s Reputation by adhering to principles of honesty, integrity, respect and high ethical standards, in line with our Code of Conduct.\\n‰Diversify. Limit Tail Risk by targeting a business mix that minimizes earnings volatility and exposure to low-probability, high-impact events.\\n‰Maintain Strong Capital and Liquidity positions that meet, or exceed, regulatory requirements and market expectations.\\n‰Optimize Risk Return by managing risk-adjusted exposures and making decisions that create value for shareholders.\\nOur Risk Appetite Framework consists of a Risk Appetite Statement, risk limits and an outline of the responsibilities of the Board of Directors, its\\ncommittees and senior management. The Risk Appetite Statement incorporates a risk appetite, comprising both qualitative statements andquantitative measures (including risk limits), that indicates the aggregate level and types of risk that the bank is willing to assume in order to supp ort\\nsound business initiatives and drive appropriate returns and targeted growth. The risk appetite is integrated within our strategic and businessobjectives and our capital and liquidity plans, as well as the bank’s recovery and resolution plans. Our risk appetite is established by following theRisk Appetite Framework principles, supported by corporate policies, standards and guidelines, as well as committee mandates, and is developed tomeet regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. The Risk Appetite Framework assists senior management and the Board ofDirectors in assessing the bank’s risk profile against our risk appetite. Both the Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Appetite Statement are reviewedand approved by the Board of Directors annually. Our risk appetite is articulated and applied consistently across the enterprise, with operating gro ups,\\nkey businesses and entities developing their own respective risk appetite statements within this framework.\\nRisk Limits\\nRisk limits are set so that risk-taking activities remain within BMO’s risk appetite, balancing risk diversification, exposure to loss and risk-adj usted\\nreturns. These limits inform business strategies and decisions, and are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors or management or itscommittees, as appropriate, based on the level and granularity of the limits. They include:\\n‰Credit and Counterparty Risk – limits on group and single-name exposures and material country, industry and portfolio/product segments.\\n‰Market Risk – limits on economic value and earnings exposures to stress scenarios and significant market movements, as well as limits on value at\\nrisk and stress related to trading and underwriting activities.\\n‰Insurance Risk – limits on policy exposures and reinsurance arrangements.\\n‰Liquidity and Funding Risk – minimum limits governing the internal liquidity stress testing scenario, minimum regulatory liquidity ratio\\nrequirements, and maximum levels of asset pledging and wholesale funding, as well as limits related to liability diversification and exposure tocredit and liquidity facilities.\\n‰Operational Non-Financial Risk – key metrics for measuring operational and other non-financial risks that may have financial consequences.\\nThe Board of Directors, after considering recommendations from the RRC and RMC, annually reviews and approves key risk limits and then delegates\\noverall authority for these limits to the CEO. The CEO in turn delegates more specific authorities to the senior executives of the operating groups (fi rst\\nline of defence), who are responsible for the management of risk in their respective operations, and to the CRO. These delegated authorities allowrisk officers to set risk tolerances, approve geographic and industry sector exposure limits within defined parameters, and establish underwritin g and\\ninventory limits for trading and investment banking activities. The criteria under which more specific authorities may be delegated across theorganization, as well as the requirements relating to documentation, communication and monitoring of those specific delegated authorities, are se t\\nout in corporate policies and standards.\\nEnterprise Policy Framework\\nThe Enterprise Policy Framework includes a comprehensive set of risk-related corporate policies, each of which is approved by the RRC, ACRC or theBoard of Directors, as well as corporate standards issued pursuant to those corporate policies that have been reviewed by the RMC and approved bysenior management. Corporate policies and standards collectively outline the principles, expectations, and roles and responsibilities of seniormanagement for ensuring that exposures to key risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported. Corporate policies and standardsare reviewed and updated at a minimum every two years.\\nThe Enterprise Policy Framework also includes supporting directives and procedures that apply across the first and second lines of defence to\\noperationalize the requirements, roles and responsibilities, and frameworks outlined in those corporate policies and standards.\\n74BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 63', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 7, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667321', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 63\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Three-Lines-of-Defence Operating Model\\nOur ERMF is operationalized through the three-lines-of-defence approach to managing risk, as described below:\\n‰Operating groups and Corporate Services, which includes Technology and Operations, serve as our first line of defence. They are accountable for the\\nrisks arising from their businesses, operations and exposures. They are expected to pursue business opportunities within their established riskappetite and to identify, assess, manage (which includes mitigation), monitor and report on risks in, or arising from, their businesses, operationsand exposures. The first line fulfills its responsibilities by applying risk management and reporting methodologies, by establishing appropriateinternal controls in accordance with the ERMF, and by monitoring the effectiveness of such controls. These processes and controls serve as theframework for our lines of business to act within their delegated risk-taking authority and risk limits, as set out in corporate policies and the RiskAppetite Framework. Corporate Services, while part of our first line of defence, may also serve in a governance capacity when specific roles andresponsibilities are assigned to individuals or groups under the Enterprise Policy Framework. In such instances, governance accountabilities wil lb e\\ncarried out independent of the individuals or groups responsible for risk-taking.\\n‰The second line of defence comprises ERPM and Legal & Regulatory Compliance. The second line exercises independent oversight, performseffective challenge and provides independent assessment of risks and risk management practices, including transactions, product and portfolio ri sk\\nmanagement decisions, regulatory compliance, and processes and controls applied in the first line of defence. The second line establishesenterprise-wide risk management policies, frameworks, processes, methodologies and practices that the first and second lines use to identify,assess, manage (which includes mitigation), monitor and report on risks across the enterprise.\\n‰Corporate Audit Division is the third line of defence. It provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls across theenterprise, including controls that support the risk management and governance processes, and reports its findings to the Board of Directors.\\nRisk Taxonomy\\nOur Risk Taxonomy categorizes the key risks to which BMO is exposed and p rovides a framework for the risk management life cycle in relation to\\neach of the key risks. Our Risk Taxonomy incorporates exposures to financ ial risks (Credit and Counterparty Risk, Market Risk, Insurance Risk and\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk), non-financial risks (Operational Non-Finan cial Risk and Legal and Regulatory Risk) and transverse risks, which inter sect\\nwith both financial and non-financial risks (Strategic Risk, Environment al and Social Risk and Reputation Risk ). We maintain sub-categories under\\neach Tier 1 risk to support effective risk management practices as part of the overall ERMF. Failure in managing these risks, or in controlling our\\nexposures to them, could have material financial consequences for BMO.\\nRisk Management Life Cycle\\nRisk Identification, Assessment and ManagementRisk identification is an integral step in recognizing the key inherent risks that BMO faces, assessing the potential for loss and then acting to\\nmitigate this potential. Our Risk Taxonomy documents the key risks, suppo rting the implementation of our Risk Appetite Framework and assisting in\\nidentifying the primary risk categories for which stress capital consumpti on is estimated. Risk review and approval processes are established base d\\non the nature, size and complexity of the risks involved. Generally, t hese involve a formal review and approval by either an individual or a\\ncommittee that is independent of the originator. Delegated a uthorities and approvals by category are outlined below.\\n‰Portfolio transactions – transactions are approved through risk assessment processes for all types of transactions at all levels of the enterprise,\\nwhich include operating group recommendations and ERPM approval of credit risk, and transactional and position limits for market risk.\\n‰Structured transactions – new structured products and transactions with significant legal and regulatory, accounting or tax implications are\\nreviewed by the Global Markets Risk Committee, as appropriate, and are also assessed under the operational risk management process if theyinvolve structural or operational complexity that may give rise to significant operational risk. Transactions that may give rise to significant orheightened reputation risk are reviewed by the Reputation Risk Management Committee.\\n‰Investment initiatives – documentation of risk assessments is formalized through the investment assessment and approval process, and is\\nreviewed and approved by Corporate Services based on the size of an initiative’s investment spending and its inherent risk.\\n‰New products and services – policies and procedures for the approval of new or modified products and services offered to customers are the\\nresponsibility of both the first and second lines of defence, including appropriate senior business leaders, and are reviewed and approved bysubject matter experts and senior management in Corporate Services, as well as by other senior management committees.\\nRisk Monitoring and Reporting\\nRisk-Based Capital AssessmentTwo measures of risk-based capital are used by BMO: economic capital and regulatory capital. Both are aggregate measures of the risk that the bankassumes in pursuit of its financial objectives, and enable the evaluation of returns on a risk-adjusted basis. Our operating model provides for thedirect management of each type of risk, as well as the management of material risks on an integrated basis. Measuring the economic profitability oftransactions or portfolios involves a combination of both expected and unexpected losses to assess the extent and correlation of risk beforeauthorizing new exposures. Both expected and unexpected loss measures for a current transaction or portfolio reflect current and future marketconditions, the inherent risk in the position and, as appropriate, its credit quality. Risk-based capital methods and material models are reviewed a t\\nleast annually and updated as appropriate. The risk-based capital models provide a forward-looking estimate of the difference between themaximum potential loss in economic (or market) value and expected loss, measured over a specified time interval and using a defined confidencelevel.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 75\\n\\n\\n## Page 64\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nStress Testing\\nStress testing is a key element of our risk management and capital management frameworks. It is integrated into our enterprise and group riskappetite statements and embedded in our management processes. To evaluate risks, we regularly test a range of scenarios, which vary in frequency,severity and complexity, in portfolios and businesses across the enterprise. In addition, we participate in regulatory stress tests in multiplejurisdictions.\\nQuantitative models and tools, along with qualitative evaluations, are utilized to assess the impact of changes in the macroeconomic\\nenvironment on the income statement and balance sheet and the resilience of the bank’s capital position over a forecast horizon. Models utilized forstress testing are approved and governed under the Model Risk Management Framework, and are used to establish a better understanding of ourrisks and to test our capital adequacy.\\nBMO’s stress testing framework integrates stress testing at the line of business, portfolio, industry, geographic and product level, and embeds\\nthe test results in strategy, business planning and decision-making. Targeted portfolio, industry and geographic analysis is conducted by ERPM andthe lines of business to test risk appetite, limits, concentration and strategy. Ad hoc stress testing is conducted in response to changing economic o r\\nmarket conditions and in order to assess business strategies.\\nEnterprise stress testing is conducted to support BMO’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and target-setting through analysis\\nof the potential effects of low-frequency, high-severity events on our earnings, our balance sheet, and our liquidity and capital positions. Scenar io\\nselection is a multi-step process that considers material and idiosyncratic risks and the potential impact of new or emerging trends on risk profiles ,a s\\nwell as on the macroeconomic environment. Scenarios may be defined by senior management or regulators. The economic impacts are determinedby the Economics group, which distills the scenarios into macroeconomic and market variables that include, but are not limited to, GDP growth, yieldcurve estimates, unemployment rates, real estate prices, stock index growth and changes in corporate profits. These macroeconomic variables drivestress loss models, tools and qualitative assessments that are applied to determine estimated stress impacts. The scenarios are used by operating,risk and finance groups to assess a broad range of financial impacts that BMO could experience as a result of a specific stress, as well as in theordinary course of business, and extraordinary actions anticipated in response to that stress.\\nGovernance of the stress testing framework resides with senior management, including the Enterprise Stress Testing Committee. This committee\\ncomprises business, risk and finance executives, and is accountable for reviewing and challenging enterprise-wide scenarios and stress test resul ts.\\nStress testing and enterprise-wide scenarios associated with the ICAAP, including recommendations for actions that the enterprise could take in or der\\nto manage the impact of a stress event, are established by senior management and presented to the Board of Directors. Oversight and governance ofthe stress testing associated with the Horizontal Capital Review (HCR), which is a U.S. regulatory requirement for BMO Financial Corp. (BFC), areexercised at the BFC level by its Board of Directors through its Risk Oversight and Capital Committee.\\nRefer to the Environmental and Social Risk section for a discussion of our climate scenario analysis program.\\nRisk Culture\\nRisk culture at BMO is the set of shared norms, attitudes and behaviours rela ted to risk awareness, risk-taking and risk management. Sound risk cultur e\\nis designed to support appropriate behaviours and judgments about risk-ta king, and promotes effective risk management and the alignment of risk-\\ntaking activities with BMO’s Risk Appetite. Our risk culture informs and su pports our overall organizational culture. We are committed to high ethic al\\nstandards, grounded in our values of integrity, empathy, diversity and r esponsibility. ERPM is responsible for the development and promotion of a\\nhealthy, strong risk culture across the enterprise. In pursuing this manda te, ERPM works closely with Legal & Regulatory Compliance and its Ethics Of fice,\\nas well as People & Culture. BMO’s risk culture is founded on four guiding prin ciples that together reinforce its effectiveness across the bank: Tone f rom\\nthe Top, Accountability, Effective Communication and Challenge, and Incentives.\\n‰Tone from the Top: Our risk culture is grounded in an approach to risk management that encourages openness, constructive challenge and\\npersonal accountability. Each member of senior management plays a critical role in fostering this strong risk culture among employees byeffectively communicating this responsibility and by the example of their actions. The Board of Directors oversees BMO’s corporate objectives andthe requirement that they be supported by a sound risk strategy and an effective ERMF that is appropriate to the nature, scale, complexity and riskprofile of our operations.\\n‰Accountability: BMO’s ERMF is anchored in the three-lines-of-defence approach to managing risk. Our risk culture also encourages the escalation of\\nconcerns associated with potential or emerging risks to senior management, so that those concerns can be appropriately evaluated and addressed.BMO encourages and supports an environment in which concerns can be raised without retaliation.\\n‰Effective Communication and Challenge: Timely and transparent sharing of information is integral to engaging business partners in key decisions\\nand strategy discussions, which brings added rigour and discipline to BMO’s decision-making. This not only leads to the timely identification,escalation and resolution of issues, but also encourages open communication, independent challenge and an understanding of the key risks facedby the organization, so that employees are equipped and empowered to make decisions and take action in a coordinated and consistent manner,supported by a strong and effective monitoring and control framework.\\n‰Incentives: Compensation and other incentives are aligned with prudent risk-taking. These are designed to reward the appropriate use of capital\\nand respect for the rules and principles of the ERMF, and to discourage excessive risk-taking. Risk managers have input into the design of incentiveprograms that may have an effect on risk-taking. We also maintain training programs that are designed to foster a deep understanding of BMO’scapital management and risk management frameworks across the enterprise, providing employees and management with the tools and insightsthey need to fulfill their responsibilities for independent oversight, regardless of their role in the organization.\\n76BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 65\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Credit and Counterparty Risk\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk is the potential for financial loss due to the failure of an obligor (i.e., a borrower, endorser, guarantor or counterparty)\\nto repay a loan or honour another predetermined financial obligation.\\nCredit and counterparty risk underlies every lending activity that we enter into, and also arises in the holding of investment securities, transacti ons\\nrelated to trading and other capital markets products, and activities related to securitization. Credit and counterparty risk represents the mostsignificant measurable risk we face. Effective management of credit and counterparty risk is integral to our success, since failure to do so could hav e\\nan immediate and significant impact on our earnings, financial condition and reputation.\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk Governance\\nThe Credit Risk Management Framework seeks to ensure that material credit risks to which the enterprise is exposed are identified, assessed,managed, monitored and reported on regularly. The Risk Review Committee (RRC) has oversight of the management of material risks that BMO faces,including the Credit Risk Management Framework. The framework incorporates governing principles that are defined in a series of corporate policiesand standards and are given effect through specific operating procedures. These policies and standards are reviewed on a regular basis and modifiedas necessary, so that they are current and consistent with our risk appetite. The structure, limits (both notional and capital-based), collateralrequirements, monitoring, reporting and ongoing management of credit and counterparty exposures are governed by these credit risk managementprinciples.\\nLending officers in the operating groups are responsible for recommending credit decisions based on the completion of appropriate due\\ndiligence, and they assume accountability for the related risks. In some instances, relatively small transactions may be assessed by an automateddecision-making process, or they may be approved by first-line underwriters with appropriate training, independence and oversight. Credit office rs in\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM) approve larger transactions or transactions involving greater risk and are accountable for provid ing\\nan objective independent assessment of the relevant lending recommendations and risks assumed by the lending officers. All of these individuals inthe first and second lines of defence are subject to a lending qualification process and operate in a disciplined environment with clear delegation ofdecision-making authority, including individually delegated lending limits where appropriate, which are reviewed annually or more frequently, a s\\nneeded. The Board of Directors annually delegates to the CEO discretionary lending limits for further specific delegation to senior officers. Credi t\\ndecision-making is conducted at the management level based on the size and risk of each transaction, in accordance with a range of corporatepolicies, standards and procedures governing the conduct of activities in which credit risk arises. Corporate Audit Division reviews and testsmanagement processes and controls and samples credit transactions in order to assess adherence to acceptable lending standards as set out inBMO’s Risk Appetite Statement, as well as compliance with applicable corporate policies, standards and procedures.\\nFor wholesale borrowers presenting a higher than normal risk of default, we have formal policies in place that outline the framework for\\nmanaging such accounts, as well as specialized groups that manage them, as appropriate. We strive to identify borrowers facing financial difficultyearly, and to return such accounts to an acceptable level of risk through the application of good business judgment and the implementation of soundand constructive workout solutions.\\nAll credit risk exposures are subject to regular monitoring. Performing wholesale accounts are reviewed on a regular basis, generally no less\\nfrequently than annually, with most subject to internal monitoring of triggers that, if breached, result in an interim review. The frequency of revie w\\nrises in accordance with the likelihood and size of potential credit losses, and deteriorating higher-risk situations are referred to specialized a ccount\\nmanagement groups for closer attention, as appropriate. In addition, regular portfolio and sector reviews are conducted, including stress testing and\\nscenario analysis based on current, emerging or prospective risks. Reporting is provided at least quarterly, and more frequently where appropriate ,t o\\nthe Board of Directors and senior management committees in order to keep them informed of credit risk developments in our portfolios, includingchanges in credit risk concentrations, watchlist accounts, impaired loans, provisions for credit losses, negative credit migration and significa nt\\nemerging credit risk issues. This supports the RRC and senior management committees in any related decisions they may make.\\nCounterparty credit risk (CCR) involves a bilateral risk of loss because the market value of a transaction can be positive or negative for either\\ncounterparty. CCR exposures are subject to the credit oversight, limits, risk management framework and approval process outlined above. However,given the nature of the risk, CCR exposures are also monitored under the market risk framework. In order to reduce our exposure to CCR, transactionsare often collateralized and trades may be cleared through a regulated central counterparty (CCP), which reduces overall systemic risk by standingbetween counterparties, maximizing netting across trades and insulating counterparties from each other’s defaults. CCPs mitigate the risk of defa ult\\nby any member through margin requirements (both initial and variation) and a default management process, including a default fund and otherprovisions. Our exposures to CCPs are subject to the same credit risk governance, monitoring and rating framework we apply to all other corporateaccounts.\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk Management\\nCollateral ManagementCollateral is used for credit risk mitigation purposes in order to minimize losses that would otherwise be incurred in the event of a default. Dependin g\\non the type of borrower or counterparty, the assets available and the structure and term of the credit obligations, collateral can take various forms.For wholesale borrowers, collateral can take the form of pledges of the assets of a business, such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or rea l\\nestate, or personal assets pledged in support of guarantees. For trading counterparties, BMO may enter into legally enforceable netting agreementsfor on-balance sheet credit exposures, when possible. In the securities financing business (including repurchase agreements and securities lendi ng\\nagreements), we obtain eligible financial collateral that we control and can readily liquidate.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 77\\n\\n\\n## Page 66\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nCollateral for BMO’s derivatives trading counterparty exposures primarily comprises cash and eligible liquid securities that are monitored and\\nrevalued on a daily basis. Collateral is obtained under the contractual terms of standardized industry documentation.\\nWith limited exceptions, we utilize the Master Agreement provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc., frequently with a\\nCredit Support Annex, to document our collateralized trading relationships with counterparties for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are n ot\\ncentrally cleared.\\nA Credit Support Annex entitles a party to demand a transfer of collateral (or other credit support) when its exposure to OTC derivatives of the\\nother party exceeds an agreed threshold. Collateral to be transferred can include variation margin or initial and variation margin. Credit SupportAnnexes contain, among other measures, certain thresholds and provisions setting out acceptable types of collateral, a method for their valuation(discounts are often applied to market values), the availability of the collateral for re-pledging by the recipient and the manner in which interest i st o\\nbe calculated.\\nTo document our contractual securities financing relationships with counterparties, we utilize master repurchase agreements for repurchase\\ntransactions, and master securities lending agreements for securities lending transactions.\\nOn a periodic basis, collateral is subject to revaluation based on the specific asset type. For loans, the value of collateral is initially establishe da t\\nthe time of origination, and the frequency of revaluation is dependent on the type of collateral. For certain types of collateral that change frequent ly\\n(e.g., accounts receivable and inventory), monitoring consists of borrower reporting, covenants and/or triggers, as appropriate, to provide earl y\\nwarning signs of collateral value deterioration. Periodic inspections of physical collateral may be performed, where appropriate, taking intoconsideration collateral type, borrower risk profile and the feasibility of conducting such inspections. For commercial real estate collateral, a full\\nexternal appraisal of the property is typically obtained at the time of loan origination, unless the exposure is below a specified threshold amount, i n\\nwhich case an internal evaluation and a site inspection are conducted. Internal evaluations may consider property tax assessments, purchase prices ,\\nreal estate listings or realtor opinions. The case for an updated appraisal is reviewed annually, with consideration given to the borrower risk ratin g,\\nexisting tenants and lease contracts, as well as current market conditions.\\nIn the event a loan is classified as impaired, and depending on its size, a current external appraisal, valuation or restricted use appraisal is\\nobtained and updated every 12 months, or more frequently as appropriate, as long as the loan remains classified as impaired. In Canada, forresidential real estate that has an original loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than 80%, an independent property valuation is routinely obtained at t he\\ntime of loan origination. For U.S. residential loans secured by real estate, an independent property valuation is obtained for loans that will be reta ined\\nin BMO’s loan portfolio. For certain real estate loans originated for sale to government-sponsored agencies, the requirement may be waived based onan existing valuation already on file with that agency.\\nWe may use an external service provided by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) or an automated valuation model from a third-\\nparty appraisal management provider to assist in determining either the current value of a property or the need for a full property appraisal.\\nFor insured residential mortgages in Canada with an original LTV ratio greater than 80%, the default insurer is responsible for confirming the\\ncurrent value of the property.\\nPortfolio Management and Concentrations of Credit and Counterparty Risk\\nOur credit risk governance policies require an acceptable level of diversification, intended to ensure we avoid undue concentrations of credit risk .\\nConcentrations of credit risk may exist when a relatively large number of clients are engaged in similar activities, are located in the same geographi c\\nregion or have similar economic characteristics such that their ability to meet contractual obligations could be similarly affected by changes ineconomic, political or other conditions. Limits may be specified for several portfolio dimensions, including industry, specialty segments, count ry,\\nproduct and single-name concentrations. We use a range of tools to reduce the credit risk exposures in our loan portfolio. These include asset sales,traditional securitizations, or the purchase of credit protection in the form of credit default swaps or credit insurance and risk transfer transact ions.\\nCredit risk is mitigated by obtaining protection from better-rated counterparties or high-quality collateral. Credit risk mitigation activities support our\\nmanagement of capital, and individual and portfolio credit concentration.\\nOur credit assets consist of a well-diversified portfolio representing millions of clients, the majority of them individual consumers and small to\\nmedium-sized businesses. On a drawn loans and commitments basis, our most significant credit exposure at default as at October 31, 2024 was toindividual consumers, comprising $353,309 million ($344,912 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nCredit valuation adjustments (CVA) are fair value adjustments to capture counterparty credit risk in our derivative valuations. CVA profit and loss\\n(P&L) is recognized daily and provides a mitigant to the loss from a counterparty default by recognizing the expected credit loss given thecounterparty’s probability of default, as well as our credit exposure. The risks that arise from CVA are subject to our risk governance framework andare actively monitored by a business unit reporting to trading management that has been designated to manage CVA P&L for the bank. Markethedging is performed to manage CVA risks. This activity is subject to the bank’s risk control framework in order to manage the effectiveness ofhedges, and to provide independent review and oversight. The bank calculates CVA capital using both the standardized and basic approachmethodologies for CVA.\\nWrong-Way Risk\\nWrong-way risk occurs when our exposure to a counterparty increases at the same time that the credit quality of that counterparty deteriorates.Specific wrong-way risk arises when the credit quality of the counterparty and the market risk factors affecting collateral or other risk mitigantsdisplay a high correlation, and general wrong-way risk arises when the credit quality of the counterparty, for non-specific reasons, is highly corre lated\\nwith macroeconomic or other factors that affect the value of the risk mitigant. Our procedures require that specific wrong-way risk be identified intransactions and accounted for in the assessment of risk, including any heightened level of exposure.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\n78BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 67\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Credit and Counterparty Risk Measurement\\nBMO quantifies credit risk at both the individual borrower or counterparty level and the portfolio level. In order to limit earnings volatility, mana ge\\nexpected credit losses and minimize unexpected losses, credit risk is assessed and measured using the following risk-based parameters:\\n‰Exposure at Default (EAD) represents an estimate of the outstanding amount of a credit exposure at the time a default may occur.\\n‰Loss Given Default (LGD) is a measure of BMO’s economic loss, such as the amount that may not be recovered in the event of a default, presented\\nas a proportion of the exposure at default.\\n‰Probability of Default (PD) represents the likelihood that a borrower or counterparty will go into default over a one-year time horizon.\\n‰Expected Loss (EL) is a measure of the loss that BMO is expected to incur in the normal course of business in a given period of time. EL is\\ncalculated as a function of EAD, LGD and PD.\\nUnder Basel III, OSFI permits three approaches to the measurement of credit risk: Standardized, Foundation Internal Ratings Based (FIRB) and\\nAdvanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB). BMO primarily uses the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach, which includes both FIRB and AIRB, todetermine credit risk-weighted assets (RWA) in its portfolios, including portfolios of the bank’s subsidiary BMO Financial Corp. Under the Basel II I\\nReform requirement, it is mandatory to apply FIRB to a subset of IRB exposures where LGD and EAD are based on regulatory prescribed values. Referto the Supplementary Regulatory Capital Information disclosure for details regarding the total exposure (measured as EAD) of Retail and Wholesaleportfolios under the IRB Approach to determining regulatory capital. The remaining exposures reflect waivers and exemptions to the IRB Approachand are measured under the Standardized Approach, subject to OSFI’s approval. We continue to transition all material exposures in this category tothe IRB Approach. For securitization exposures, we apply the Basel hierarchy of approaches, including the Securitization Internal Ratings BasedApproach and the External Ratings Based Approach, as well as the Standardized Approach.\\nBMO’s regulatory capital and economic capital frameworks both use EAD to assess credit and counterparty risk. Capital is calculated based on\\nexposures that, where applicable, have been redistributed to a more favourable PD band or LGD measure, or a different Basel asset class, as a resultof the application of credit risk mitigation and a consideration of credit risk mitigants, including collateral and netting.\\nTotal credit exposures at default by type and industry sector, as at October 31, 2024 and 2023, based on the Basel III classifications, are disclosed in\\nthe table below.\\nTABLE 34\\n(Canadian $ in millions) Drawn (3) (7)Commitments\\n(undrawn) (3) (8)Other off-balance\\nsheet items (3) (9) OTC derivatives (4) (10)Repo-style\\ntransactions (4) (5) (11) Total (1)\\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\\nIndividual 287,741 281,087 65,568 63,812 – 13 – – – – 353,309 344,912\\nFinancial institutions 105,378 95,366 20,484 18,690 7,447 7,201 27,393 19,307 17,712 16,177 178,414 156,741\\nGovernments 230,353 219,795 3,024 2,551 1,760 1,575 4,481 8,193 1,070 5,870 240,688 237,984\\nManufacturing 33,561 33,046 15,555 16,059 1,696 1,915 1,049 807 – – 51,861 51,827\\nReal estate 66,650 61,734 8,632 11,843 1,234 971 412 224 – – 76,928 74,772\\nRetail trade 30,595 27,825 4,262 4,621 645 441 152 129 – – 35,654 33,016\\nService industries 54,433 56,588 13,830 13,552 3,192 3,172 990 696 – – 72,445 74,008\\nWholesale trade 21,868 19,997 7,212 7,618 670 611 268 167 – – 30,018 28,393\\nOil and gas 3,180 3,335 3,010 2,889 623 788 610 1,444 – – 7,423 8,456\\nUtilities 10,068 11,101 9,304 8,767 3,799 4,547 2,444 1,850 – – 25,615 26,265\\nOthers (2) 54,173 63,210 19,247 18,132 4,343 4,009 2,306 1,634 – – 80,069 86,985\\nTotal exposure at\\ndefault (6) 898,000 873,084 170,128 168,534 25,409 25,243 40,105 34,451 18,782 22,047 1,152,424 1,123,359\\n(1) Credit exposure excluding equity, securitization and other assets, such as non-significant investments, goodwill, deferred tax assets and int angibles.\\n(2) Includes remaining industries that individually comprise less than 2% of total exposures.(3) Represents gross credit exposures without accounting for collateral.(4) Credit exposure at default is inclusive of collateral.(5) Repo-style transactions include repos, reverse repos and securities lending transactions, which represent both asset and liability exposures .

Adjudication models, behavioural scorecards, decision tree s and expert knowledge are combined to generate optimal credit decisions in a\\ncentralized and automated environment.\\nThe retail risk rating system assesses risk based on individual loan characteristics. We have a range of internally developed PD, LGD and EAD\\nmodels for each of the major retail portfolios. The principle product lines within each of the retail portfolios are modelled separately, so that the r isk-\\nbased parameters capture the distinct nature of each product. The models, in general, are based on internal historical data recorded over a multi-yea r\\nperiod that includes at least one full economic cycle, in compliance with regulatory requirements. Adjustments are incorporated into the parameter s,\\nas appropriate, to account for uncertainties. The retail parameters are tested and calibrated on an annual basis, if required, to incorporate additi onal\\ndata points and recent experience in the parameter estimation process. Risk drivers used in the retail credit models may include customer attributes\\nsuch as delinquency status and credit scores, and account attributes such as loan amounts and utilization.\\n‰APD estimate is assigned to each homogeneous pool to reflect the long-run average of one-year default rates over the economic cycle.\\n‰AnLGD estimate is calculated by discounting future recovery payments to the time of default, including collection costs.\\n‰AnEAD estimate is calculated as the balance at default divided by the credit limit at the beginning of the year. For non-revolving products, such as\\nmortgages, EAD is equal to 100% of the current outstanding balance and has no undrawn component.\\nFor capital purposes, the LGD and EAD estimates are calibrated to reflect downturn conditions. The PD, LGD and EAD estimates are updated annuallyand recalibrated as required by comparing the estimates to observed historical experience.\\nRetail Credit Probability of Default Bands by Risk RatingTABLE 35\\nRisk profile Probability of default band\\nExceptionally low ≤0.05%\\nVery low > 0.05% to 0.20%Low > 0.20% to 0.75%Medium > 0.75% to 7.00%High > 7.00% to 99.99%Default 100%\\nWholesale (Sovereign, Bank, Corporate and Commercial)\\nWithin our wholesale portfolios, an enterprise-wide risk rating framework is applied to all sovereign, bank, corporate and commercial counterpart ies.\\nOne key element of this framework is the assignment of appropriate borrower or counterparty risk ratings (BRRs). We have a range of internallydeveloped general and sector-specific BRR models, as well as portfolio-level LGD and EAD models.\\nThe BRR models capture the key financial and non-financial characteristics of the borrowers and generate a borrower-level rating that reflects the\\nrelative ranking of the default risk. The models are primarily based on internal data, supplemented by judgment as necessary, for low-defaultportfolios.\\nBRRs are assessed and assigned at the time of loan origination, and reassessed when borrowers request changes to credit facilities or when\\nevents trigger a review, such as an external rating change or a covenant breach. BRRs are typically reviewed no less frequently than annually, andmore frequent reviews are conducted for borrowers with less acceptable risk ratings. The assigned ratings are mapped to a PD reflecting the\\nlikelihood of default over a one-year time horizon. As a borrower migrates between risk ratings, the PD associated with the borrower also changes.\\nWe employ a master scale with 14 BRRs above default, and PDs are assigned to each rating within an asset class to reflect the long-run average\\nof one-year default rates over an economic cycle, supplemented by external benchmarking, as necessary.\\nAn LGD estimate captures the priority of claim, collateral, product and sector characteristics of the credit facility extended to a borrower. LGD\\nestimates are at the facility level.\\nAn EAD estimate captures the facility type, sector and utilization rate characteristics of the credit facility extended to a borrower. EAD estimates\\nare at the facility level. An EAD credit conversion factor is calculated for eligible facilities by comparing amounts drawn at the time of default and o ne\\nyear prior to default.\\nLGD and EAD models have been developed using internal data recorded over a multi-year period that includes at least one full economic cycle, in\\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. Results are benchmarked using external data when necessary and adjustments are incorporated into theparameters, as appropriate, to account for uncertainties. For capital purposes, the LGD and EAD parameters are calibrated to reflect downturnconditions.

CRE primarily refers to two distinct types of real estate businesses: income-producing real estate(office, industrial and retail space, and multi-family residential buildings with more than four dwelling units), including the construction of th ese\\nassets; and development of land and construction of properties for sale (subdivisions, condominiums and other types of property). Our primary focusis income-producing commercial real estate portfolios with stable operating performance, diversified portfolios, modest leverage and continuedaccess to capital, including those legally structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate investment funds and real estate operat ing\\ncompanies (REOCs), as well as pension funds and other established owners of income-producing commercial real estate.\\nOur CRE portfolio was $75.4 billion as at October 31, 2024 ($69.7 billion as at October 31, 2023) and accounted for 11% of total gross loans and\\nacceptances (10% as at October 31, 2023). The portfolio is well-managed, with consistent and conservative underwriting standards, strict lendingcriteria and structural resilience. As at October 31, 2024, impaired loans represented 1% of the portfolio (1% as at October 31, 2023).\\nOur CRE portfolio is well-diversified across businesses, property types and geographic regions. Given the widespread adoption of remote and\\nhybrid work arrangements, office space is one of the higher-risk portfolio segments within commercial real estate. Office CRE was $7.7 billion as atOctober 31, 2024, including $5.5 billion in the United States ($8.3 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, as at October 31, 2023). In addition tomonitoring the limits we set for the CRE portfolio, we apply lower limits on each segment, including office space, which helps us mitigate exposure torelated risks.\\nReal Estate Secured Lending\\nReal estate secured lending comprises residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) we extend to individuals, secured byresidential real estate, which is defined as residential structures with one to four dwelling units. The increases in prime interest rates duringfiscal 2022 and 2023 impacted variable-rate mortgages, resulting in extended and negative amortization. Customer actions and decreases in interes t\\nrates in fiscal 2024 have reduced extended and negative amortization compared with the prior year.

We manage loans through a credit risk framework, which includes structural elements, limits and risk mitigation. As atOctober 31, 2024, total leveraged loans outstanding, gross of risk mitigation, were $31.9 billion and represented 2% of total assets ($29.5 billionand 2%, respectively, as at October 31, 2023), of which $10.0 billion or 31% outstanding ($9.4 billion or 32% as at October 31, 2023) represented alower level of credit risk due to high-quality collateral assets, including asset-based lending and real estate. The remainder of the portfolio is we ll-\\ndiversified across sectors and includes loans to borrowers where we have relatively small hold sizes. As at October 31, 2024, $1.3 billion or 4% of allleveraged finance loans were classified as impaired ($589 million or 2% as at October 31, 2023). This portfolio is closely managed by specializedteams and within a limit structure. In addition to originating leveraged finance loans, we also underwrite leveraged finance loans, which is managedthrough the market risk framework.\\n(1) Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.\\n82BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 71\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Gross Impaired Loans\\nTotal gross impaired loans and acceptances (GIL) were $5,843 million, an increase from $3,960 million in the prior year. The increase in impairedloans was predominantly in business and government lending, with increases in several sectors.

We maintain both an allowance for credit losses on impaired loans and an allowance for credit losses onperforming loans, in accordance with IFRS. An allowance on performing loans is maintained to cover impairment in the existing portfolio for loansthat have not yet been individually identified as impaired. Our approach to establishing and maintaining the allowance on performing loans is basedon the requirements of IFRS, considering the guideline issued by our regulator, OSFI. Under the IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) expected credit\\nloss (ECL) methodology, an allowance is recorded for ECL on financial assets regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. We recognizean allowance for loss at an amount generally based on 12 months of ECL, if the credit risk at the reporting date has not increased significantly sinceinitial recognition (Stage 1). We record ECL over the remaining life of performing financial assets that are considered to have experienced a signifi cant\\nincrease in credit risk (Stage 2).\\nAn allowance on impaired loans is maintained to reduce the carrying value of individually identified impaired loans (Stage 3) to the expected\\nrecoverable amount.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) at a level that we consider appropriate to absorb credit-related losses. As at October 31, 2024,\\nthe total ACL was $4,936 million, an increase of $669 million from the prior year, reflecting higher allowances on both performing and impaired loans.The allowance on impaired loans was $731 million as at October 31, 2024, and the allowance on performing loans was $4,205 million. Theseamounts included an allowance on impaired loans of $78 million and an allowance on performing loans of $502 million, related to undrawncommitments and letters of credit that are considered other credit instruments and recorded in other liabilities. The allowance on impaired loansincreased $36 million from $695 million in the prior year. The allowance on performing loans increased $633 million from $3,572 million in the prioryear, primarily driven by portfolio credit migration, uncertainty in credit conditions and model updates, partially offset by improvement in themacroeconomic outlook, including the adoption of a fourth economic scenario, and the impact of the sale of a portfolio of recreational vehicle loans.\\nFurther details on the key assumptions used in the measurement of ACL can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section;\\ncontinuity in ACL by each product type can be found in Tables 71 and 72 in the Supplemental Information and in Note 4 of the audited annualconsolidated financial statements.\\nInternational Exposures\\nBMO’s geographic exposures to regions outside of Canada and the United States are subject to a risk management framework that incorporatesassessments of economic and political risks in each region or country. These exposures are also managed within limits based on product, entity andcountry of ultimate risk. Our total net exposure to these regions is set out in the table below.\\nThe table outlines total net exposure for funded lending and undrawn commitments, securities (including cash products, traded credit and credit\\ndefault swap activity), repo-style transactions and derivatives.

The magnitude and importance of these\\nactivities to the enterprise, along with the potential volatility of market variables, call for diligent governance and a robust market risk managem ent\\nframework that can provide effective identification, measurement, reporting and control of market risk exposures.\\nTrading and Underwriting Market Risk Governance\\nOur market risk-taking activities are subject to an extensive governance framework. The Risk Review Committee (RRC) oversees the managementof market risk on behalf of the Board of Directors and approves limits governing market risk exposures that are consistent with our risk appetite.The Risk Management Committee (RMC) regularly reviews and assesses significant market risk exposures and positions, and exercises ongoingsenior management oversight of our risk-taking activities. Both of these committees are kept apprised of specific market risk exposures and anydevelopments that could expose BMO to unusual, unexpected or unquantified risks associated with those market risk exposures, as well as othercurrent and emerging market risks. In addition, all businesses and individuals authorized to conduct trading and underwriting activities on behalf of\\nBMO are required to work within our governance framework and, as part of their first-line-of-defence responsibilities, they must adhere to allrelevant corporate policies, standards and procedures, and maintain and manage market risk exposures within specified limits and risk tolerances.In support of our risk governance framework, our market risk management framework comprises processes, infrastructure and supportingdocumentation which together support the identification, assessment, independent monitoring and control of our market risk exposures.\\nTrading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nOur trading and underwriting businesses give rise to market risk associated with buying and selling financial products in the course of meeting ourcustomers’ needs, such as market-making and related financing activities, and assisting clients to raise funds by way of securities issuance.\\nIdentification and Assessment of Trading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nAs the first step in the management of market risk, rigorous assessment processes are in place to identify market risk exposures associated with bothnew products and the evolving risk profile of existing products, including on- and off-balance sheet positions, trading and non-trading positions,leveraged loan, bond and equity underwriting, and market risk exposures arising from the domestic and foreign operations of our operating groups.\\nVarious metrics and techniques are then employed to measure identified market risk exposures. These include Value-at-Risk and stress tests, as\\nwell as sensitivity to market risk factors and position concentrations. Results are reported to the appropriate line of business, the RMC and RRC on aregular basis.\\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) measures the maximum loss likely to be experienced in the trading and underwriting portfolios, measured at a 99%\\nconfidence level over a one-day holding period. It incorporates the risk to the value of the bank’s trading and underwriting portfolios fromchanges in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices and their implied volatilities and correlations.\\nAlthough it is a useful indicator of risk, VaR has limitations, as with any model-driven metric. It assumes that all portfolio positions can be\\nliquidated within one day and that historical data can be used as a proxy to forecast future market events. In addition, VaR calculations are basedon portfolio positions at the close of business and do not reflect the impact of intra-day activity.\\nStress Tests are used to determine the potential impact of low-frequency, high-severity events on the trading and underwriting portfolios.\\nThe portfolios are measured daily against a variety of hypothetical and historical event scenarios, including the 2008 global financial crisis and t he\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, along with portfolio-specific impacts and asset class scenarios. Scenarios are continuously refined to reflect the latest mark et\\nconditions and portfolio risk exposures. Market liquidity horizons are reviewed for suitability and scenarios updated where appropriate. In addit ion,\\na range of assumptions, including the duration of the scenario and management actions, are incorporated in the stress tests to better reflect theanticipated impact on the trading and underwriting business.\\nVaR and stress testing metrics should not be viewed as definitive predictors of the maximum amount of losses that could be experienced in the\\ntrading and underwriting portfolios in any one day, as their results are based on models and estimates and are subject to confidence levels, and theestimates could be exceeded under unforeseen market conditions.\\nOur VaR model is back-tested on a daily basis, assuming there are no changes to the previous day’s closing position, and isolates the effects of\\neach day’s price movements against those closing positions. The one-day 99% confidence level VaR at the local and consolidated BMO levels iscompared with the estimated daily profit and loss (P&L) that would be recorded if the portfolio composition remained unchanged. If this P&L result isnegative and its absolute value is greater than the previous day’s VaR, a back-testing exception occurs. Each exception is investigated, explained a nd\\ndocumented.\\nModels support the measurement of our exposure to the risk of adverse outcomes for income, retained earnings and capital. We use a variety of\\nmethods to verify the integrity of our risk models, including the application of back-testing against hypothetical losses and approval by anindependent model validation team. The data and correlations that underpin our models are updated frequently, so that risk metrics reflect currentmarket conditions.\\nMarket Risk RWA is calculated using a standardized approach under Basel III for trading book activities along with foreign exchange risk in the\\nbanking book. Policies defining the activities eligible for trading book capital treatment and banking book capital treatment are used to delineatein-scope activity. Exceptions to general assumptions about trading and banking book categories are reported to OSFI. Such exceptions principally a rise\\nfrom instruments that are designated as trading under IFRS but used to hedge banking book market risks, along with deferred compensation planhedging. The fair value of instruments under exception is $1,459 million net liability and $11,571 million gross.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 85\\n\\n\\n## Page 74\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nMonitoring and Control of Trading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nLimits are set for our trading and underwriting activities, and are subject to regular monitoring and reporting.

The RMC and Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) provide ongoing senior management oversight of risk positionsand related activities.\\nStructural Market Risk Measurement\\nInterest Rate RiskStructural interest rate risk arises when changes in interest rates affect the market value, cash flows and earnings of assets and liabilities relate d\\nto our banking activities. The objective of structural interest rate risk management is to maintain high-quality earnings and maximize sustainableproduct spreads, while managing risk to the economic value of our net assets arising from changes in interest rates.\\nStructural interest rate risk primarily comprises interest rate mismatch risk and product-embedded option risk.Interest rate mismatch risk arises when there are differences in the scheduled maturities, repricing dates or reference rates of assets, liabilitie s\\nand derivatives. The net interest rate mismatch, representing residual assets funded by common shareholders’ equity, is managed to align with atarget maturity profile through interest rate swaps and securities.\\nProduct-embedded option risk arises when product features allow customers to alter the timing of cash flows, such as scheduled maturity or\\nrepricing dates, usually in response to changes in market conditions. Product-embedded options include loan prepayments, deposit redemptionprivileges and committed rates on unadvanced mortgages. Product-embedded options and associated customer behaviour are captured in riskmodelling, and hedging programs may be used to limit the level of exposure to this risk.\\nStructural interest rate risk is measured using simulations, analyses of the sensitivity of earnings and economic value, stress testing and gap\\nanalysis, in addition to other risk metrics.\\nEarnings Sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the projected 12-month pre-tax net income from a portfolio\\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions in response to presc ribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at z ero.\\nEconomic Value Sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the market value of a portfolio of assets, liabilities\\nand off-balance sheet positions in response to prescribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at zero.\\nThe models that measure structural interest rate risk incorporate project ed changes in interest rates and predi ct the likely reaction of our custome rs to\\nthese changes. For customer loans and deposits with scheduled maturit y and repricing dates (such as mortgages and term deposits), the models\\nmeasure the extent to which customers are likely to use embedded options to alter those scheduled dates and timing. For customer loans and deposits\\nwithout scheduled maturity and repricing dates (such as credit card loans a nd chequing accounts), exposure is measured using models that adjust for\\nelasticity in product pricing and reflect historical and forecasted trend s in balances. The results generated by these structural market risk model sa r e\\ninherently uncertain, as they reflect potential future pricing and custom er behaviour, which may differ from actual experience. These models have b een\\ndeveloped using statistical analysis and are independently validated an d periodically updated through regula r model performance assessment, bac k-\\ntesting and ongoing dialogue with the lines of busi ness. Models developed to predict customer beha viour are also used to support product pricing.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 87\\n\\n\\n## Page 76\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAll models are subject to BMO’s Model Risk Management Framework, which is described in more detail in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management\\nFramework section.\\nThe sensitivity of structural interest rate earnings and economic value to an immediate parallel increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the\\nyield curve is disclosed in the table below.\\nThe sensitivity of structural economic value to rising interest rates primarily reflects a lower market value for fixed-rate loans. The sensitivity of\\nstructural economic value to falling interest rates primarily reflects the impact of a higher market value for fixed-rate loans and minimum modelledclient deposit rates. The exposure of structural economic value to rising interest rates and the benefits of falling interest rates decreased relati ve to\\nOctober 31, 2023, primarily due to modelled deposit pricing being less rate sensitive at lower projected interest rate levels following the decrease in\\nterm market rates during the year. Structural earnings sensitivity quantifies the potential impact of interest rate changes on structural balance s heet\\npre-tax net income over the next 12 months. The sensitivity of structural earnings to falling interest rates primarily reflects the risk of fixed-rat e and\\nfloating-rate loans repricing at lower rates and the more limited ability to reduce deposit pricing as rates fall. The benefits of rising interest rat es to\\nstructural earnings primarily reflect the positive impact of reinvesting our net equity and non-rate sensitive deposits into assets with higher-te rm\\nrates. The benefits of rising interest rates to structural earnings increased modestly relative to October 31, 2023. The exposure of falling interes t rates\\nto structural earnings decreased relative to October 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of modelled prepayment penalty fee collection on certainprepayable instruments.\\nDuring 2024, both economic value sensitivity and earnings sensitivity remained within the limits established by the Board of Directors.\\nStructural Interest Rate Sensitivity(1) (2)\\nTABLE 45\\nEconomic value sensitivity Earnings sensitivity\\n(Pre-tax Canadian $ equivalent in millions)October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023\\nCanada (3) United States Total Total Canada (3) United States Total Total\\n100 basis point increase (693) (790) (1,483) (1,849) 139 228 367 304\\n100 basis point decrease 597 63 660 1,492 (101) (109) (210) (325)\\n(1) Losses are presented in brackets and gains are presented as positive numbers.\\n(2) Interest rate sensitivities assume an immediate and sustained parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at the end of the period, using a constant balance sheet.\\n(3) Includes Canadian dollar and other currencies.\\nThe table below presents net loans and acceptances by interest rate sensitivity.\\nTABLE 46\\n(Canadian $ in millions) 2024 2023\\nFixed rate (1)\\nContractual amounts that will reprice/repay within 3 months 213,314 213,854\\nContractual amounts that will reprice/repay after 3 months 254,872 248,688\\nFloating rate (2) 202,031 186,327\\nNon-rate sensitive (3) 8,158 15,907\\nTotal 678,375 664,776\\n(1) Includes index-based loans.\\n(2) Floating rate only includes loans that reprice immediately upon a change in interest rates.(3) Includes credit card balances that are paid when due, customers’ liability under acceptances, impaired loans and allowance for credit losses.\\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified for changes in accounting policy.\\nInsurance Market Risk\\nInsurance market risk includes interest rate and equity market risk arising from the activities of our BMO Insurance business. During the 2024 fiscal\\nyear, we entered into hedging arrangements to offset the impact of changes in interest rates and equity market values on our earnings. Thesensitivity includes the impact of these hedging relationships. The impact of insurance market risk on earnings is reflected in insurance investmen t\\nresults on our Consolidated Statement of Income, and the corresponding change in insurance contract liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.The impact of insurance market risk is not reflected in the Structural Interest Rate Sensitivity table above.\\nThe bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) effective November 1, 2023. IFRS 17 changes the fundamental principles used to\\nrecognize and measure insurance contracts, including life insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts held and investment contracts with discret ionary\\nparticipation features. This change impacts the timing of when investment-related income emerges and the associated market risk sensitivities, asthe discount rates used to calculate the present value of insurance liabilities are no longer based on the assets supporting those liabilities, but ra ther\\non the features of the insurance liabilities themselves. As such, insurance market risk largely reflects the interest rate risk arising from a mismat ch in\\nliability and asset cash flows.\\nOn transition, we applied the full retrospective approach to our creditor business and the fair value approach to all other products written prior to\\nNovember 1, 2022.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\n88BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 77\\n\\n                          MD&A                          The table below reflects the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, our net income to certain changes in interest rates, and includes the\\nestimated impact of hedging arrangements.\\nTABLE 47\\n(Pre-tax Canadian $ in millions) 2024 (1) 2023\\n50 basis point increase 6 23\\n50 basis point decrease (9) (30)\\n(1) Interest rate sensitivities assume a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at the end of the period, with no chan ge in the ultimate risk-free rate.\\nFor further information, refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section and Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial\\nstatements. In addition, information on insurance risk governance can be found in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section.\\nNon-Trading Foreign Exchange Risk\\nStructural foreign exchange risk arises primarily from translation risk related to our net investment in U.S. operations and from transaction riskassociated with U.S.-dollar-denominated net income.\\nTranslation risk arises from the potential impact that changes in foreign exchange rates could have on our reported shareholders’ equity and\\ncapital ratios. We economically manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our capital ratios. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital\\nManagement section for further discussion.\\nTransaction risk arises from the potential impact that fluctuations in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate could have on the Canadian\\ndollar equivalent of BMO’s U.S.-dollar-denominated financial results. Exchange rate fluctuations will affect future results measured in Canadia n dollars,\\nand the impact on those results is a function of the periods during which revenues, expenses and provisions for credit losses arise. Hedging positionsmay be taken to partially offset the pre-tax effects of Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations on financial results, although we did not\\nenter into any hedging arrangements in the current or prior year. If future results are consistent with results in fiscal 2024, each one cent increase(decrease) in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate would be expected to increase (decrease) the Canadian dollar equivalent of U.S. segmentnet income before income taxes for the year by $26 million, in the absence of hedging arrangements.

Insurance provides protection against the financial consequences of insured risks by transferring those risks to the insurer (underspecific terms and conditions) in exchange for premiums. Insurance risk is inherent in all of our insurance products: life insurance, annuities (whi ch\\ninclude the pension risk transfer business), accident and sickness insurance, and creditor insurance, as well as the reinsurance business. Insuran ce risk\\nconsists of:\\n‰Claims risk – the risk that the actual magnitude or frequency of claims will differ from those assumed in the pricing or underwriting process,including mortality risk, morbidity risk, longevity risk and catastrophic risk.\\n‰Policyholder behaviour risk – the risk that the behaviour of policyholders in regard to premium payments, withdrawals or loans, as well as policylapses and surrenders and other voluntary terminations, will differ from the behaviour assumed in the pricing process.\\n‰Expense risk – the risk that actual expenses arising from acquiring and administering policies and processing claims will exceed the expensesassumed in the pricing process.\\nOur risk governance practices provide effective independent oversight and control of risk within BMO Insurance. BMO Insurance’s risk management\\nframework addresses the identification, assessment, management, monitoring and reporting of risks. The framework includes: the Risk AppetiteStatement and key risk metrics; insurance risk policies and processes, including limits; capital requirements; stress testing; risk reports; the O wn Risk\\nand Solvency Assessment; and ongoing monitoring of experience. Senior management within the various lines of business uses this framework,serving as the first line of defence and assuming the primary responsibility for managing insurance risk. Second-line-of-defence oversight is prov ided\\nby the CRO, BMO Insurance, who reports to the CRO, BMO Wealth Management. Internal risk committees, the boards of directors of the BMO Insurancesubsidiaries and senior management provide senior governance and review. In particular, the Risk Committee of BMO Insurance oversees and reportson risk management activities to the insurance companies’ boards of directors on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Audit and Conduct ReviewCommittee of the Board of Directors acts as the Audit and Conduct Review Committee for BMO Life Insurance Company.\\nA robust product approval process is a cornerstone of the BMO Insurance risk management framework, as it identifies, assesses and manages\\nrisks associated with new insurance products or changes to existing products. This process, along with guidelines and practices for underwriting an d\\nclaims management, promotes the effective identification, assessment and management of insurance risk. Reinsurance transactions that transfer o r\\ncede insurance risk from BMO Insurance to independent reinsurance companies also mitigate our exposure to insurance risk by diversifying risk andlimiting claims. BMO Insurance has exited the Property and Casualty Reinsurance market, with the last remaining treaty terminated in January 2021,significantly reducing our exposure to catastrophic claims and, in turn, the risks arising from climate change. However, a certain portion of ourexposure to catastrophic claims remains as the portfolio runs off and until all outstanding claims that were made prior to the treaty termination date s\\nare settled and paid.\\nThe table below presents the sensitivities before and after risk mitigation by reinsurance and assumes that all other variables remain constant.\\nTABLE 49\\n2024 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions)Contractual service margin Profit or loss Contractual service margin Profit or loss\\nGross Net Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net\\nPolicy-related assumptions\\nMortality rates (1% increase) (1) (17) 10 1 1 (14) 9 – –\\nLapse rates (10% increase) (2) (151) (52) (10) (4) (161) (63) (4) (2)\\nExpenses (5% increase) (3) (15) (15) – – (9) (9) – –\\n(1) Mortality relates to the occurrence of death and is a key assumption for our life insurance business.\\n(2) Policies are terminated through lapses and surrenders, where lapses represent the termination of policies due to non-payment of premiums and sur renders represent the voluntary termination of\\npolicies by policyholders.\\n(3) Directly attributable operating expense assumptions reflect the projected costs of maintaining and servicing in-force policies, including as sociated directly attributable overhead expenses.\\nCaution\\nThis Insurance Risk section contains forward-looking statements.

Financial commitments include liabilities to depositors and suppliers, as well as lending, investment and pledging commitments.\\nManaging liquidity and funding risk is integral to maintaining enterprise soundness and safety, depositor confidence and earnings stability. It is BMO’s\\npolicy to maintain a level of liquid assets and funding capacity sufficient to meet our financial commitments, even in times of stress.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Governance\\nThe Corporate Treasury group and the operating groups, as the first line of defence, are responsible for the ongoing identification, assessment andmanagement of liquidity and funding risk. The Corporate Treasury group is responsible for monitoring and reporting on exposures to liquidity andfunding risk across the enterprise; develops and recommends for approval the Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework and the relatedrisk appetite statement and limits; monitors compliance with relevant corporate policies; and assesses the impact of market events on liquidity andfunding requirements on an ongoing basis.\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM), as the second line of defence, exercises oversight, conducts independent risk assessment and\\nprovides effective challenge of liquidity and funding management frameworks, policies, limits, monitoring and reporting across the enterprise.\\nThe Risk Management Committee (RMC) and Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) provide senior management oversight, and review and discuss\\nsignificant liquidity and funding policies, issues and developments that arise in the pursuit of BMO’s strategic priorities. The Risk Review Commit tee\\n(RRC) provides oversight of the management of liquidity and funding risk, annually approves the applicable policies, limits and contingency plan, a nd\\nregularly reviews liquidity and funding positions.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Management\\nBMO’s Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework is defined and authorized in alignment with corporate policies approved by our Board ofDirectors and standards approved by management. These policies and standards set out key management principles, liquidity and funding metricsand related limits, as well as roles and responsibilities in the management of liquidity and funding risk across the enterprise.\\nWe have a robust limit structure in place in order to manage liquidity and funding risk. These limits define BMO’s risk appetite for the key Stress\\nNet Liquidity Position (Stress NLP) measure, regulatory liquidity ratios, secured and unsecured funding appetite (for both trading and structuralactivities), as well as enterprise collateral pledging. Limits also establish the tolerance for concentrations of maturities, as well as requireme nts for\\ncounterparty liability diversification, business pledging activity, and the size and type of committed and uncommitted credit and liquidity facil ities that\\nmay be outstanding.\\nOperating within these limits helps to confirm that liquidity and funding risk is appropriately managed. An enterprise-wide contingency plan\\nintended to facilitate effective risk management in the event of a disruption is also in place. Early warning indicators identified in the contingenc y\\nplan are regularly monitored in order to detect any signs of rising levels of liquidity or funding risk in the market, or any exposure to other risksspecific to BMO.\\nBMO legal entities include regulated and foreign subsidiaries and branches, and as a result, movements of funds between entities in the\\ncorporate group are subject to, among other things, the liquidity, funding and capital adequacy requirements of these entities. As such, liquidity a nd\\nfunding positions are managed on both a consolidated and key legal entity basis. Liquidity and funding risk management policies and limits, informedby the laws and regulations that apply to each entity, are in place for key legal entities, and positions are regularly reviewed at the key legal entitylevel to confirm compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\\nBMO continued to maintain a strong liquidity position during fiscal 2024. Customer loans and deposits continued to grow, while wholesale\\nfunding decreased, reflecting net maturities. Our liquidity metrics, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NS FR),\\nexceeded internal targets and regulatory requirements throughout fiscal 2024.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Measurement\\nA key component of liquidity risk management is the measurement of liquidity risk under stress. We use Stress NLP as a key measure of liquidity risk.Stress NLP represents the amount by which liquid assets exceed potential funding needs under severe systemic and enterprise-specific stressscenarios, and a combination thereof. Potential funding needs may arise from obligations to repay retail, commercial and wholesale deposits that ar e\\nwithdrawn or not renewed, or to fund drawdowns on available credit and liquidity lines, as well as from obligations to pledge collateral due to ratingsdowngrades or market volatility, along with the continuing need to fund new assets and strategic investments. Potential funding needs are quantifie d\\nby applying factors to various business activities based on management’s view of the relative level of liquidity risk related to each activity. Thesefactors vary by deposit classification (e.g., retail, small business, non-financial corporate or wholesale counterparties) and deposit type (e.g ., insured,\\nuninsured, operational or non-operational deposits), as well as by commitment type (e.g., committed or uncommitted credit or liquidity facilities by\\ncounterparty type). Stress scenarios also consider the time horizon over which liquid assets can be monetized and management’s assessment of theliquidity value of those assets under conditions of market stress. These potential funding needs are assessed under severe systemic and enterprise-specific stress scenarios, and a combination thereof.\\nStress testing results are evaluated against our stated risk appetite and are considered in management’s decisions on limit-setting and internal\\nliquidity transfer pricing, and they also help to inform and shape the design of business plans and contingency plans. The Liquidity and Funding RiskManagement Framework is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing.\\nIn addition to Stress NLP, we regularly monitor positions in relation to the limits and liquidity ratios noted in the Liquidity and Funding Risk\\nManagement section above. These include regulatory metrics such as LCR, Net Cumulative Cash Flow and NSFR.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 91\\n\\n\\n## Page 80\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nUnencumbered Liquid Assets\\nUnencumbered liquid assets include high-quality assets that are marketable, can be pledged as security for borrowings, and can be converted to cash\\nin a time frame that meets liquidity and funding requirements. Liquid assets are primarily held in our trading businesses, as well as in supplementalliquidity pools that are maintained for contingent liquidity risk management purposes. The liquidity values recognized for different asset classes under\\nBMO’s risk management framework reflect management’s assessment of the liquidity values of those assets under a severe stress scenario. Liquidassets held in our trading businesses comprise cash on deposit with central banks, short-term deposits with other financial institutions, highly-r ated\\ndebt securities, equity securities and short-term reverse repurchase agreements. Supplemental liquidity pool assets primarily comprise cash ondeposit with central banks, securities, and short-term reverse repurchase agreements for highly-rated Canadian federal and provincial governmen t\\ndebt and U.S. federal government and agency debt. Substantially all supplemental liquidity pool assets meet the definition of high-quality liquidassets under Basel III. The size of the supplemental liquidity pool is integrated with our assessment of liquidity risk. In order to comply with localregulatory requirements, certain legal entities maintain their own minimum liquidity positions. There may be legal and regulatory restrictions onBMO’s ability to use liquid assets held at one legal entity to support the liquidity requirements of another legal entity.\\nIn the normal course of business, we may encumber a portion of cash and securities holdings as collateral in support of trading activities and\\nparticipation in clearing and payment systems in Canada and abroad. In addition, we may receive liquid assets as collateral and may re-pledge theseassets in exchange for cash or as collateral in support of trading activities. Net unencumbered liquid assets, defined as on-balance sheet assets, su ch\\nas BMO-owned cash and securities and securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, plus other off-balance sheet eligible collateralreceived, less assets encumbered as collateral, totalled $396.3 billion as at October 31, 2024, compared with $357.9 billion as at October 31, 2023.\\nThe increase in unencumbered liquid assets was primarily due to higher securities balances, partially offset by lower cash balances. Net\\nunencumbered liquid assets are primarily held at the parent bank level, at BMO Bank N.A. and in our broker/dealer operations. In addition to liquidassets, we have access to the Bank of Canada’s lending assistance programs, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window in the United States, theBank of England’s Sterling Monetary Framework and European Central Bank standby liquidity facilities. We do not consider central bank facilities asource of available liquidity when assessing the soundness of our liquidity position.\\nIn addition to cash and securities holdings, we may also pledge other assets, including mortgages and loans, to raise long-term secured funding.\\nAs part of the Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework, a Pledging of Assets corporate policy sets out the framework and limits forpledging financial and non-financial assets.\\nBMO’s total encumbered assets and unencumbered liquid assets are summarized in the table below.

Secured and unsecured wholesale funding for liquidtrading assets is largely shorter-term (maturing in one year or less), is aligned with the liquidity of the assets being funded and is subject to limits on\\naggregate maturities across different periods. Supplemental liquidity pools are funded largely with wholesale term funding.\\nWe maintain a large and stable base of customer deposits that, in combination with our strong capital position, is a source of strength. This\\nsupports the maintenance of a sound liquidity position and reduces our reliance on wholesale funding. Customer deposits totalled $715.3 billion asat October 31, 2024, increasing from $654.3 billion in fiscal 2023, driven by strong underlying deposit growth across all business groups.\\nTotal secured and unsecured wholesale funding outstanding, which largely consists of negotiable marketable securities, was $255.5 billion as at\\nOctober 31, 2024, with $67.5 billion sourced as secured funding and $188.0 billion sourced as unsecured funding. Total wholesale funding outstandin g\\ndecreased from $269.6 billion as at October 31, 2023, primarily due to net maturities of wholesale funding during the year. The mix and maturities ofBMO’s wholesale term funding are outlined later in this section. Additional information on deposit maturities can also be found in the ContractualMaturities of Assets and Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments section. We maintain a sizeable portfolio of unencumbered liquid assets,totalling $396.3 billion as at October 31, 2024 and $357.9 billion as at October 31, 2023, that can be monetized to meet potential fundingrequirements, as described in the Unencumbered Liquid Assets section above.\\nWholesale Funding Maturities(1)\\nTABLE 53\\nAs at October 31, 2024 As at October 31, 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions)Less than\\n1 month1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o1 2\\nmonthsSubtotal less\\nthan 1 year1t o2\\nyearsOver\\n2 years Total Total\\nDeposits from banks 2,531 1,283 556 1,222 5,592 7 – 5,599 7,714\\nCertificates of deposit and commercial\\npaper 12,023 23,099 23,525 30,838 89,485 864 – 90,349 94,372\\nBearer deposit notes 1,437 2,332 462 407 4,638 – – 4,638 954\\nAsset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) 1,702 2,453 5,114 343 9,612 – – 9,612 6,005\\nSenior unsecured medium-term notes 609 5,120 3,096 12,443 21,268 7,374 39,271 67,913 70,749\\nSenior unsecured structured notes (2) – – 14 297 311 498 10,283 11,092 9,415\\nSecured funding\\nMortgage and HELOC securitizations 25 781 909 1,474 3,189 2,752 12,246 18,187 17,916\\nCovered bonds – – – 4,117 4,117 12,267 10,585 26,969 28,412\\nOther asset-backed securitizations (3) ––––– 1,330 5,786 7,116 7,661\\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances – – – 1,460 1,460 1,391 2,782 5,633 18,148\\nSubordinated debt ––––– 2 5 8,378 8,403 8,227\\nTotal 18,327 35,068 33,676 52,601 139,672 26,508 89,331 255,511 269,573\\nOf which:\\nSecured 1,727 3,234 6,023 7,394 18,378 17,740 31,399 67,517 78,142\\nUnsecured 16,600 31,834 27,653 45,207 121,294 8,768 57,932 187,994 191,431\\nTotal (4) 18,327 35,068 33,676 52,601 139,672 26,508 89,331 255,511 269,573\\n(1) Wholesale unsecured funding primarily includes funding raised through the issuance of negotiable marketable securities.

The funding plan\\nconsiders expected maturities, as well as asset and liability growth projected for businesses in our forecasting and planning processes, and assess es\\nfunding needs in relation to the sources available. The plan is reviewed annually by the senior management committees with specific relatedresponsibilities and approved by the RRC, and is regularly updated to reflect actual results and incorporate updated forecast information.\\nRegulatory Developments\\nOSFI has announced proposed changes to its Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline that are expected to become effective in fiscal 2025.Under the proposal, BMO will be required to regularly file reports related to intraday liquidity management with OSFI. These changes are not expectedto have a material impact on our liquidity and funding practices.\\nCredit Ratings\\nThe credit ratings assigned to BMO’s short-term and senior long-term debt securities by external rating agencies are important in raising both capit al\\nand funding to support the bank’s business operations. Maintaining strong credit ratings allows us to access the wholesale markets at competitivepricing levels. Should BMO’s credit ratings experience a downgrade, our cost of funding may increase and our access to funding and capital throughthe wholesale markets could be constrained. A material downgrade of BMO’s ratings could also have other consequences, including those set out inNote 8 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe credit ratings assigned to BMO’s senior debt by rating agencies are indicative of high-grade, high-quality issues. In fiscal 2024, Moody’s,\\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch and DBRS affirmed their ratings and maintained their stable outlook on BMO.\\nTABLE 54\\nAs at October 31, 2024\\nRating agency Short-term debt Senior debt (1)Long-term deposits /\\nLegacy senior debt (2)Subordinated\\ndebt (NVCC) Outlook\\nMoody’s P-1 A2 Aa2 Baa1 (hyb) Stable\\nS&P A-1 A- A+ BBB+ StableFitch F1+ AA- AA A StableDBRS R-1 (high) AA (low) AA A (low) Stable\\n(1) Subject to conversion under the Bank Recapitalization (Bail-In) Regime.\\n(2) Long-term deposits / Legacy senior debt includes senior debt issued prior to September 23, 2018 and senior debt issued on or after September 23, 201 8 that is excluded from the Bank\\nRecapitalization (Bail-In) Regime.\\nWe are required to deliver collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of BMO’s current credit rating. The incremental collatera l\\nrequired is based on mark-to-market exposure, collateral valuations and collateral threshold arrangements, as applicable. As at October 31, 2024, we\\nwould be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties totalling $189 million, $440 million and $979 million as a result of a one-notch ,\\ntwo-notch and three-notch downgrade, respectively.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 95\\n\\n\\n## Page 84\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio\\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is calculated on a daily basis as the ratio of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) held to total net stressed cash\\noutflows over the next 30 calendar days, in accordance with OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline, and is summarized in the table below.BMO’s HQLA primarily comprises cash, highly-rated debt issued or backed by governments, highly-rated covered bonds and non-financial corporatedebt, and non-financial equities that are part of a major stock index. Net cash flows include outflows from deposits, secured and unsecured wholesalefunding, commitments and potential collateral requirements, offset by permitted inflows from loans, securities lending activities and other non- HQLA\\ndebt maturing over a 30-day horizon. Weightings prescribed by OSFI are applied to cash flows and HQLA to arrive at the weighted values and the LCR.The LCR does not reflect liquidity in BMO Financial Corp. (BFC) in excess of 100%, because of limitations on the transfer of liquidity between BFC andthe parent bank. Canadian domestic systemically important banks, including BMO, are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. The averagedaily LCR for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 was 132%, equivalent to a surplus of $61.0 billion above the regulatory minimum. The LCRincreased 4% from 128% in fiscal 2023, as higher HQLA more than offset an increase in net cash outflows. While banks are required to maintain anLCR of greater than 100% in normal conditions, they are also expected to be able to utilize HQLA during a period of stress, which may result in an LCRof less than 100% during such a period. The LCR is only one measure of a bank’s liquidity position and does not fully capture all of its liquid assets orthe funding alternatives that may be available during a period of stress. BMO’s total liquid assets are shown in the table below.\\nTABLE 55\\nAs at October 31, 2024\\n(Canadian $ in billions, except as noted)Total unweighted value\\n(average) (1) (2)Total weighted value\\n(average) (2) (3)\\nHigh-Quality Liquid Assets\\nTotal high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) * 253.4\\nCash Outflows\\nRetail deposits and deposits from small business customers, of which: 302.3 21.7\\nStable deposits 139.9 4.2\\nLess stable deposits 162.4 17.5\\nUnsecured wholesale funding, of which: 312.7 137.4\\nOperational deposits (all counterparties) and deposits in networks of cooperative banks 153.5 38.0\\nNon-operational deposits (all counterparties) 140.0 80.2\\nUnsecured debt 19.2 19.2\\nSecured wholesale funding * 23.0\\nAdditional requirements, of which: 258.7 52.4\\nOutflows related to derivatives exposures and other collateral requirements 32.4 8.7\\nOutflows related to loss of funding on debt products 2.7 2.7\\nCredit and liquidity facilities 223.6 41.0\\nOther contractual funding obligations 0.8 –\\nOther contingent funding obligations 544.3 11.3\\nTotal cash outflows * 245.8\\nCash Inflows\\nSecured lending (e.g., reverse repos) 164.0 24.1\\nInflows from fully performing exposures 18.1 9.9\\nOther cash inflows 19.4 19.4\\nTotal cash inflows 201.5 53.4\\nTotal adjusted value (4)\\nTotal HQLA 253.4\\nTotal net cash outflows 192.4\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (%) 132\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2023 Total adjusted value (4)\\nTotal HQLA 228.4\\nTotal net cash outflows 178.5\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (%) 128\\n* Disclosure is not required under the LCR disclosure standard.\\n(1) Unweighted values are calculated at market value (for HQLA) or as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflo ws).\\n(2) Values are calculated based on the simple average of the daily LCR over 62 business days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.(3) Weighted values are calculated after the application of the weights prescribed under the OSFI Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline f or HQLA and cash inflows and outflows.\\n(4) Adjusted values are calculated based on total weighted values after applicable caps, as defined in the LAR Guideline.\\n96BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 85\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Net Stable Funding Ratio\\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a regulatory metric that assesses the stability of a bank’s funding profile in relation to the liquidity value of its\\nassets and is calculated in accordance with OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline. Unlike the LCR, which is a short-term metric, the NSFRassesses a bank’s medium-term and long-term resilience. The NSFR is defined as the ratio of the amount of available stable funding (ASF) to theamount of required stable funding (RSF). ASF represents the proportion of own and third-party resources that are expected to be reliably available toa bank over a one-year time horizon (including customer deposits, long-term wholesale funding and capital). The stable funding requirements foreach institution are set by OSFI based on the liquidity and maturity characteristics of its balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures.Weightings prescribed by OSFI are applied to notional asset and liability balances to determine ASF, RSF and the NSFR. Canadian domestic systemicall y\\nimportant banks, including BMO, are required to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%. BMO’s NSFR was 117% as at October 31, 2024, equivalent to asurplus of $115.4 billion above the regulatory minimum. The NSFR increased from 115% as at October 31, 2023, as higher ASF more than offset theincrease in RSF.\\nTABLE 56\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2024\\nUnweighted value by residual maturity\\nWeighted\\nvalue (2) (Canadian $ in billions, except as noted)No\\nmaturity (1)Less than 6\\nmonths6t o1 2\\nmonths Over 1 year\\nAvailable Stable Funding (ASF) Item\\nCapital: – – – 95.4 95.4\\nRegulatory capital – – – 95.4 95.4\\nOther capital instruments –– –– –\\nRetail deposits and deposits from small business customers: 227.4 70.2 41.8 74.4 379.8\\nStable deposits 114.2 27.5 17.3 15.4 166.5\\nLess stable deposits 113.2 42.7 24.5 59.0 213.3\\nWholesale funding: 310.0 275.0 66.4 106.4 293.0\\nOperational deposits 151.0 – – – 75.5\\nOther wholesale funding 159.0 275.0 66.4 106.4 217.5\\nLiabilities with matching interdependent assets – 1.3 0.6 13.9 –\\nOther liabilities: 3.0 * * 77.5 20.5\\nNSFR derivative liabilities ** * 5 . 3 *\\nAll other liabilities and equity not included in the above categories 3.0 51.5 0.3 20.4 20.5\\nTotal ASF * * * * 788.7\\nRequired Stable Funding (RSF) Item\\nTotal NSFR high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) * * * * 18.5\\nDeposits held at other financial institutions for operational purposes – 0.2 – – 0.1\\nPerforming loans and securities: 202.3 211.3 74.3 362.1 538.3\\nPerforming loans to financial institutions secured by Level 1 HQLA – 94.1 3.2 – 4.0\\nPerforming loans to financial institutions secured by non-Level 1 HQLA and unsecured\\nperforming loans to financial institutions 32.0 61.5 8.7 21.3 65.0\\nPerforming loans to non-financial corporate clients, loans to retail and small business\\ncustomers, and loans to sovereigns, central banks and public sector entities, of which: 124.8 39.4 44.3 167.8 287.9\\nWith a risk weight of less than or equal to 35% under the Basel II standardized approach\\nfor credit risk –– –– –\\nPerforming residential mortgages, of which: 13.6 13.8 17.7 143.7 127.9\\nWith a risk weight of less than or equal to 35% under the Basel II standardized\\napproach for credit risk 13.6 13.8 17.7 143.7 127.9\\nSecurities that are not in default and do not qualify as HQLA, including exchange-traded equities 31.9 2.5 0.4 29.3 53.5\\nAssets with matching interdependent liabilities – 1.3 0.6 13.9 –\\nOther assets: 46.6 * * 101.7 94.6\\nPhysical traded commodities, including gold 9.5 * * * 8.1\\nAssets posted as initial margin for derivative contracts and contributions to default\\nfunds of CCPs * * * 17.7 15.0\\nNSFR derivative assets * * * 3.8 –\\nNSFR derivative liabilities before deduction of variation margin posted * * * 14.6 0.7\\nAll other assets not included in the above categories 37.1 41.0 0.3 24.3 70.8\\nOff-balance sheet items – – – 623.3 21.8\\nTotal RSF * * * * 673.3\\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (%) * * * * 117\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2023Weighted\\nvalue (2)\\nTotal ASF 724.1\\nTotal RSF 627.8\\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (%) 115\\n* Disclosure is not required under the NSFR disclosure standard.\\n(1) Items in the no maturity column do not have a stated maturity.

The\\ncontractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities is an input to, but is not necessarily consistent with, the expected maturity of assets andliabilities that is used in the management of liquidity and funding risk. We forecast asset and liability cash flows, under both normal marketconditions and a number of stress scenarios to manage liquidity and funding risk. Stress scenarios incorporate assumptions for loan repayments,deposit withdrawals, and credit commitment and liquidity facility drawdowns by counterparty and product type. Stress scenarios also consider thetime horizon over which liquid assets can be monetized and the related discounts (“haircuts”) and potential collateral requirements that may arisefrom both market volatility and credit rating downgrades, among other assumptions.\\nTABLE 57\\n2024\\n(Canadian $ in millions)0t o1\\nmonth1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o9\\nmonths9t o1 2\\nmonths1t o2\\nyears2t o5\\nyearsOver 5\\nyearsNo\\nmaturity Total\\nOn-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\\nAssets\\nCash and cash equivalents 62,827 ––––––– 2,271 65,098\\nInterest bearing deposits with banks 2,513 628 481 18 – – – – – 3,640\\nSecurities 6,787 14,011 7,840 6,707 9,720 21,264 84,775 172,886 72,890 396,880\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\\nresale agreements 85,185 16,803 5,701 2,330 888 – – – – 110,907\\nLoans (1)\\nResidential mortgages 1,683 3,284 6,413 6,653 9,252 52,489 77,867 33,227 212 191,080\\nConsumer instalment and other personal 581 974 1,703 1,827 2,671 14,815 24,595 18,830 26,691 92,687\\nCredit cards –––––––– 13,612 13,612\\nBusiness and government 8,647 14,418 16,461 19,448 21,828 63,613 105,740 32,444 102,394 384,993\\nAllowance for credit losses –––––––– (4,356) (4,356)\\nTotal loans, net of allowance 10,911 18,676 24,577 27,928 33,751 130,917 208,202 84,501 138,553 678,016\\nOther assets\\nDerivative instruments 5,573 7,996 7,211 2,482 1,660 6,365 8,374 7,592 – 47,253\\nCustomers’ liabilities under acceptances 3 5 9–––––––– 3 5 9\\nReceivable from brokers, dealers and\\nclients 31,916 –––––––– 31,916\\nOther 3,847 1,012 948 31 14 13 13 7,717 61,983 75,578\\nTotal other assets 41,695 9,008 8,159 2,513 1,674 6,378 8,387 15,309 61,983 155,106\\nTotal assets 209,918 59,126 46,758 39,496 46,033 158,559 301,364 272,696 275,697 1,409,647\\nTABLE 58\\n2024\\n(Canadian $ in millions)0t o1\\nmonth1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o9\\nmonths9t o1 2\\nmonths1t o2\\nyears2t o5\\nyearsOver 5\\nyearsNo\\nmaturity Total\\nLiabilities and Equity\\nDeposits (2) (3) 47,637 74,759 69,479 68,110 48,835 51,789 87,297 25,602 508,932 982,440\\nOther liabilities\\nDerivative instruments 6,769 10,541 10,828 3,311 2,160 6,470 9,112 9,112 – 58,303\\nAcceptances 3 5 9–––––––– 3 5 9\\nSecurities sold but not yet purchased (4) 35,030 –––––––– 35,030\\nSecurities lent or sold under repurchase\\nagreements (4) 99,364 7,777 721 106 1,016 1,807 – – – 110,791\\nSecuritization and structured entities’\\nliabilities 44 981 1,072 2,183 152 4,353 9,913 21,466 – 40,164\\nInsurance-related liabilities 93 89 18 18 30 83 195 701 17,543 18,770\\nPayable to brokers, dealers and clients 34,407 –––––––– 34,407\\nOther 12,409 2,968 805 144 1,611 2,492 4,058 2,799 9,434 36,720\\nTotal other liabilities 188,475 22,356 13,444 5,762 4,969 15,205 23,278 34,078 26,977 334,544\\nSubordinated debt ––––– 2 5 2 5 8,327 – 8,377\\nTotal equity –––––––– 84,286 84,286\\nTotal liabilities and equity 236,112 97,115 82,923 73,872 53,804 67,019 110,600 68,007 620,195 1,409,647\\n(1) Loans receivable on demand have been included under no maturity.\\n(2) Deposits payable on demand and payable after notice have been included under no maturity.(3) Deposits totalling $29,136 million as at October 31, 2024 have a fixed maturity date; however, they can be redeemed early (either fully or partiall y) by customers without penalty.

These losses can stem from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, humanerror or misconduct, and external events that may directly or indirectly impact the fair value of assets we hold in our credit or investmentportfolios. Examples of these risks include cyber and information security risk, technology risk, fraud risk and business continuity risk, but excl ude\\nlegal and regulatory risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and other types of financial risk.\\nOperational non-financial risk (ONFR) is inherent in all our business and banking activities and can lead to significant impacts on our operating and\\nfinancial results, including financial loss, restatements of financial results and damage to BMO’s reputation. Like other financial service organ izations,\\nwe are exposed to a variety of operational risks arising from potential failure of our internal processes, technology systems and employees, as wellas from external threats. Potential losses may be the result of process and control failures, unauthorized transactions by employees, businessdisruption, information security breaches, theft or fraud and cyber security threats, exposure to risks related to third-party relationships and d amage\\nto physical assets. For example, given the large volume of transactions that we process daily and the complexity and speed of our businessoperations, it is possible that certain operational or human errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.\\nONFR is not only inherent in our business and banking activities, it is also inherent in the processes and controls we use to manage risks. There is\\nthe possibility that errors could occur, as well as the possibility that a failure in our internal processes or systems could lead to a failure to manage or\\nmitigate risk, financial loss and reputational harm. Shortcomings or failures of internal processes, systems or employees, or of services and produ cts\\nprovided by third parties, including any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems, could lead to financial loss, restatements o f\\nfinancial results and damage to BMO’s reputation.\\nThe nature of our business activities also exposes us to the risk of theft and fraud when we transact with customers or counterparties. BMO relies\\non the accuracy and completeness of any information provided by, and any other representations made by, customers and counterparties. While weconduct due diligence in relation to such customer information and, where practicable and economically feasible, engage valuation experts and othe r\\nexperts or sources of information to assist in assessing the value of collateral and other customer risks, our financial results may be adverselyimpacted if the information provided by customers or counterparties is materially misleading and this is not discovered during the due diligenceprocess.\\nWe have established various risk management frameworks to manage and mitigate these risks, including internal controls, limits and\\ngovernance processes. However, despite the contingency plans we have in place to maintain our ability to serve our clients and minimize disruptionsand adverse impacts, and the contingency plans of our third-party service providers, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by adisruption to the infrastructure that supports our operations and the communities in which we do business, including, but not limited to, disruptioncaused by public health or other emergencies, civil disorder, acts of war or terrorism.\\nWe regularly review top and emerging risk exposures that could impact BMO’s business and operations, and we assess our preparedness to\\nproactively manage the risks we face or could face in the future. Consistent with the management of risk across the enterprise, we employ a three-lines-of-defence approach in managing our exposures to non-financial risk.\\nRefer to the Risks That May Affect Future Results – Top and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results section for further discussion of these\\nrisks.\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Governance\\nThe Operational Risk Committee (ORC), a sub-committee of the Risk Management Committee (RMC), is the primary governance committee exercisingoversight of all operational non-financial risk management matters, including: providing direction on, and monitoring against, strategic object ives and\\ndeliverables; and improving operational resilience, with the objective of maintaining BMO’s reputation for preventing avoidable operating failu res and\\nmistakes. As part of its governance responsibilities, the ORC reviews and recommends corporate policies and standards to the Risk Review Committee(RRC), the RMC and senior executives for review and approval as required, as well as the methodologies and tools that comprise the governingprinciples of the Operational Non-Financial Risk Management (ONFRM) framework. The documentation that gives effect to these governing principlesis reviewed on a regular basis in order to confirm that it incorporates sound governance practices and is consistent with BMO’s risk appetite. Regularanalysis and reporting of our enterprise operational risk profile to the various committees (ORC, RMC and RRC) are important elements of our riskgovernance framework. Operational risk reporting provides an integrated view of top and emerging risks, trends in loss data, capital consumption,key risk indicators (KRIs) and operating group profiles. We continue to invest in our reporting platforms, supporting timely and comprehensivereporting capabilities in order to enhance risk transparency and facilitate the proactive management of operational risk exposures.\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Management\\nAs the first line of defence, the operating groups and Corporate Services are accountable for the day-to-day management of non-financial risk,including the Chief Risk Officers of our businesses, who provide governance and oversight for their respective business units, along with CorporateServices, which provides additional governance and oversight in certain targeted areas. Operational Risk Officers independently assess the opera tional\\nrisk profiles of our operating groups, identify material exposures and potential weaknesses in our product, service and process-based risk and cont rol\\nenvironment, and recommend appropriate mitigation strategies and actions.\\nIndependent risk management oversight is provided by ONFRM, which is responsible for developing and implementing effective risk-related\\nstrategies, tools and policies, and for exercising second-line oversight, effective challenge and governance. ONFR sets out and maintains the ONFR M\\nframework, which defines the processes to be used by the first line of defence to identify, assess, manage, monitor, mitigate and report on keyoperational risk exposures, losses and near-miss operational risk events with significant potential impact. In addition, the ONFRM framework sets out\\nthe processes by which ONFRM, as the second line of defence, guides, supports, monitors, assesses and communicates with the first line in itsmanagement of operational non-financial risks.\\n100 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 89', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 11, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667361', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 89\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Implementing the governing principles of the ONFRM framework also involves continuing to strengthen our risk culture and reinforce ethical and\\nresponsible behaviour by setting clear expectations from leadership, promoting greater awareness and understanding of non-financial risk across all\\nthree lines of defence, learning from loss events and near-misses, providing related training and communication, and aiming to ensure effectivepositive reinforcement and consequence management. BMO’s Board of Directors has overall accountability for BMO’s culture. We continue tostrengthen our second-line-of-defence support and oversight capabilities with an enhanced Operational Non-Financial Risk Operating Model, whic h\\ntakes a differentiated approach based on the nature of the underlying risk and existing organizational structures.\\nThrough the implementation and oversight of the ONFRM framework, we seek to maintain an operational risk profile that is consistent with our\\nrisk appetite and supported by adequate capital, and reflects our commitment to an ethical culture defined by BMO’s values, including integrity andresponsible risk management, reinforced by enhanced operational resilience. Operational resilience is an organization’s ability to protect and s ustain\\ncore business products and services that are essential for its clients, both during the normal course of business and when experiencing operationalstress or disruption. It involves the ability to deal with unpredictable events and adapt to changes and external circumstances, and is an outcome ofeffective management of ONFR. Operational resilience is a positive, forward-looking strategic positioning that allows us to take measured risks wi th\\nconfidence and prepare BMO to withstand challenges in the market arising from both expected and unexpected events.\\nIn August 2024, OSFI released Guideline E-21, which sets out revised operational risk management and new operational resilience requirements\\nfor financial institutions. We are further enhancing our program to comply with these requirements by September 2026.\\nThe following are the key programs, methodologies and processes set out in the ONFRM framework that assist us in the ongoing review of our\\noperational non-financial risk profile:\\n‰BMO has transitioned to a new program for the assessment of non-financial risk, known as Product/Service and Process Risk Assessment . This\\nprogram is used by our operating groups and Corporate Services to assess the controls and residual risk exposures in their business operations byfocusing on the key controls applied to their products, services, internal activities and processes. It provides a current and forward-looking view of\\nthe impact of both our internal controls and the external business environment on the risk profiles of our operating groups and Corporate Services,supporting the proactive identification, assessment, management, monitoring and mitigation of risk.\\n‰BMO’s Initiative Assessment and Approval Process is used to assess, document and approve new products and services when a new business,\\nproduct or service is developed, or existing products and services are enhanced, as well as review projects which could impact the existing controlenvironment. This process supports continuous oversight of change in risk exposure by setting out specific requirements for due diligence, approva l,\\nmonitoring and reporting that apply at all levels of the organization.\\n‰Material trends, metrics and risk assessments comprising Key Risk Indicators, Issues Management andInternal Loss Data Events are integral\\ncomponents of an operational risk profile and are utilized to assess specific risk exposures in relation to BMO’s overall risk appetite.\\n‰Historical Internal Loss Data Events are recorded and maintained within the bank’s central operational risk platform. Our policies and standards\\nrequire the timely, concise and accurate reporting of events, including second line effective challenge. Root cause analysis is undertaken onmaterial events and loss data is monitored based on the bank’s risk appetite.\\n‰Operational Risk Capital Measurement : The bank’s operational risk capital is determined using the Basel III Standardized Approach (SA), which is\\na product of the Business Indicator Component (BIC) and Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM). BIC is a financial statement-based proxy representing activ ity\\nwithin the bank and ILM is a proxy representing the control environment relative to activity. ILM is a mathematical calculation based on 10-yearaverage historical losses (net of recoveries) and the three-year average BIC.\\n‰Stress Testing Scenario Analysis assesses the potential impact of severe, hypothetical but plausible scenarios covering material and emerging\\nrisks, as well as critical business processes at the bank. Results of the stress test scenarios are leveraged to derive operational loss projections t hat\\nmay be used for risk management (understanding areas of concentration, susceptibility, prioritizing incremental risk mitigation strategies, etc .) and\\nrisk measurement (understanding exposures, benchmarking, developing KRIs, controls and supporting regulatory stress submissions).\\n‰BMO’s Corporate Risk & Insurance (CR&I) group provides a second layer of mitigation for certain operational risk exposures. CR&I is also\\naccountable for establishing and maintaining the enterprise-wide insurance program. We purchase insurance when required by law, regulation orcontractual agreement, and when it is economically attractive and practicable to mitigate our risks, in order to provide adequate protection agains t\\nunexpected material loss. The policy structures and coverage provisions of our insurance positions are assessed annually to confirm alignment withBMO’s overall risk tolerance.\\n‰BMO is evolving its approach to overseeing payment risk by horizontally assessing both financial and non-financial risks, which can arise at anystage in the end-to-end life cycle of its products and services.\\nThe following are some of the operational non-financial risks that may adversely affect BMO’s business and financial results.\\nAnti-Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Risk\\nMoney laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risks are associated wi th laundering the proceeds of crime, financing terrorist activity or vi olating\\neconomic sanctions by making use of the bank’s products or services. Complia nce with applicable anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing ( AML/\\nATF) and sanctions measures is critical to safeguarding BMO, our custo mers and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to managing\\nAML/ATF and sanctions risks effectively, and to complying with releva nt laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\\nconsequences of non-compliance with these requirements include legal pr oceedings, financial losses, regulatory enforcement actions, sanctions and\\nfines, criminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or a n inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in investor and customer\\nconfidence, and damage to our reputation. Under the direction of the Chie f Anti-Money Laundering Officer (CAMLO), BMO’s enterprise AML/ATF and\\nsanctions compliance program promotes effective governance and oversi ght across all of our businesses, and sets out policies, risk assessments, du e\\ndiligence processes and controls and training, including targeted train ing and mandatory annual training for all employees. BMO’s compliance prog ram\\napplies data analytics, technology and professional expertise in order to deter, detect and report suspicious activity. BMO has implemented a\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 101\\n\\n\\n## Page 90\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nKnow-Your-Customer program which aims to understand who its customers ar e, as well as the beneficial ownership of entities holding BMO products. In\\naddition, customers and transactions are routinely screened against curre nt sanctions, terrorist and other designated watch lists. The CAMLO repo rts\\nregularly to the Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Boar d of Directors and to senior management on the effectiveness of the\\ncompliance program. The effectiveness of our AML/ATF and sanctions comp liance program is subject to regular review and independent assessment by\\nthe Corporate Audit Division. We remain committed to effective com pliance and the ongoing effort to protect the financial system.\\nArtificial Intelligence Risk\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) risk arises from the development, implementation and incorrect or biased use of AI systems, including machine learnin g\\n(ML) and generative AI system outputs, which may lead to financial loss, poor customer experiences and damage to our reputation.\\nThe AI capabilities available to the industry have been evolving at unprecedented speed, highlighting new opportunities for innovation across a\\nbroad range of products and services. AI is expected to become a key driver of future operating efficiencies, but only if we adopt and integrate newtechnologies in a safe and responsible manner. Our use of AI has the potential to pose risks to the organization that overlap existing riskmanagement frameworks (e.g., model risk). These AI risks may be exacerbated by the scale, scope and processing speed of AI, or can take novelforms. In addition, the use of AI outside of BMO can complicate the threat landscape and could impact other risk frameworks which are evolving tomeet these more complex threats.\\nOur management and oversight of AI risk, including risks arising from the use of generative AI, are consistent with our ERMF, employ our three-\\nlines-of-defence model and consider industry standard frameworks and existing regulatory requirements such as privacy laws. Significant AIinitiatives are reviewed by a cross-functional group before implementation, which considers potential risks and adverse impacts, including unfai ro r\\nbiased output from AI systems, and measures to mitigate such risks. We are focused on advancing our commitment to serving our customers in a waythat fosters confidence and trust in our fair, secure, transparent and ethical use of these technologies, utilizing our risk management practices, o ur\\nglobal privacy principles and our internal safeguards, such as oversight, monitoring and testing, to employ AI responsibly. Our approach to theresponsible use of AI, including generative AI, continues to evolve and adapt to ongoing regulatory developments in the jurisdictions in which weoperate.\\nBusiness Continuity Risk\\nBusiness continuity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to maintain, continue or restore essential business operations during and /\\nor after an event that prevents BMO from conducting business in the normal course.\\nBusiness continuity management should enable BMO to recover, maintain and manage critical processes, as well as safeguard the interests and\\nwell-being of our customers, shareholders and employees. In the event of an operational disruption, effective business continuity plans aim tominimize adverse impacts on our customers, employees and other interested parties. These operational disruptions could result from severe weather ,\\ntechnology failures, cyber attacks or any other event that can lead to process failure. We have a framework in place that facilitates the rapid recover y\\nand timely resumption of critical operations, including availability of our people, processes, facilities and technology, and maintenance of our t hird-\\nparty relationships. Our comprehensive business continuity management strategy involves developing, testing and maintaining recovery strategi es\\nand plans with the objective that critical processes and third-party relationships remain resilient throughout any disruption.\\nCyber and Information Security Risk\\nCyber and information security risk arises from the possibility that BMO’s business could be materially affected by security incidents, including t he\\nloss, theft or misuse of information, including all types of data (e.g., client data, employee data and the organization’s proprietary data), as well as\\nany potential failure to comply with rules concerning information or cyber security. We are the target of attempted cyber attacks and mustcontinuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure, as well as access to and th e\\nsecurity of our data. Any resulting data breaches may lead to exposure or loss of data, including customer or employee information and the bank’sstrategic or other sensitive internal information, and could result in identity theft, fraud or business losses. Cyber attacks could result in syste m\\nfailures and disruption of services, and expose the bank to litigation and regulatory risk, as well as reputational harm. Threat campaigns are becomi ng\\nmore sophisticated and well-organized, and often take place through third-party suppliers, which can negatively impact our business, brand andreputation, as well as customer retention and acquisition. Due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective serviceproviders), central agents, exchanges, clearing-houses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of these are subjec tt oa\\nsuccessful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the thirdparty or result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client, employee or other confidential information, which could interrupt our business an d\\nadversely affect our operations and reputation.\\nCyber and information security is critical to the delivery of the bank’s strategies, initiatives and goals. As technology evolves rapidly and the\\nconnective capabilities of digital devices continue to grow, cyber threats and risks also evolve. These threats include breaches of, or disruptions to,\\nour systems or operations, as well as unauthorized access to, or use or dissemination of, information pertaining to BMO, our customers or employees.At BMO, our response includes investing in our Financial Crimes Unit and technological infrastructure, equipping our team to detect and address cybe r\\nsecurity threats across North America, Europe and Asia. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not beable to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, as the techniques used are increasingly sophistic ated,\\nchange frequently and are often not recognized until launched. As a result of these risks, we could become subject to legal or regulatory action,reputational and operational harm, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against, or not fully covered through any insurancemaintained by BMO.\\n102 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 91\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Data and Analytics Risk\\nData and analytics risk arises from the possibility of loss or harm from the inadequate or failed identification, management, accuracy or timeliness of\\nstructured or unstructured data used to support business processes and decision-making, including analytics. Data quality, governance andarchitecture impact our understanding and management of BMO’s data assets and the data quality of analytical output.\\nWe continue to invest in new capabilities in support of BMO’s digital transformation. Our ability to effectively manage and safeguard critical data\\nhas a direct impact on our successful deployment of digital processes and our ability to develop and introduce innovative new capabilities with toolsand systems driven by AI. Our management of data and analytics risk is focused on the quality, resilience, retention and governance of BMO’s dataassets, which are foundational to our business operations, strategy and future growth, including BMO’s Digital First strategy.\\nFraud and Physical Security Risk\\nFraud risk arises from the possibility that an intentional act, misstatement or omission designed to deceive others may result in the intended targetexperiencing a loss or the perpetrator achieving a gain. Fraud may be perpetrated by our employees, suppliers or other external parties, includingBMO customers. Fraudsters continue to target the financial industry with increasingly sophisticated methods that facilitate fraud and remit funds to\\nfraudulent accounts. BMO maintains a Fraud Risk Management program intended to proactively manage fraud risks across the bank.\\nThe management of physical security risk seeks to ensure that the bank, its customers, employees and third parties are protected against the risk\\nof loss, interference, unauthorized physical access, damage or injury to which they may be exposed as a result of the bank’s operations. Physicalsecurity risks may emerge through various threat vectors, including criminal activities, terrorist attacks, sociopolitical unrest, human error, natural\\ndisasters and/or geopolitical threats. Physical security measures may also support the management of other risks, including risks related toinformation security, privacy and fraud.\\nProject and Change Management Risk\\nProject and change management risk is the risk of loss arising from the possibility that BMO could experience a loss due to substandard delivery of aninitiative that may result in the business not achieving its intended outcome, as well as attracting additional regulatory scrutiny.\\nThe bank has established a Project and Change Management Risk Framework to drive consistency in the delivery of an initiative within a\\nprescribed control environment. This framework outlines the principles and processes for providing governance, monitoring and reporting, as well as\\nthe roles and responsibilities necessary to address project and change management risk across the enterprise in order to meet or exceed theexpectations of interested parties.\\nTechnology Risk\\nTechnology risk, including risks related to emerging technology and digital platforms, is the possibility that the inadequacy, misuse, disruption or\\nfailure of information technology systems, infrastructure or data could result in an inability to meet business needs. Technology risk managementmeasures are intended to protect BMO’s systems, data and assets, and help safeguard their confidentiality, integrity and availability. As the adopt ion\\nof digital banking channels continues to grow, we continue to invest in new and innovative technological capabilities in order to meet our customers’expectations and keep their data secure. In alignment with our operational risk management framework, we follow a program that addressesexposures to technology risk, supported by a team of technology risk management experts.\\nThird-Party Risk\\nThird-party risk is the risk of loss associated with an entity failing to provide goods, business activities, functions and/or services, failing to p rotect\\ndata or systems of the bank, or exposing BMO to other negative outcomes. BMO’s third-party risk management (TPRM) framework sets therequirements for the identification, assessment, management, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of third-party risk across the third-party li fe cycle.\\nThis framework is supported by a centrally maintained TPRM program.\\nWe continue to enhance and evolve our capabilities in order to maintain robust risk management practices, support operational resilience\\nobjectives and comply with regulatory requirements.\\nFor further discussion of third-party risk, refer to the Cyber and Information Security section.\\nModel Risk\\nModel Risk is the potential for adverse outcomes resulting from decisions that are based on incorrect or misused model results. These adverse\\noutcomes can include financial loss, poor business decision-making and damage to reputation.\\nModel risk arises from the use of quantitative analytical tools that apply statistical, mathematical, economic, algorithmic or other advanced\\ntechniques, such as AI and ML, to process input data and generate quantitative output or estimates. These analytical tools range from very simplequantitative methods that produce straightforward estimates to highly sophisticated models that can be used to value complex transactions orprovide a broad range of forward-looking estimates. These analytical tools generate results that can inform business, risk and capital managementdecision-making, and assist in making daily lending, trading, underwriting, funding, investment and operational decisions.\\nThese analytical tools provide important insights and are effective when used within a framework that identifies key assumptions and\\nlimitations, while controlling and mitigating model risk. In addition to applying judgment to evaluate the reliability of model results, we mitigat e\\nmodel risk by maintaining strong controls over the development, validation, implementation and use of all models across the enterprise. We alsoseek to ensure that other analytical tools, including critical calculations and other estimation approaches, such as model overlays used for keybusiness decision-making, are intuitive, experience-based, well-documented and subject to effective challenge by employees, who have sufficien t\\nexpertise and knowledge in order to deliver reasonable results.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 103\\n\\n\\n## Page 92\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nModel Risk Management Framework\\nRisk is inherent in models because model results are estimates that rely on statistical, mathematical or other quantitative techniques to approxima te\\nreality and transform data into estimates or forecasts of future outcomes. Model risk also arises from the potential misuse of models or model results .\\nModel risk is governed at BMO by a risk-based enterprise-wide Model Risk Management Framework.\\nInitiation &\\nIdentification123 67 4Model Life Cycle\\nDevelopment Validation ImplementationUse &\\nMaintenanceOngoing\\nMonitoring\\n& ValidationDecommission5\\nThe Model Risk Management Framework sets out an end-to-end approach for model risk governance across the model life cycle and for the\\nmanagement of model risk within the limits of our risk appetite. The framework includes BMO’s Model Risk Corporate Policy, Model Risk Guidelinesand supporting operating procedures, which outline the governing principles for managing model risk, describe model risk management processes indetail and define the roles and responsibilities of interested parties across the model life cycle. Model owners, developers and users serve as the fi rst\\nline of defence, while the Model Risk Management group is the second line of defence and the Corporate Audit Division is the third line of defence.\\nOur Model Risk Management group is responsible for developing and maintaining our Model Risk Management Framework in alignment with\\nregulatory expectations, as well as for exercising oversight of the effectiveness of model processes, model inventory and the overall aggregation,assessment and reporting of model risk. This framework incorporates guidance on the management of risks, the safe and responsible adoption ofadvances in automation used for decision-making, such as large language models and algorithmic trading, as well as other AI and ML applications. Ourenterprise Model Risk Management Committee (MRMC), a sub-committee of the RMC, is a cross-functional group representing interested parties acrossthe enterprise. The MRMC meets regularly to help direct BMO’s use of models, oversee the development, implementation and maintenance of theModel Risk Management Framework, provide effective challenge and discuss governance of the enterprise’s models.\\nOutcomes Analysis and Back-TestingOnce models are validated, approved and in use, they are subject to ongoing monitoring, including outcomes analysis, at varying frequencies. As akey component of outcomes analysis, back-testing compares model results against actual observed outcomes. Variances between model forecastsand actual observed outcomes are measured against defined risk materiality thresholds and tolerance ranges, which may result in further steps beingtaken, such as model review and parameter recalibration, as appropriate. This analysis serves to confirm the validity of a model’s performance overtime. Controls are in place to address identified issues and enhance our models’ overall performance.\\nAll models used within BMO, including models that incorporate AI and ML techniques, are subject to validation and ongoing monitoring to\\nconfirm that they are being used in alignment with our framework and in compliance with regulatory expectations, such as those related to ethics,privacy, fairness and explainability. This framework applies to a wide variety of models, ranging from market, credit and non-financial risk models to\\nstress testing, pricing and valuation, and anti-money laundering models.\\nCautionThis Operational Non-Financial Risk section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Stateme nts.\\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\\nLegal and Regulatory Risk is the potential for loss or harm resulting from failure to comply with laws or satisfy contractual obligations or\\nregulatory requirements. This includes the risk arising from any failure to: comply with the law (in letter or in spirit) or maintain standards of care ;\\nimplement legal or regulatory requirements; enforce or comply with contractual terms; assert non-contractual rights; effectively manage dispute s;\\nor act in a manner so as to maintain our reputation.\\nThe success of BMO’s business operations relies in part on our ability to manage our exposure to legal and regulatory risk. The financial services\\nindustry is highly regulated and subject to strict enforcement of legal and regulatory requirements. Banks globally continue to be subject to fines a nd\\nother penalties for a number of regulatory and conduct issues. We are exposed to risks in connection with regulatory and governmental inquiries,investigations and enforcement actions, as well as criminal prosecutions. As rulemaking and supervisory expectations continue to evolve, we monit or\\ndevelopments to enable BMO to respond by implementing changes as required.\\nUnder the direction of BMO’s General Counsel, our Legal & Regulatory Compliance group maintains enterprise-wide frameworks that set out the\\nsteps to be taken to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on exposure to legal and regulatory risk. We identify applicable laws andregulations and potential risks, recommend mitigation measures and strategies, conduct internal investigations, and oversee legal proceedings a nd\\nenforcement actions, including civil claims and litigation, criminal charges, and regulatory examinations and audits.\\nHeightened regulatory and supervisory scrutiny has a significant impact on the way we conduct business. Working with the operating groups and\\nCorporate Services, Legal & Regulatory Compliance assesses and analyzes the implications of changes in regulatory and supervisory expectations. W e\\ndevote substantial resources to the implementation of systems and processes required to comply with new regulations. Failure to comply withapplicable legal and regulatory requirements may lead to legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions or fines, enforcement actions ,\\ncriminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in investor and cus tomer\\nconfidence, and damage to our reputation. Certain businesses are also subject to fiduciary requirements, including policies and practices that add ress\\nthe responsibilities of a business to a customer, such as service requirements and expectations, customer suitability determinations, disclosureobligations and communications.\\n104 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 93\\n\\n                          MD&A                          BMO is subject to legal proceedings, including investigations by regulators, arising in the ordinary course of business, and the unfavourable\\nresolution of any such legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow s,\\ncapital position or credit ratings; require material changes in our operations; result in operational restrictions or an inability to execute certa in business\\nstrategies; result in loss of customers; and damage our reputation. The volume of legal proceedings and the amount of damages and penaltiesassessed in such legal proceedings could grow in the future. Information regarding material legal proceedings to which we are a party is included inthe Legal Proceedings section in Note 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intend ed\\nto provide reasonable assurance that relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, so that appropriatedecisions can be made regarding public disclosure. In assessing the materiality of legal proceedings, factors considered include a case-by-caseassessment of specific facts and circumstances, our past experience and the opinions of legal experts. However, some legal proceedings may behighly complex, and may include novel or untested legal claims or theories. The outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to anticipate until latein the proceedings, which may last several years.\\nBMO’s Anti-Corruption Office, through its global program, has articulated key principles and procedures that support the effective oversight of\\ncompliance with anti-corruption legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These include guidance on identifying, avoiding and reporti ng on\\ncorrupt practices and rigorously investigating allegations of corrupt activity. Evolving competition or antitrust risk is managed globally throu gh BMO’s\\nCompetition/Antitrust Office, which is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of a compliance program that supports theoversight of competition/antitrust laws or regulatory expectations.\\nGovernments and regulators around the world continue to focus on anti-mon ey laundering and related concerns, raising their expectations for the\\nquality and efficacy of anti-money laundering programs and penalizing i nstitutions that fail to meet these expectations. Failure to meet these\\nexpectations may lead to legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions or fines, enforcement actions, criminal convictions and penal ties,\\noperational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business stra tegies, a decline in investor and customer confidence, and damage to our\\nreputation. Under the direction of the Chief Anti-Money Laundering Offi cer (CAMLO), BMO’s Anti-Money Laundering Office is responsible for the\\nassessment, governance and oversight of the principles and procedures th at support the effective oversight of compliance with laws and regulations\\nand internal risk parameters related to anti-money laundering, anti-terr orist financing and sanctions measures. For further discussion, refer to the\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Management – Anti-Money Lau ndering, Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Risk section.\\nBMO has built its reputation on a strong foundation of ethical business practices, a client service culture and our track record of responsible risk\\nmanagement. We have adopted a wide range of practices, in addition to BMO’s Code of Conduct, to support the ethical conduct of our employees andBoard of Directors and mitigate the risk of potential misconduct. Misconduct is behaviour that falls short of legal, professional, internal conduct and\\nethical standards. Acting with integrity and competing ethically and responsibly support our focus on maintaining a strong risk culture. For furthe r\\ndiscussion, refer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework – Risk Culture section.\\nAll of these frameworks reflect the three-lines-of-defence operating model described previously. The operating groups and Corporate Services\\nmanage day-to-day risks by implementing and monitoring corporate policies and standards, while Legal & Regulatory Compliance units specificallyassigned to each of the operating groups provide advice and independent legal and regulatory risk management oversight.\\nThe General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer regularly report to the Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Board of\\nDirectors and senior management on the effectiveness of our enterprise compliance program. The program takes a risk-based approach to identify,assess and manage any risks related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and directs operating groups and Corporate Services tomaintain policies, procedures and controls that address these laws and regulations. Under the direction of the Chief Compliance Officer, we identif y\\nand report on gaps and deficiencies, and we track remedial action plans. The CAMLO also regularly reports to the ACRC.\\nAll BMO employees must regularly complete legal and regulatory training on topics such as anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, competition/\\nantitrust and privacy policies, standards and directives. This is carried out in conjunction with our Code of Conduct training, which tests employee s’\\nknowledge and understanding of the behaviour required of BMO employees.\\nWe continue to respond to other global regulatory developments, including the impact of changes in capital and liquidity requirements. These\\ndevelopments include sustainability and climate change related developments, consumer protection measures and specific financial reforms andprivacy matters, which are discussed further below. For additional discussion of regulatory developments related to capital management and liquid ity\\nand funding risk, refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section and the Liquidity and Funding Risk section. For a discussion of the impact o f\\ncertain other regulatory developments, refer to: Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments – Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets; Risks That MayAffect Future Results – Fiscal and Monetary Policies and Other Economic Conditions in the Countries in which BMO Conducts Business; Tax Legislationand Interpretations; and Other Regulatory Developments.\\nSustainability and Climate Change Matters\\nWe continue to monitor the rulemaking activities of regulatory authorities, and we are participating in programs and consultations that focus on ris k\\nmanagement and disclosures related to sustainability matters, as well as trends in climate-related litigation. Globally, we are also tracking theemergence and finalization of formal supervisory regulatory frameworks governing the analysis and reporting of risks related to sustainability an d\\nclimate change, including frameworks in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. In addition, current and emergingregulatory requirements in certain U.S. states may apply restrictions or sanctions on financial institutions that impose any environmental standa rds\\nthat exceed the legal or regulatory requirements of the states in which they operate.

In Canada, there is continuing focus on requiring financial institutions to support mortgage holders at risk, asoutlined in the federal government’s Canadian Mortgage Charter. In addition, the government is taking steps to reduce the costs of banking, includin g\\nby lowering banking fees, through a cap on non-sufficient funds fees, which will reduce our fee revenue when implemented. Several provinces arealso enhancing protections for consumers, including such areas as consumer fraud, through legislative changes to their consumer protection regime s.\\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators adopted changes to harmonize and enhance reporting of theongoing costs, including embedded fees, of owning investment funds and segregated funds. In the United States, banking regulators have aheightened focus on matters pertaining to racial equity, financial inclusion and consumer protection, including the impact on consumers from fraud or\\nprocesses to protect consumers from fraud. Key consumer concerns, including fair lending and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, are nowsubject to heightened regulatory scrutiny in bank examination programs. In both Canada and the United States, there is a growing focus on consumerdata rights and both jurisdictions have started to introduce regulatory frameworks for open banking that will require banks to share data, aspermitted by consumers, with authorized third parties.\\nPrivacy\\nProtection of personal information is critical to maintaining the trust of our customers. Our handling of personal information is increasingly impo rtant\\nas we continue to drive our Digital First strategy. There is a growing focus on regulation related to privacy and the use and safeguarding of personalinformation, and we continue to advance our privacy program to comply with new and amended legislation where we do business. In Canada,significant reform to federal privacy laws is expected under Bill C-27, including new regulatory powers and penalties and additional legislation toaddress the use of artificial intelligence. In Quebec, Law 25 (previously Bill 64) came into effect in three phases, beginning in fiscal 2021 and endin g\\nin September 2024. Law 25 modernizes the province’s private-sector privacy regime, introduces new regulations related to biometrics and automateddecisions, and gives new powers to regulators to impose monetary administrative penalties. Outside of Canada, large fines and settlements havebeen imposed for breaches of privacy rights and failure to comply with regulatory privacy requirements – evidence of heightened regulatory vigilanc e\\nand enforcement. The California Consumer Privacy Act was enhanced and amended in 2023 by the California Privacy Rights Act , which includes new\\nand expanded privacy rights for California residents. Other states have introduced privacy legislation, which is leading to a growing patchwork ofprivacy laws in the United States. In the European Union and the United Kingdom, there are ongoing concerns regarding the transfer of personal datato countries lacking adequate privacy protection. Privacy-related risks, including risks of privacy breaches, have escalated as a result of the thr eat\\nlandscape. For further discussion, refer to the Top and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results – Cyber and Information Security Risk section an d\\nthe Operational Non-Financial Risk – Cyber and Information Security Risk section.\\nU.S. Regulatory Developments\\nThere are several pending regulatory rules that will likely impact BMO’s U.S. operations, including the following:\\n‰Capital: In July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued new rule proposals that would revise the regulatory capital framework for large bank holdingcompanies and their depository institutions, including BMO Financial Corp. (BFC), BMO’s U.S. holding company, and BMO Bank N.A. These proposalswould implement the risk-based capital standards contained in the Basel III Reforms (referred to as Basel III Endgame) published by the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision. On September 10, 2024, the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the proposed rules will be revised andre-issued as a new proposal.\\n‰Long-term debt: In August 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a new rule proposal that would require large banks with total assetsof $100 billion or more to maintain a layer of long-term debt, which would improve financial stability by increasing the resolvability and resilienceof such institutions.\\nThe impact of these proposed rules on our results will depend on the final rules issued by the U.S. banking agencies. We currently do not expect a\\nmaterial change to our enterprise-level funding activities if these rules are enacted as proposed.\\nBFC is regulated as a Category III firm under the Enhanced Prudential Standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Additional information\\nregarding regulatory requirements that apply to BFC is set out in the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section.\\nCautionThis Legal and Regulatory Risk section contains forward-looking statements.

The impact of this risk can be limited through an effective strategic risk management framework and stress testing.\\nBMO’s Corporate Strategy group oversees the strategic planning process and works with the lines of business and Corporate Services to identify,\\nmonitor and mitigate risks across the enterprise. Our rigorous strategic risk management framework encourages a consistent approach in thedevelopment of strategic plans through an integrated, multi-year strategic and financial planning process, in alignment with our enterprise riskappetite.\\nThe framework promotes consistency and adherence to management standards, including a consideration of the results of stress testing as an\\ninput into our decision-making. The potential impacts of changes in the business environment, including macroeconomic developments, broadindustry trends, the actions of existing and new competitors and regulatory developments, are considered in this process and inform decision-makin g\\nwithin each line of business. Oversight of strategic risk is the responsibility of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. This is carried out\\nthrough an annual review of enterprise and operating group strategies, which involves interactive sessions that challenge assumptions and thestrategies in the context of both the current and potential future business environment. Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management reviews businessstrategies to confirm that they are developed and executed in accordance with the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework and are within ourestablished risk appetite, tolerances and limits. Where required, these strategies are revised to address new or unexpected developments.\\nStrategic risk also includes business risk arising from specific enterprise activities and the effects these could have on earnings. Within BMO, eac h\\noperating group is responsible for controlling its respective business risk by assessing, managing and mitigating risks. To manage exposure totransverse business risks (i.e., those spanning multiple lines of business, such as climate change), the Corporate Strategy group works in tandem wi th\\nthe relevant business partners to shape effective mitigation approaches.\\nOur ability to implement the strategic plans developed by management influences our financial performance. Performance objectives are\\nestablished through the strategic planning process and our progress toward those objectives is monitored regularly and reported on quarterly, usin g\\nboth leading and lagging indicators of absolute and relative performance, so that strategies can be reviewed and adjusted where necessary. Regularstrategic and financial updates are also reviewed closely in order to identify any significant emerging risk issues.\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk is the potential for loss or harm directly or indirectly resulting from environmental and social factors that impact\\nBMO or its customers, and BMO’s impact on the environment and society.\\nIn recognition of its unique characteristics, environmental and social (E&S) risk is classified in BMO’s Risk Taxonomy as a transverse risk that may\\nmanifest itself through other risk types, namely credit and counterparty risk, market risk, insurance risk, liquidity and funding risk, operationa l\\nnon-financial risk, legal and regulatory risk, strategic risk and reputation risk. E&S risk may arise over a range of time frames, from short-term tolong-term. Factors that may give rise to E&S risk include, but are not limited to: climate change; pollution and waste; the use of energy, water andother resources; biodiversity and land use; human rights; diversity, equity and inclusion; labour standards; community health, safety and securit y; land\\nacquisition and involuntary resettlement; Indigenous peoples’ rights; and cultural heritage. We are advancing our risk identification efforts by defining\\nthese factors and identifying any risk exposures that may be affected by the transverse impact of these factors.\\nWe recognize that climate change involves exposure to physical and transition risks. Physical risks are associated with a changing climate, which\\ncan have both acute and chronic physical effects. These risks may include an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather-related events, suchas storms, floods, wildfires and heatwaves, or longer-term changes, such as temperature changes, rising sea levels and changes in soil productivity .\\nTo date, key climate change indicators, weather-related events and associated scientific research indicate that global exposure to climate change risks\\nappears to be accelerating. Transition risks are associated with the shift to a net zero carbon economy. These risks may arise from climate-relatedpolicy changes, technological changes and behavioural changes involving carbon-pricing mechanisms, or a shift in consumer preferences towardlower-carbon products and services. We continue to closely monitor these changes, some of which may unfold more rapidly than others asconsumers, clients, investors, governments and communities act to enhance their resilience to climate-related risks.\\nWe may have direct exposure to E&S risk associated with the ownership and operation of BMO’s businesses. We may be indirectly exposed to the\\nrisk of financial loss or reputational harm if our customers or suppliers are affected by E&S factors or are associated with adverse environmental orsocial impacts to such an extent that they are unable to meet their financial or other obligations to us, or cause reputational risks for BMO. E&S factor s\\nmay also give rise to the risk of reputational harm if we are perceived to not respond effectively to those factors, or to cause, contribute or be linkedto adverse impacts on the environment or society, as discussed in the Reputation Risk section.\\nGovernance\\nThe Board of Directors, through the Risk Review Committee (RRC), approves the E&S Risk Appetite Statement and the E&S Risk Corporate Policy, asdiscussed below. The RRC assists the Board of Directors in meeting its oversight responsibilities for the identification, assessment and managemen to f\\nour exposure to E&S risk, including risks arising from climate change, for the overall adherence to risk management corporate policies, and forcomplying with risk-related regulatory requirements. The Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) assesses the effectiveness of BMO’sgovernance of sustainability matters and approves BMO’s sustainability reporting and disclosures, including our Sustainability Report and Publi c\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 107\\n\\n\\n## Page 96\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAccountability Statement, and our Climate Report. The Human Resources Committee has responsibility for the alignment of executive compensation\\nwith performance, including performance in relation to BMO’s environmental and social objectives. The Governance and Nominating Committeeregularly reviews the charters of our Board of Directors and its committees to assess the coverage and alignment of their responsibilities foroverseeing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues with their respective mandates.\\nBMO’s General Counsel is the bank’s Executive Committee Sponsor for Sustainability and Climate, and has accountability for legal and regulatory\\nrisk, reputation risk, business conduct and ethics, and sustainability, including climate change. Our ESG Executive Committee comprises executiv e\\ncommittee members from the lines of business and Corporate Services, and provides oversight and leadership for our sustainability strategy,including our Climate Ambition. In addition to the ESG Executive Committee, BMO has a Sustainability Council which acts as a leadership forum foradvancing sustainability initiatives. Senior management oversees E&S risk through management committees and forums that provide oversight andreceive updates on sustainability matters and E&S risk. These include, but are not limited to: Disclosure Committee, Risk Management Committee(RMC), Reputation Risk Management Committee (RRMC), Enterprise Regulatory Committee, Climate Commercialization Working Group and ImpactInvestment Fund Committee, as well as the Investment Committee of BMO Global Asset Management. Additional committees, forums and workinggroups may be established as needed. In addition, the Board of Directors and any management committees active in other jurisdictions receiveupdates and oversee E&S risk for the relevant jurisdiction. They also receive updates on sustainability matters and E&S risk across the enterprise.\\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO), as Head of Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM), and supported by the Risk Executive Committee, acts\\nas the second line of defence on the transverse impacts of E&S risk on credit and counterparty risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, insurancerisk and operational non-financial risk; oversees risk appetite for E&S risk in the context of these risks; and reports to the Board of Directors, its R RC\\nand the RMC on E&S risk.\\nStrategy\\nOur climate ambition is to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world. This ambition is explicitly linked to our enterprisecommercial strategy, and we are working to realize this ambition through a four-pillar climate strategy: Commitment; Capabilities; Client partner ship\\nand commercialization; and Convening for climate action. Our strategy seeks to capture commercialization opportunities by working with our client s\\non their decarbonization journeys. The strategy is being implemented by our operating groups, overseen by the ESG Executive Committee andsupported by the BMO Climate Institute, which serves as an enterprise resource to accelerate BMO’s climate-related transition efforts and as aninternal and external convenor on climate action.\\nIn order to remain informed about emerging E&S risks, we participate in global forums with other financial institutions and maintain an open\\ndialogue with other external parties.\\nE&S Risk Management\\nA successful future for BMO and our customers depends on the sustainability of the environment, communities and economies in which we operate.We seek to understand the impact that E&S risk factors could have on our business environment, as well as on our clients, portfolios and operations.With this understanding, we are better positioned to make informed strategic decisions.\\nOur E&S Risk Corporate Policy, applicable to all BMO employees, sets out our approach to integrating E&S risk into the Enterprise-Wide Risk\\nManagement Framework (ERMF). The policy affirms the expectation of our Board of Directors that BMO will integrate considerations of E&S risk acrossthe ERMF, including risks arising from climate change. It is supported by BMO’s three-lines-of-defence operating model and is underpinned by our ris k\\nculture. Its implementation involves building new capabilities, while also leveraging our existing risk governance provisions and resources, to i dentify,\\nassess, manage, monitor and report on potential impacts on our clients, portfolios and operations. The E&S Risk Corporate Policy is complemented bytwo enterprise-wide policy documents: a Climate Risk Corporate Standard to enable effective climate risk management and support legal andregulatory compliance, and an E&S Risk Management Framework Directive, which supports implementation of the corporate policy.\\nWe have developed a qualitative Risk Appetite Statement that includes E&S risks, including risks related to climate change. In addition, we have\\nenhanced a transition key risk metric with risk tolerance thresholds, which measures our credit risk exposure in support of carbon-related assets as a\\npercentage of our total credit risk exposure. In parallel, we have also included a key risk indicator to quantify BMO’s exposure to physical risks offlooding, and will continue to expand and enhance these key risk metrics and indicators as appropriate to monitor climate risk concentrations.\\nE&S risk is also addressed in our Credit Risk Management Framework, including provisions for governance and accountabilities, enhanced due\\ndiligence and thresholds for escalations or exceptions. Sector-specific financing guidelines help us identify and manage exposure to E&S risk in hi gher-\\nrisk sectors and integrate consideration of these risks into our decision-making, which also considers factors such as climate change and Indigenou s\\nconsultation. The E&S Risk General Financing Guideline is an enterprise-level second-line directive that applies to wholesale lending transactio ns;\\narticulates our lending risk appetite for E&S risk, outlines the enhanced due diligence process, supported by E&S Risk Rating (ESRR) assessment tool s\\ndeveloped to address sectors with heightened risk and outlines lending considerations, escalations and elevations. The E&S Risk General FinancingGuideline includes direction on developing an understanding of the specific impacts of climate change on borrowers and their operations, includingregulatory and/or legislative changes.\\nWe maintain a diversified lending portfolio to limit our exposure to any one sector or geographic region that might be vulnerable to climate-\\nrelated risk, and we continue to conduct sector-specific reviews across our lending portfolio to assess exposure to climate-sensitive industries. Social\\nand environmental requirements in financing arrangements and transactions are monitored by the lines of business as part of our overall monitoringprocess. Transactions involving significant environmental or social concerns may be escalated to the RRMC for consideration.\\nWe are continuing to develop our climate scenario analysis program to explore climate-specific vulnerabilities and enhance our resilience to\\nclimate-related risks, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The climate scenario an alysis\\nprogram leverages existing risk capabilities in combination with climate-specific expertise, tools and data. This program includes the evaluatio no f\\ntransition risks and physical risks through comprehensive climate-based scenarios across portfolios and risk types, and also considers integrati on of\\nscenario impacts at the enterprise level. This capability enables the bank to execute on regulatory scenario analysis, such as the Standardized Clim ate\\n108 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 97\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Scenario Exercise from OSFI. These analyses help to identify potential exposures and concentrations to short-, medium- and long-term climate risks\\nand may inform our business strategy in relation to climate change going forward. For example, we have identified the channels through whichclimate risk manifests itself in credit, market, operational, liquidity and insurance risk. In addition, we have developed an integrated loss asses sment\\napproach for incorporating climate risk within the bank’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\\nWe continue to assess the credibility, reliability, comparability and decision-making usefulness of various measurement, assessment and\\nreporting approaches, as well as the ways in which we could incorporate them into our climate risk management program and associated disclosures.\\nManaging E&S Risk in the Supply Chain\\nOur Sustainability group partners with the Procurement and Corporate Real Estate groups on operational sustainability. Together, these groups areresponsible for establishing and maintaining an operational environmental management approach, including the application of the framework set ou t\\nin ISO 14001 across our essential facilities, and for setting objectives and targets that are intended to align our operations with our sustainabilit y\\nperformance goals.\\nBMO’s Code of Conduct has been approved by our Board of Directors, and reflects our commitment to manage our business responsibly. We\\nreport publicly under the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 2015 , the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 and Canada’s Fighting Against Forced\\nLabour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act , and we have in place a Supplier Code of Conduct which outlines our standards for integrity, fair dealing\\nand sustainability. We require our suppliers to be aware of, understand and comply with the principles of our Supplier Code of Conduct.\\nBMO’s disclosures will be updated to meet any evolution in the expectations of pertinent legislation, in accordance with applicable timelines.\\nRegulatory Developments\\nE&S-related regulations, frameworks and guidance are rapidly evolving and we continue to monitor such developments, updating our riskmanagement practices and disclosures as necessary.\\nIn March 2024, OSFI released updates to Guideline B-15, Climate Risk Management to align with the International Sustainability Standards\\nBoard’s final IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures , standard. We incorporated these updates into our implementation plans for the first set of\\ndisclosures, effective the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after the fiscal year-end, as well a s\\nthe second phase of disclosure requirements that will be effective the fiscal year ending October 31, 2025.\\nWe are also assessing the impact of the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires disclosure across\\nvarious sustainability topics, as detailed in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards.\\nMetrics and Targets\\nOur reporting on climate-related metrics and targets includes a discussion of BMO’s Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, calculated usingthe GHG Protocol, and a discussion of our Scope 3 emissions, calculated using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). More detaileddiscussion, as well as a discussion of financed emissions targets for certain sectors, can be found in the Climate Report. The BMO Sustainability Repo rt\\nand Climate Report contain metrics, including the tracking of sustainable finance, which are relevant for sustainability purposes but may not bedirectly related to net zero goals or emissions reductions outcomes. The shareholders’ auditors provide a limited assurance report on selectedenvironmental and social indicators in the Sustainability Report and Climate Report.\\nCautionThis Environmental and Social Risk section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statement s.\\nReputation Risk\\nReputation Risk is the potential for loss or harm to the BMO brand. It can arise even if other risks are managed effectively.\\nOur reputation is built on our commitment to high standards of business conduct and is one of our most valuable assets. By protecting and\\nmaintaining our reputation, we safeguard our brand, increase shareholder value, reduce our cost of capital, improve employee engagement andpreserve our customers’ loyalty and trust.\\nWe manage risks to our reputation by considering the potential reputational impact of all business activities, including strategy development and\\nimplementation, transactions and initiatives, data and technology use (including artificial intelligence), product and service offerings, and e vents or\\nincidents impacting BMO, as well as day-to-day decision-making and conduct. We consider our reputation in everything that we do.\\nBMO’s Code of Conduct is the foundation of our ethical culture, and it provides employees with guidance on the behaviour that is expected of\\nthem, so that they can make the right choice when making a decision. Ongoing reinforcement of the commitments set out in the Code of Conductminimizes risks to our reputation that may result from inappropriate behaviour or poor decision-making. Recognizing that non-financial risks can h ave\\na negative impact as significant as the effect of financial risks, we actively promote a culture in which employees are encouraged to raise concernsand are supported in doing so, with zero tolerance for retaliation.\\nIn our corporate governance practices and Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework, we have specific controls in place to manage risks to\\nour reputation. We seek to identify activities or events that could impact our reputation with customers, regulators or other interested parties. Wh ere\\nwe identify a potential risk to our reputation, we take steps to assess and manage that risk. Instances of significant or heightened exposure toreputation risk are escalated to BMO’s Reputation Risk Management Committee (RRMC) for review. As misconduct can impact our reputation, theChief Ethics Officer, who is responsible for enterprise-wide reporting on employee conduct, may escalate instances of misconduct involving signif icant\\nreputation risk to BMO’s RRMC for review, as appropriate.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 109\\n\\n\\n## Page 98\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAccounting Matters and Disclosure and Internal Control\\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\\nThe most significant assets and liabilities for which we must make estimates and judgments include: allowance for credit losses; financial instrume nts\\nmeasured at fair value; pension and other employee future benefits; impairment of securities and investments in associates and joint ventures;income taxes and deferred tax assets; goodwill and intangible assets; insurance contract liabilities; provisions, including legal proceedings an d\\nrestructuring charges; transfers of financial assets; consolidation of structured entities (SEs); and valuation of the Bank of the West assets acqu ired and\\nliabilities assumed. We make judgments in assessing the business model for financial assets, as well as whether substantially all risks and rewardshave been transferred in respect of transfers of financial assets and whether we control structured entities. These judgments are discussed in Notes 6\\nand 7 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements. Note 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements provides furtherdetails on the estimates and judgments made in determining the fair value of financial instruments. If actual results were to differ from theseestimates, the impact would be recorded in future periods.\\nBy their nature, the judgments and estimates that we make for the purposes of preparing financial statements relate to matters that are\\ninherently uncertain. However, we have detailed policies and control procedures in place that are intended to ensure the judgments made inestimating these amounts are well-controlled, independently reviewed and consistently applied from period to period. We believe that the estimate s\\nof the values of our assets and liabilities are appropriate.\\nFor a more detailed discussion of the use of estimates, refer to Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\nThe allowance for credit losses primarily consists of allowances for impaired loans and allowances for performing loans. Our approach to establishi ng\\nand maintaining the allowance on performing loans is based on the requirements of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), and considering the\\nguideline issued by OSFI. Under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) methodology, an allowance is recorded for expected credit losses on financialassets, regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. In particular, the ECL requirements of IFRS 9 incorporate the following elementsthat are subject to a high level of judgment: measuring 12-month and lifetime credit losses; determining when a significant increase in credit risk ha s\\noccurred; forecasting forward-looking information for multiple scenarios and determining the probability weighting of each scenario; and applic ation\\nof experienced credit judgment.\\nECL is calculated on a probability-weighted basis, based on four economic scenarios, and is calculated for each exposure in the portfolio as a\\nfunction of the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD), with the timing of the loss also considered. Wherethere has been a significant increase in credit risk, lifetime ECL is recorded; otherwise, 12 months of ECL is generally recorded. The determination o fa\\nsignificant increase in credit risk requires consideration of many different factors that will vary by product and risk segment. The main factorsconsidered in making this determination are the change in PD since origination and certain other criteria, such as 30-day past due and watchliststatus. We may apply experienced credit judgment to reflect factors not captured in the results produced by the ECL models, as we deem necessary.We apply experienced credit judgment to reflect the impact of the uncertain environment on credit conditions and the economy. We have controlsand processes in place to govern the ECL process, including judgments and assumptions used in determining the allowance on performing loans.These judgments and assumptions will change over time, and the impact of any such change will be recorded in future periods.\\nIn establishing our allowance on performing loans, we attach probability weightings to economic scenarios, which are representative of our view\\nof economic and market conditions. In fiscal 2024, we added a fourth scenario to reflect a less severe downside, allowing us to expand the range ofeconomic forecasts used in the allowance estimation. The base scenario represents our view of the most probable outcome, as well as upside,downside and severe downside scenarios, and are all developed by our Economics group.\\nThe allowance on performing loans is sensitive to changes in economic forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each forecast scenario.\\nWhen changes in economic performance in the forecasts are measured, we use real GDP as the basis, which acts as the key driver for movements inmany of the other economic and market variables used, including the equity volatility index (VIX), corporate BBB credit spreads, unemployment rates ,\\nhousing price indices and consumer credit. We also consider industry-specific variables, where applicable. Many of the variables have a high degree of\\ninterdependency, and as such, there is no single factor to which the allowances as a whole are sensitive. Holding all else constant, as economicvariables worsen, the allowance on performing loans would increase and conversely, as they improve, the allowance would decrease. In addition,assuming all variables are held constant, an increase in loan balances or a deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio would each drive a n\\nincrease in the allowance on performing loans.\\nInformation on the provision for credit losses for the years ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 can be found in the Total Provision for Credit Losses\\nsection. Additional information on the process and methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses can be found in the discussion ofCredit and Counterparty Risk, as well as in Note 4 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\\nWe record assets and liabilities classified as held for trading, assets and liabilities designated at fair value, derivatives, certain equity and de bt\\nsecurities and securities sold but not yet purchased at fair value. Fair value represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset orpaid on the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between willing parties at the measurement date. We employ a fair value hierarchy basedon inputs we use in valuation techniques to measure the fair value of our financial instruments. The extent of our use of quoted market prices(Level 1), internal models with observable market information (Level 2) and internal models without observable market information (Level 3) in thevaluation of loans, securities, derivatives, certain other assets and liabilities recorded at fair value as at October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 i s\\n110 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 99', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 13, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667380', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 99\\n\\n                          MD&A                          disclosed in Note 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.

It meets at least monthly to address the more challenging valuation issues related to\\nour portfolios, approves valuation methodology changes as needed to enhance the reliability of our fair value estimates, and is a key forum for thediscussion of sources of valuation uncertainty and how these have been addressed by management. Certain financial instruments, including corporat e\\nequities, are valued by the respective business groups. Senior management oversees our valuation processes through various valuation and riskcommittees.\\nAs at October 31, 2024, total valuation adjustments were a net decrease in value of $268 million for financial instruments carried at fair value on\\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet (net decrease of $135 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nPension and Other Employee Future Benefits\\nOur pension and other employee future benefits expense is calculated by independent actuaries using assumptions determined by management.Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used are recognized in other comprehensive income.\\nPension and other employee future benefits expense, plan assets and defined benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in discount rates. We\\ndetermine discount rates at each year-end for all plans, using high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans’ specific cash flows.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for pension and other employee future benefits, including a sensitivity analysis for key assumptions ,\\nis included in Note 22 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nImpairment of Securities and Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\\nDebt securities measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are assessed for impairment using theexpected credit loss model. For securities determined to have low credit risk, the allowance for credit losses is measured with an amount equalto 12-month expected credit loss.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for debt securities measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, other securities, the related allowance for\\ncredit losses and the determination of fair value is included in Notes 3 and 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nWe review our investments in associates and joint ventures, included within other assets, at each quarter-end reporting period in order to\\nidentify and evaluate any investments that show indications of possible impairment. For these investments, a significant or prolonged decline in fa ir\\nvalue to an amount below cost is objective evidence of impairment.\\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\\nOur approach to tax matters is guided by our Statement on Tax Principles, elements of which are described below, and governed by our tax riskmanagement framework, which is implemented through internal controls and processes. We operate with due regard to risks, including tax andreputation risks. We actively seek to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report any tax risks that may arise in order to understand our financialexposure to those risks. Our intention is to comply fully with tax laws. We consider all applicable laws in connection with our commercial activities,and where tax laws change in our business or for our customers, we adapt and make adjustments accordingly. We monitor applicable tax-relateddevelopments, including legislative proposals, case law and guidance from tax authorities. When an interpretation or application of tax laws is notclear, we take well-reasoned positions based on available case law and administrative positions of tax authorities, and we engage external advisorswhen necessary. We do not engage in tax planning that does not have commercial substance, and we do not knowingly work with customers webelieve use tax strategies to evade taxes. We are committed to maintaining productive relationships and cooperating with tax authorities on all taxmatters. We seek to resolve disputes in a collaborative manner; however, when our interpretation of tax law differs from that of tax authorities, weare prepared to defend our position.\\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in either the Consolidated Statement\\nof Income, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. In determining the provisionfor income taxes, we interpret tax legislation, case law and administrative positions in numerous jurisdictions and, based on our judgment, we recor d\\nthe estimate of the amount required to settle tax obligations. We also make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred taxassets and liabilities. If the interpretations and assumptions differ from those of tax authorities or if the timing of reversals is not as expected, t he\\nprovision for income taxes could increase or decrease in future periods. The amount of any such increase or decrease cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which\\ndeductible temporary differences or unused tax losses and tax credits may be utilized. We are required to assess whether it is probable that deferredincome tax assets will be realized. Factors used to assess the probability of realization are past experience of income and capital gains, forecasts o f\\nfuture net income before taxes, and the remaining expiration period of tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. Changes in our assessment of thesefactors could increase or decrease the provision for income taxes in future periods.\\nCanadian tax authorities have reassessed us for additional income tax and interest in an amount of approximately $1,465 million in respect of\\ncertain 2011-2018 Canadian corporate dividends. These reassessments denied certain dividend deductions on the basis that the dividends were\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 111\\n\\n\\n## Page 100\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nreceived as part of a “dividend rental arrangement”. In general, the tax rules raised by Canadian tax authorities were prospectively addressed in\\nthe 2015 and 2018 Canadian federal budgets. We filed Notices of Appeal with the Tax Court of Canada and the matter is in litigation. We remain ofthe view that our tax filing positions were appropriate and intend to challenge all reassessments. However, if such challenges are unsuccessful, theadditional expense would negatively impact net income.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for income taxes is included in Note 23 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. This assessment includes a comparison of the carrying value and the recoverable amount ofeach of our cash-generating units (CGUs) in order to verify that the recoverable amount of each CGU is greater than its carrying value. If the carryingvalue of a CGU were to exceed its recoverable amount, an impairment calculation would be performed. The recoverable amount of a CGU is thehigher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\\nFair value less costs to sell has been used to perform the impairment test in all periods. In determining fair value less costs to sell, we employ a\\ndiscounted cash flow model, consistent with that used when a business is acquired. This model is dependent on assumptions related to revenuegrowth, discount rates, synergies achieved on acquisition and the availability of comparable acquisition data. Changes in any of these assumptionswould affect the determination of fair value for each of our CGUs in a different manner. Management must exercise judgment and make assumptionsin determining fair value. Differences in judgments and assumptions could affect the determination of fair value and any resulting impairmentwrite-down.\\nAs at October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, no goodwill impairment was recorded, as the estimated fair value of the CGUs was greater than\\ntheir carrying value.\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized to income on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over a period not exceeding\\n15 years, depending on the nature of the asset. We test intangible assets with definite lives for impairment when circumstances indicate thatthe carrying value may not be recoverable.\\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment. If an intangible asset is determined to be impaired, it will be written\\ndown to its recoverable amount, the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, when this is less than the carrying value.\\nAdditional information regarding the composition of goodwill and intangible assets is included in Note 11 of the audited annual consolidated\\nfinancial statements.\\nInsurance Contract Liabilities\\nInsurance contract liabilities represent estimates of fulfillment cash flows, which include a risk adjustment, and the contractual service margin (CSM).\\nFulfillment cash flows include estimates of future cash flows related to the remaining coverage period and for previously incurred claims, which arethen discounted and probability weighted. This is based on non-financial risk assumptions including mortality, policy lapses and expenses, which a re\\nbased on a combination of industry and entity specific data, and in the case of expenses, on historical analysis of which expenses are attributable toinsurance operations. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect actual experience and market conditions. In addition ,\\nwe add a risk adjustment for non-financial risk to bring the confidence level on the sufficiency of reserves to 70%-80%. The CSM is a component ofthe liability representing the unearned profit we recognize as we provide services.\\nAdditional information on insurance contract liabilities is provided in Note 15 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements, and\\ninformation on insurance risk is provided in the Insurance Risk section and the Insurance Market Risk section.\\nProvisions\\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, we have a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it isprobable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the amountrequired to settle any obligation as at the balance sheet date, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. For example, BMOand its subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions in the normal course of business. Factors considered in estimating any obligation related to\\nthese legal actions include a case-by-case assessment of specific facts and circumstances, past experience and the opinions of legal experts.Management and internal and external experts are involved in estimating any amounts that may be required. Certain provisions also relate torestructuring initiatives that we have undertaken. These provisions are recorded at management’s best estimate of the amounts that will ultimatelybe paid out.\\nThe actual costs of settling some obligations may be substantially higher or lower than the amount of the provisions.Additional information regarding provisions is included in the Legal and Regulatory Risk section and in Note 25 of the audited annual\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nTransfers of Financial Assets\\nWe sell Canadian residential and commercial mortgages to third-party Canadian securitization programs, including the Canada Mortgage BondProgram, and directly to third-party investors under the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities program.\\nWe also purchase or originate certain commercial mortgage loans that are subsequently sold and derecognized, and we purchase U.S.\\ngovernment agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) issued by third-party sponsored vehicles, which we may further securitize byrepackaging them into new CMOs prior to selling to third-party investors.\\nWe assess whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of, or control over, the assets have been transferred in order to determine if they\\nqualify for derecognition. Where we continue to be exposed to substantially all of the prepayment, interest rate and/or credit risk associated with t he\\nsecuritized assets, they do not qualify for derecognition. We continue to recognize these financial instruments, and recognize the related cashproceeds as a secured financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n112 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 101\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Consolidation of Structured Entities\\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into arrangements with SEs as described in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section. We are required\\nto consolidate a SE if we control the SE. We control a SE when we have power over the SE, exposure or rights to variable returns as a result of ourinvolvement, and the ability to exercise power to affect the amount of those returns. For certain SEs, we exercise judgment in determining whetherwe control the entity.\\nAdditional information concerning our interests in SEs is included in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section, as well as in Note 7 of the\\naudited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition of Bank of the West – Valuation of Assets and Liabilities\\nSignificant judgments and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the Bank of the West assets acquired and liabilities assumed,including the loan portfolio, core deposit and other relationship intangible assets and fixed-maturity deposits.\\nAdditional information regarding the accounting for this acquisition is included in Notes 4 and 10 of the audited annual consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\nCautionThis Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section contains forward-looking statements.

Upon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for the\\nmeasurement of investment properties, included in insurance-related assets in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, from cost to fairvalue. These changes were applied retrospectively to our fiscal 2023 results.\\nFurther details can be found in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nIFRS 9, Financial Instruments\\nEffective November 1, 2023, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy to account for regular way contracts to buy or sell financial assets on the\\ntrade date, instead of on the settlement date, and applied this change retrospectively.\\nIAS 12, Income Taxes\\nEffective November 1, 2023, we adopted an amendment to IAS 12, Income Taxes (IAS 12), which narrows the IAS 12 exemption to exclude\\ntransactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.\\nFurther details can be found in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nFuture Changes in Accounting Policies\\nIFRS 9, Financial Instruments\\nIn May 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), which introduce\\nadditional guidance in two areas. The first relates to financial assets with contingent features and when these features can be considered consisten t\\nwith a basic lending arrangement, in which case the instrument can be measured at amortized cost. The second relates to the timing of derecognitionof financial liabilities when payment takes place through an electronic payment system and certain conditions are met. These amendments will beeffective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of these amendments on our consolidated financialstatements.\\nIAS 12, Income Taxes\\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 12. The amendment addresses concerns around accounting for the global minimum top-up tax, as\\noutlined in the two-pillar plan for international tax reform developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/G20 Inclusiv e\\nFramework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. The amendment to IAS 12 includes temporary mandatory relief from recognizing and disclosingdeferred taxes related to the top-up tax. We have applied the temporary mandatory relief related to deferred taxes in jurisdictions in which weoperate where the top-up tax legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted. The global minimum tax rules will be effective for our fiscal yearbeginning November 1, 2024, and as a result, we expect an increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 of up to 65 basis points.\\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\\nIn April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18), which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\\nFinancial Statements , and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2027. IFRS 18 changes how information is grouped and\\npresented in the financial statements, and requires that certain management performance measures be included in the financial statements. We arecurrently assessing the impact of the standard on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\\nCautionThis Future Changes in Accounting Policies section contains forward-looking statements.

Beginning January 1, 2024, we no longer report this revenue related tocertain Canadian dividends on a taxable equivalent basis in BMO Capital Markets.\\nIn addition, the legislation included the Global Minimum Tax Act , which introduced a 15% global minimum tax on income earned by large\\nmultinational groups and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2024, as noted in the Future Changes in Accounting Policies –IAS 12, Income Taxes section.\\nU.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Assessment\\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) approved the final rule to implement the special assessment on depository\\ninstitutions to recover the losses incurred in the deposit insurance fund that were attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors of Silico n\\nValley Bank and Signature Bank. BMO recorded a $357 million ($476 million pre-tax) charge related to the FDIC special assessment in fiscal 2024. Weexpect further refinements of the amount of the special assessment in subsequent periods as the FDIC has greater visibility of the final loss amounts.\\nInterbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform\\nBMO has transitioned all exposure to Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) settings to alternative reference rates as at October 31, 2024.

The audit report states in its conclus ion\\nthat, in KPMG’s opinion, BMO maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at October 31, 2024, inaccordance with the criteria established in the 2013 COSO Framework.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended October 31, 2024 which materially affected, or arereasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n116 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 105\\n\\n         Supplemental Information         Supplemental Information\\nTen-Year Statistical Review\\nTABLE 64\\n($ millions)\\nAs at or for the year ended October 31 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015\\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet\\nAssetsCash and cash equivalents 65,098 77,934 87,466 93,261 57,408 48,803 42,142 32,599 31,653 40,295\\nInterest bearing deposits with banks 3,640 4,109 5,677 8,303 9,035 7,987 8,305 6,490 4,449 7,382\\nSecurities 396,880 320,084 272,551 232,849 234,260 189,438 180,935 163,198 149,985 130,918\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements 110,907 115,662 113,194 107,382 111,878 104,004 85,051 75,047 66,646 68,066\\nLoans, net of allowances 678,016 656,665 551,814 458,262 447,420 426,984 384,172 358,507 357,518 321,531\\nOther 155,106 172,552 142,695 88,118 89,260 74,979 72,688 73,763 77,709 73,689\\nTotal assets 1,409,647 1,347,006 1,173,397 988,175 949,261 852,195 773,293 709,604 687,960 641,881\\nLiabilities\\nDeposits 982,440 910,879 776,547 685,631 659,034 568,143 520,928 479,792 470,281 438,169\\nOther 334,544 351,776 317,662 238,128 225,218 225,981 199,862 180,438 170,910 159,383\\nSubordinated debt 8,377 8,228 8,150 6,893 8,416 6,995 6,782 5,029 4,439 4,416\\nTotal liabilities 1,325,361 1,270,883 1,102,359 930,652 892,668 801,119 727,572 665,259 645,630 601,968\\nTotal equity 84,286 76,123 71,038 57,523 56,593 51,076 45,721 44,345 42,330 39,913\\nTotal liabilities and equity 1,409,647 1,347,006 1,173,397 988,175 949,261 852,195 773,293 709,604 687,960 641,881\\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Income\\nNet interest income 19,468 18,681 15,885 14,310 13,971 12,888 11,438 11,275 10,945 9,796\\nNon-interest revenue 13,327 10,578 17,825 12,876 11,215 12,595 11,467 10,832 10,015 9,593\\nTotal revenue 32,795 29,259 33,710 27,186 25,186 25,483 22,905 22,107 20,960 19,389\\nInsurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit\\nliabilities (CCPB)\\n(1) – – (683) 1,399 1,708 2,709 1,352 1,538 1,543 1,254\\nProvision for credit losses (PCL) 3,761 2,178 313 20 2,953 872 662 746 771 544\\nNon-interest expense 19,499 21,134 16,194 15,509 14,177 14,630 13,477 13,192 12,916 12,250\\nIncome before income taxes 9,535 5,947 17,886 10,258 6,348 7,272 7,414 6,631 5,730 5,341\\nProvision for income taxes 2,208 1,510 4,349 2,504 1,251 1,514 1,961 1,292 1,100 936\\nNet income 7,327 4,437 13,537 7,754 5,097 5,758 5,453 5,339 4,630 4,405\\nNet income available to common shareholders 6,932 4,094 13,306 7,510 4,850 5,547 5,269 5,153 4,471 4,253\\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\\nPreferred shares and other equity instruments 8,087 6,958 6,308 5,558 6,598 5,348 4,340 4,240 3,840 3,240\\nCommon shares 23,921 22,941 17,744 13,599 13,430 12,971 12,929 13,032 12,539 12,313\\nContributed surplus 354 328 317 313 302 303 300 307 294 299\\nRetained earnings 46,469 44,006 45,117 35,497 30,745 28,725 25,850 23,700 21,207 18,930\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 5,419 1,862 1,552 2,556 5,518 3,729 2,302 3,066 4,426 4,640\\nNon-controlling interest in subsidiaries 36 2 8 –––––– 2 4 4 9 1\\nTotal equity 84,286 76,123 71,038 57,523 56,593 51,076 45,721 44,345 42,330 39,913\\nBMO adopted various new and amended IFRS standards in 2015, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) in 2018 and IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16) in 2020 prospectively, with no changes to prior periods.

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in \\nthis guideline.\\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the \\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \\n \\n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \\nrequirements described in OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .   \\n\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 2 Chapter 1  - Overview of risk -based capital \\nrequirements  \\n \\nThe Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) for banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies are set out in nine chapters, each of which has been issued as a separate document.

Outlined below is an overview of the capital adequacy requirements for banks \\n(including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies , collectively referred to as ‘institutions’.  \\n 2. This chapter is drawn from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Basel \\nFramework published on the Bank for I nternational S ettlements (BIS)  website .\\n2 For reference, \\nthe Basel paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are indicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph .\\n3  \\n \\n1. 1. Scope of Application  \\n 3. The capital adequacy requirements outlined in this guideline apply on a consolidated \\nbasis to the following institutions:  \\na. all institutions designated  by OSFI as domestic systemically important banks (D -\\nSIBs); and  \\nb. small and medium- sized deposit -taking institutions (SMSBs\\n4), which fall into \\nCategories I, II or III as defined in OSFI’s SMSB Capital and Liquidity Requirements Guideline.\\n5  \\n 4. The consolidated entity includes all subsidiaries except insurance subsidiaries.\\n OSFI \\nexpects institutions to hold capital within the consolidated group in a manner that is consistent with the level and location of risk.    \\n1. 2. Regulatory Capital  \\n 5. Total capital consists of the sum of the following elements: \\ni. Tier 1 capital, consisting  of: \\na. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ; and  \\nb. Additional Tier 1 capital  \\nii. Tier 2 capital  \\n \\n \\n2    The Basel Framework   \\n3  Following the form at: [Basel Framework, XXX yy.zz]  \\n4    SMSBs are banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, \\nand federally regulated loan companies that have not been designated by OSFI as domestic systemically \\nimpo rtant banks (D -SIBs). This includes subsidiaries of SMSBs or D -SIBs that are banks (including federal \\ncredit unions) , federally regulated trust companies or federally regulated loan companies.  \\n5    SMSB Capital and Liquidity Guideline  \\n\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 5 6. The criteria for the capital elements comprising the two tiers, as well as the various \\nlimits, restrictions and regulatory adjustments to which they are subject, are de scribed in \\nChapter  2. \\n \\n1. 3. Total Risk -weighted Assets \\n \\n7. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) make up the denominator of the risk- based capital ratios, \\nand is calculated as the higher of:  \\na. the sum of the following three elements:  \\ni. RWA for credit risk;  \\nii. RWA for market risk; and  \\niii. RWA for operational risk; and \\nb. the adjusted RWA determined as per the capital floor described in section 1.5. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.4]  \\n 1.3.1. Credit Risk   8. RWA for credit risk (including counterparty credit risk) is calculated as the sum of:  \\na. Credit  RWA for banking book exposures which, except the RWA listed in (b) \\nthrough (e) below, is calculated using:   \\ni. the standar dized approach (as set out in Chapter 4); or  \\nii. the Internal Ratings -Based (IRB) approach (as set out in Chapter 5).  \\nb. RWA for counterparty credit risk from banking book exposures and trading book exposures (as set out in Chapter 7), except the exposures liste d in (c) and (f) below.  \\nc. Credit RWA for equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book calculated using one or more of the approaches set out in Chapter 4:  \\ni. The look- through approach \\nii. The mandate -based approach  \\niii. The fall -back approach  \\nd. RWA for se curitization exposures held in the banking book, calculating using one \\nor more of the approaches set out in Chapter 6:  \\ni. Securitization Standardized Approach (SEC -SA) \\nii. Securitization External  Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -ERBA)  \\niii. Securitization Internal Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -IRBA)  \\niv. Securitization Internal Assessment Approach (SEC -IAA)  \\nv.

RWA for exposures to central counterparties in the banking book and trading \\nbook, calculated using the approach set out in Chapter 7.  \\nf. RWA for the risk posed by unsettled transactions and failed trades, where the transactions are in the banking book or tra ding book and are within the scope of \\nthe rules set out in Chapter 7.  \\ng. RWA for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk for exposures in the trading and banking book, calculated as set out in Chapter 8 using either:  \\ni. The standardized approach for CVA; or  \\nii. The advanced approach for CVA.    \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.6]  \\n 9. Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \\n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \\n 11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be \\nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:  \\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;   \\n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and  \\n• own-use property, plant and equipment  \\n 12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \\nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:  \\n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and  \\n• accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \\nresult of subsequent revaluations  \\n 13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \\n \\n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \\nbooked in Canada.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 7  \\na.

Market risk requirements, as outlined in Chapter 9, apply to internationally active \\ninstitutions and all institutions designated by OSFI as D -SIBs. OSFI retains the right to apply the \\nframework to other institutions, on a case -by-case basis, if trading activities are a large \\nproportion of overall operations. \\n \\n16. Institutions subject to market risk requirements must identify the instruments that are in \\nthe trading book following the requirements of Chapter 9. All instruments that are not in the trading book and all other a ssets of the institution (termed “banking book exposures”) must be \\ntreated under one of the credit risk approaches.

Approval to use Internal Model Based Approaches  \\n \\n21. Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \\n 22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \\nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \\nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\\n8 Institutions that do not receive \\napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23. An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \\n \\n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \\nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \\n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \\nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \\n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \\nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \\n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \\n \\n \\n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implemen tation Note  \\n\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \\nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \\nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \\nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \\nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \\n \\n \\n1. 5. Capital Floor –Internal Model Based Approaches  \\n \\n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \\ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \\ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \\nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \\nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \\n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \\ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \\ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \\nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \\n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \\n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \\ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \\n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \\n \\n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \\noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \\ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \\nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \\nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline. \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 10\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \\nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \\nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \\nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \\nFiscal year  \\n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \\nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \\n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \\n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \\ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \\n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \\n \\n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \\ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter 4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this guideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \\n \\n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \\nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \\nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. After November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \\napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.   34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \\nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline.  35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \\ncalculation of the capital floor:  \\na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \\nb. SEC-IRBA;  \\nc. the IMA for market risk;  \\nd. the VaR  models approach to counterparty credit risk; and  \\n \\n10  For institutions with a fiscal year ending October 31 or December 31, respectively.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 11 e. the IMM for counterparty credit risk.11  \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.12] \\n1.5.2. Adjusted Capital Requirement  \\n \\n36. The adjusted capital requirement is based on application of all of the chapters of this \\nguideline and is equal to the net total of the following amounts: \\ni. total risk -weighted assets, plus \\nii. 12.5 times the provisioning shortfall deduction, less \\niii. 12.5 times excess provisions included in Tier 2, less \\niv. 12.5 times the amount of general allowances that may be recognized in Tier 2 in respect of exposures for which the standardized approach is used. \\n 37. The provisioning shortfall deduction, excess provisions included in Tier 2, and general \\nallowances in Tier 2 in respect of standardized portfolios are defined in section 2.1.3.7 of Chapter 2 of this guideline.  \\n1. 6. Calculation of OSFI Minimum Capital Requirements  \\n 1.6.1. Risk -Based Capital Ratios for D-SIBs and Category I and II SMSBs  \\n 38. Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for \\nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for \\nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets \\nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:  \\nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 \\n Where:  \\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \\nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \\n 39. Table 2 provides the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios for institutions \\nbefore application of the capital conservation buffer.   \\n \\n11  There are two exceptions to this rule. One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \\ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \\nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the \\nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so. Both of these \\nexceptions expire when the revised CVA framework is implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2024.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 12\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 12 Table 2: Minimum capital requirements (in RWA)  \\nCET1  4.5%  \\nTier 1  6.0%  \\nTotal  8.0%  \\n \\n1.6.2. Simplified Risk -Based Capital Ratio for Category III SMSBs \\n 40.   Category III SMSBs are subject to a Simplified Risk -Based Capital Ratio (SRBCR), \\ncalculated as follows:  \\n \\nSRBCR  =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\\n𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴\\n𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑇𝑇\\n𝑇𝑇\\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴\\n + 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶  𝑹𝑹𝑶𝑶𝑹𝑹 𝑹𝑹 \\n Where:  \\n \\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \\n \\nAdjusted Total Assets =  Total Assets from the Balance Sheet, less the aggregate of all adjustments to regulatory capital as  \\nset out in Chapter 2.  \\n \\nRWA \\nOperational Risk =  Risk-Weighted Assets for operational risk, calculated as \\ndetailed in Chapter 3 . \\n  41.

Mandated Capital Buffers  \\n 42. In addition to the minimum capital ratios, institutions are required to hold a capital \\nconservation buffer and, where applicable, a countercyclical buffer.    43. Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \\nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.20]  \\n\\n\\n## Page 13\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 13 44. When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\\n12 Institutions may also \\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In \\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions \\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \\n \\n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \\nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of RWA .\\n13 Table 4 provides the minimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conversation buffer. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.2]   \\n \\nTable 4: Capital conservation buffer (as % of RWA)  \\nCapital conservation buffer  2.5%  \\nMinimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer  \\nCET1  7.0%  \\nTier 1  8.5%  \\nTotal  10.5%  \\n 48. Capital distribution constraints will be imposed on an institution when capital levels fall \\nwithin the buffer conservation range. Institutions will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall within the buffer range as they experience losses. The constraints imposed \\n \\n12    Applies only to performance bonuses issued to institutions’ senior management. The term “senior management”  \\nis defined in OSFI’s Corporate Governance Guideline .  \\n13   For Category  III SMSBs, the capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of [Adjusted Total Assets +  \\nRWA Operational Risk ] \\n\\n\\n## Page 14\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 14 relate only to distributions, not the operations of the institution. The distribution constraints \\nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs’ Total Loss \\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \\nof earnings)  \\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \\n>7.0%  0% \\n 50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \\n \\n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio . \\n\\n\\n## Page 15\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \\npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \\nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \\n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \\n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \\n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \\nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \\nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \\nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer  \\n 53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \\naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed \\nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide \\nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential \\nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \\n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \\ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and \\nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\\n18 will be put in place  when \\n \\n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (“FISC”), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.  \\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides informat ion that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national \\nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 30.10]  \\n17  The Bank of Canada will be the primary source of public information on macro- financial developments and the \\nstate of vulnerabilities in Canada with regard to the countercyclical buffer, including as published in its Financial \\nSystem Review (FSR).  \\n18   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer requirement would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total \\nAssets + RWA Operational Risk ] \\n\\n\\n## Page 16\", 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'chunk_index': 0, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:07.307404', 'file_size': 554263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt1_0.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf'}, {'page_content': \"## Page 16\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 16 circumstances warrant.

OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of \\nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1% \\nof RWAs. The 1% capital surcharge will be periodically reviewed in light of national and international developments . This is consistent with the levels and timing set out in the BCBS D -\\nSIB framework. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.7 to 40.23]  \\n 66. The 1% surcharge will be implemented through an extension of the capital conservation \\nbuffer. This is in line with the tre atment of the higher loss absorbency requirement for global \\nsystemically important banks (G -SIBs) prescribed by the BCBS .\\n30 Table 7 below sets out the \\nminimum capital conservation ratios a D -SIB must meet at various CET1 capital ratios  and Tier \\n1 leverage ratio s.31 D-SIBs will thus be subject to a pre -determined set of restrictions on the \\n \\n25  The Superintendent will consider factors such as whether an institution’s business model involves providing \\ncredit through intermediation of funds or whether  the conditions that give rise to financial system -wide issues are \\nexplicitly addressed in a robust manner in the institution’s internal capital targets.  \\n26   The countercyclical buffer is to be computed and applied at the consolidated FRFI parent level, i. e. OSFI \\nregulated deposit -taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit -taking institution are not \\nsubject to the countercyclical buffer.  \\n27   The pre -announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.  \\n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA \\nOperational Risk ]. \\n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI’s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs.  \\n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6  \\n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D -SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements.  \\nIn the event that a D -SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CE T1, 9.5% Tier \\n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 19\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 19 ability to make distributions, such as dividends and share buy-backs, if they do not meet these \\nrequirements (see relevant provisions of section 1.7.1).  \\n \\n \\nTable 7: Minimum capital conservation ratios for D -SIBs at various ranges of \\nCET1  or Tier 1 Leverage Ratios  \\nCET1 Ratio  Tier 1 Leverage \\nRatio  Minimum Capital Conservation \\nRatio  \\n4.5% - 5.375%  3%–3.125%  100%  \\n>5.375% - 6.250%  > 3.125% –3.25%  80% \\n>6.250% - 7.125%  > 3.25% –3.375%  60% \\n>7.125% - 8.0%  > 3.375% –3.50%  40% \\n>8.0%  > 3.50%  0% \\n  \\n1. 9. Domestic Stability Buffer  \\n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \\nCommittee (FISC) .\\n33 \\n \\n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB’s total RWA calculated \\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \\nCET1 c apital.  \\n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI’s Gu ide to Intervention\\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \\n \\n \\n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n\\n\\n## Page 20\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \\nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \\nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \\n \\n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could \\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \\n \\n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to \\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In \\nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \\nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \\n \\n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \\n \\n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \\n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \\nplus the conservation buffer .\\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\\nons, where applicable.  \\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \\nsurcharge of 1.0%.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 21\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 21 Table 8: Target Capital Ratios  \\n \\n SMSBs  D-SIBs  \\nTarget CET1 capital  7.0%  8.0% plus DSB  \\nTarget Tier 1 capital  8.5%  9.5% plus DSB  \\nTarget Total capital  10.5%  11.5%  plus DSB  \\n \\n75. These targets are applicable to all institutions and are triggers for supervisory intervention \\nconsistent with OSFI’s Guide to Intervention.37 If an institution is offside the relevant target ratios, \\nsupervisory action will be taken proportional to the shortfall and circumstances that caused the shortfall and may include a range of actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on distribu tions.  \\n 76. The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions or \\ngroups of institutions where circumstances warrant, including in respect of idiosyncratic and/or systemic risks that are not adequately captured by institutions ’ Pillar I capital requirements and \\nbuffers. The need for Pillar II capital and corresponding higher target capital ratios would consider how robust existing capital ratios are in light of an institution’s allowances, stress testing program, and ICAAP results .\\n38  \\n \\n \\n37  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n38  For OSFI’s expectations refer to Guideline E -18: Stress Testing  and Guideline E -19: Internal Capital Adequac y \\nAssessment Process (ICAAP) . \\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 22 Annex 1   Domestic Systemic Importance and Capital Targets  \\n \\n1. The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \\n \\nSize  \\n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \\n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \\n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \\n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \\n \\nInter -connections \\n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \\ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \\n \\nSubstitutability  \\n \\n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \\n \\n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 23\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \\nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \\nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \\nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \\n \\n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \\nrange of evidence are the following:  \\n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \\n \\n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\\n  \\n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \\n \\nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \\n \\n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \\n \\n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks  \\n\\n\\n## Page 24\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 24 institution. The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \\ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \\npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \\n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \\n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \\n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \\n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \\n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \\n Supervisory Implications  \\n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\\n44 The Framework is applied on a \\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \\n \\n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \\n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \\nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \\n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 25\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \\nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \\n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \\n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \\nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \\n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \\n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \\n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \\n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \\norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \\ndisclosure practices;  \\n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \\nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \\n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \\n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \\n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \\nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\\n45  \\n Information Disclosure Practices  \\n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \\ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions’ risk models and risk management \\npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \\nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \\nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \\n \\n \\n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \\nImportant Financial Institutions .

Treatment of counterparty credit risk and cross -product netting  \\n 2. This rule identifies permissible methods for estimating the Exposure at Default (EAD) \\nor the exposure amount for instruments with counterparty credit risk under this guideline.\\n3  \\nInstitutions may seek OSFI approval to make use of an Internal Modelling Method (IMM) meeting the requirements and specifications identified herein. As an alternative institutions may also use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA- CCR).  [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 53.1] \\n7.1.1 Definitions and general terminology  \\n3. This section defines terms that will be used throughout this chapter. \\n \\n7.1.1.1 General terms  \\n \\n• Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR)  is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could \\ndefault before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss would occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default. Unlike an institution’s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending institution faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of the transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The market value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying market factors.  \\n• A central counterparty  (CCP) is a clearing house that interposes itself between \\ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance of open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants through novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the purposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.   \\n• A qualifying central counterparty  (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as  a \\nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted by the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products \\n \\n1    The Basel Framework   \\n2  Following the format: [Basel Framework XXX yy.zz].  \\n3 In this document, the terms “exposure at default” and “exposure amount” are used together in order to identify \\nmeasures of exposure under both an internal ratings -based (IRB) and a standardi zed approach for credit risk.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 5 offered. This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised \\nin a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the CPSS -IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.  \\nWhere the CCP is in a jurisdiction that does not have a CCP regulator applying the \\nPrinciples to the CCP, then OSFI may make the determination of whether the CCP meets \\nthis definition.  \\nIn addition, for a CCP to be considered as a QCCP, the requirements in paragraph 204 \\nmust be met to permit each clearing member institution to calculate its capital requirement for its default fund contributions.  \\n• A clearing member is a member of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is entitled to enter into a transaction with the CCP, regardless of whether it enters into trades with a CCP for its own hedging, investment or speculative purposes or wh ether it also enters \\ninto trades as a financial intermediary between the CCP and other market participants .\\n4  \\n• A client is a party to a transaction with a CCP through either a clearing member acting as \\na financial intermediary, or a clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the client \\nto the CCP.  \\n• Initial margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted to the CCP to mitigate the potential future exposure of the CCP to the clearing member arising from the possible future change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of the calculation of counterparty credit risk capital requirements, initial margin does not include contributions to a CCP for mutualized loss sharing arrangements (i.e., in case a CCP uses initial margin to mutualize losses among the clearing members, it will be treated as a default fund exposure). Initial margin may include excess collateral, in cases \\nwhere the CCP may prevent the clearing member and the clearing member may prevent the client from withdrawing the excess.   \\n• Variation margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted on a daily or intraday basis to a CCP based upon price movements of their transactions.  \\n• Trade exposures (in section 7.1.8) include the current\\n5 and potential future exposure of a \\nclearing member or a client to a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange traded derivatives transactions or securities financing transactions (SFTs), as well as initial margin.  \\n• Default funds , also known as clearing deposits or guaranty fund contributions (or any \\nother names), are clearing members’ funded or unfunded contributions towards, or underwriting of, a CCP’s mutualized loss sharing arrangements. The description given by \\n \\n4  For the purposes of this chapter, where a CCP has a link to a second CCP, that second CCP is to be treated as a \\nclearing member of the first CCP. Whether the second CCP’s collateral contribution t o the first CCP is treated as \\ninitial margin or a default fund contribution will depend upon the legal arrangement between the CCPs. OSFI \\nshould be consulted to determine the treatment of this initial margin and default fund contributions.    \\n5  For the pu rposes of this definition, the current exposure of a clearing member includes the variation margin due \\nto the clearing member but not yet received.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 6 a CCP to its mutualized loss sharing arrangements is not determinative of its status as a \\ndefault fund; rather, the substance of such arrangements will govern its status.  \\n• Offsetting transaction means the transaction leg between the clearing member and the CCP when the clearing member acts on behalf of a client (e.g. , when a clearing member \\nclears or novates a client’s trade). \\n \\n• A multi -level client structure is one in which institutions can centrally clear as indirect \\nclients; that is, when clearing services are provided to the institution by an institution which is not a direct clearing member, but is itself a client of a clearing member or another clearing client. For exposures between clients and clients of clients, we use the term “ higher -level client ” for the institution providing clearing services; and the term \\n“lower level client ” for the institution clearing through that client.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.6]  \\n \\n7.1.1.2 Transaction types  \\n \\n• Long Settlement Transactions are transactions where a counterparty undertakes to deliver a security, a commodity, or a foreign exchange amount against cash, other financial instruments, or commodities, or vice versa, at a settlement or delivery date that is contractually specified as more than the lower of the market standard for this particular instrument and five business days after the date on which the institution enters into the transaction.  \\n• Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) are transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and borrowing, and margin lending transactions, where the value of the transactions depends on market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements.  \\n• Margin Lending Transactions are transactions in which an institution extends credit in connection with the purchase, sale, carrying or trading of securities. Margin lending transactions do not include other loans that happen to be secured by securities collateral. Generally, in margin lending transactions, the loan amount is collaterali zed by securities \\nwhose value is greater than the amo unt of the loan. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.14]  \\n \\n7.1.1.3 Netting sets, hedging sets, and related terms  \\n \\n• Netting Set  is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \\nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is  recogni zed for \\nregulatory capital purposes under Chapter 4 or the Cross -Product Netting Rules set forth \\nin this chapter. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is recogni zed for regulatory capital purposes should be \\ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules.  \\n• Hedging Set  is a set of transactions within a single netting set within which full or partial \\noffsetting is recognized for purposes of calculating the potential future exposure (PFE) add-on of the SA -CCR. .  \\n\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 7 • Margin Agreement is  a contractual agreement or provisions to an agreement under \\nwhich one counterparty must supply collateral to a second counterparty when an \\nexposure of that second counterparty to the first counterpa rty exceeds a specified level.  \\n• Margin Threshold  is the largest amount of an exposure that remains outstanding until \\none party has the right to call for collateral.  \\n• Margin Period of Risk is the time period from the last exchange of collateral covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterpart until that counterpart is closed out and the resulting market risk is re -hedged.  \\n• Effective Maturity under the Internal Model Metho d for a netting set with maturity \\ngreater than one year is the ratio of the sum of expected exposure over the life of the transactions in a netting set discounted at the risk- free rate of return divided by the sum of \\nexpected exposure over one year in a ne tting set discounted at the risk -free rate. This \\neffective maturity may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing expected exposure with effective expected exposure for forecasting horizons under one year. The formula is given in paragraph 35.  \\n• Cross -Product Netting refers to the inclusion of transactions of different product \\ncategories within the same netting set pursuant to the Cross -Product  Netting Rules set out \\nin this chapter.  \\n• Current Market Value (CMV) refers to the net market value of the portfolio of \\ntransactions within the netting set with the counterparty. Both positive and negative market values are used in computing CMV. \\n[ Basel Fr amework, CRE 50.15]  \\n \\n7.1.1.4 Distributions  \\n \\n• Distribution of Market Values  is the forecast of the probability distribution of net \\nmarket values of transactions within a netting set for some future date (the forecasting horizon) given the reali zed market value of those transactions up to the present time.  \\n• Distribution of Exposures is the forecast of the probability distribution of market values that is generated by setting forecast instances of negative net market values equal to zero (this takes account of the fact that, when the institution owes the counterparty money, the institu tion does not have an exposure to the counterparty).  \\n• Risk -Neutral Distribution is  a distribution of market values or exposures at a future \\ntime period where the distribution is calculated using market implied values such as implied volatilities.  \\n• Actual D istribution is a distribution of market values or exposures at a future time \\nperiod where the distribution is calculated using historic or reali zed values such as \\nvolatilities calculated using past price or rate changes.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.22 to 50.25]  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 8\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 8 7.1.1.5 Exposure measures and adjustments  \\n \\n• Current Exposure is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction or portfolio \\nof transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default \\nof the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in \\nbankruptcy. Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.  \\n• Peak Exposure  is a high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution of \\nexposures at any particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction in the netting set. A peak exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.  \\n• Expected Exposure is the mean (average) of the distribution of exposures at any particular future date before the longest -maturity transaction in the netting set matures. \\nAn expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the \\nlongest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.  \\n• Effecti ve Expected Exposure at a specific date is the maximum expected exposure that \\noccurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as \\nthe greater of the expected exposur e at that date, or the effective exposure at the previous \\ndate. In effect, the Effective Expected Exposure is the Expected Exposure that is constrained to be non- decreasing over time.  \\n• Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of exp ected \\nexposures where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval. When calculating the minimum capital requirement, \\nthe average is taken over the first year or, if all the contracts in the net ting set mature \\nbefore one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract in the netting set.  \\n• Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE) is the weighted average over time of effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if al l the contracts in the \\nnetting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract \\nin the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval.  \\n• Credit Va luation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid -market valuation of the \\nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the credit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. This a djustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the \\nmarket value of the credit risk of both the institution and the counterparty.  \\n• One-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects \\nthe mar ket value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does not reflect the \\nmarket value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty.  \\n• Debit Valuation Adjustment  is a valuation adjustment that reflects the market value of \\nthe credit  risk of the institution to the counterparty (i.e. changes in the reporting \\ninstitution’s own credit risk), but does not reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution. [Added by OSFI]  \\n[ Basel Framework, CRE 50.26 to 50.33]  \\n\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 9  \\n7.1.1.6 CCR -related risks  \\n \\n• Rollover Risk  is the amount by which expected positive exposure is understated when \\nfuture transactions with a counterpart are expected to be conducted on an ongoing basis, \\nbut the additional exposure generated by those future transactions is not included in calculatio n of expected positive exposure.  \\n• General Wrong -Way Risk arises when the probability of defaul t of counterparties is \\npositively correlated with general market risk factors.  \\n• Specific Wrong -Way Risk arises when the exposure to a particular counterpart is \\npositively correlated with the probability of default of the counterparty due to the nature of the transactions with the counterparty.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.34 to 50.36]  \\n7.1.2 Scope of application  \\n4. Banks  must calculate a counterparty credit risk charge for all exposures that give rise to \\ncounterparty credit risk, with the exception of those transactions listed in paragraphs  10 and 11 \\nbelow. The categories of transaction that give rise to counterparty credit ris k are:  \\n• OTC Derivatives;  \\n• Exchange -traded derivatives (ETDs)  \\n• Long Settlement transactions; and \\n• Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs)  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.4]  \\n 5. Such instruments generally exhibit the following abstract characteristics:  \\n• the transactions generate a current exposure or market value;  \\n• the transactions have an associated random future market value based on market variables;  \\n• the transactions generate an exchange of future payments or an exchange of a financial instrument (including commodities) against payment;  \\n• the transactions are undertaken with an identified counterparty against which a unique probability of default can be determined.\\n6 \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.5]  \\n \\n \\n6  Transactions for which the probability of default is defined on a pooled basis are not included in this t reatment of \\nCCR.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 10\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 10 6. Other common characteristics of the transactions to be covered may include the \\nfollowing:  \\n• collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in the nature of some \\ntransactions;  \\n• short -term financing may be a primary objective in that the t ransactions mostly consist of \\nan exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a relatively short period of time, usually for the business purpose of financing. The two sides of the transactions are not the result of separate decisions but form an indivisible whole to accomplish a defined objective;  \\n• netting may be used to mitigate the risk; \\n• positions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis), according to market \\nvariables . \\n• remargining may be employed. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.6]  \\n \\n7.1.3 Methods for Computing CCR Exposure  \\n7. For the transaction types listed in paragraph 4 above, banks must calculate their \\ncounterparty credit risk exposure, or exposure at default (EAD) ,\\n7 using one of the methods set \\nout in paragraphs 8 to 9 below. The methods vary according to the type of the transaction, the \\ncounterpar ty to the transaction, and whether the bank has received supervisory approval to use \\nthe method (if such approval is required). [Basel Framework, CRE 51.7]  \\n8. For exposures that are not cleared through a central counterparty (CCP) the following \\nmethods must be used to calculate the counterparty credit risk exposure:  \\n(1) The standardi zed approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (SA -CCR), \\nwhich is set out in section 7.1.7. This method is to be used for exposures arising from OTC \\nderivatives, exchange -traded derivatives and long settlement transactions. This method must be \\nused if the bank does not have approval to use the internal model method (IMM).  \\n(2) The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of collateral, which are \\nboth set out in the credit risk mitigation section  of the standardi zed approach to credit risk (see \\nChapter 4, section 4.3). These methods are t o be used for securities financing transactions (SFTs) \\nand must be used if the bank does not have approval to use the value -at-risk (VaR) models or the \\nIMM.  \\n \\n7    The terms “exposure” and “EAD” are used interchangabl y in the counterparty credit risk chapters of the credit \\nrisk standard. This reflects the fact that the amounts calculated under the counterparty credit risk rules must \\ntypically be used as either the “exposure” within the standardi zed approach to credit ri sk, or the EAD within the \\ninternal ratings -based (IRB) approach to credit risk, as described in paragraph 13 . \\n\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 11 (3) The VaR models approach, which is set out in Chapter 4, section 4.3. The VaR models \\napproach m ay be used to calculate EAD for SFTs, subject to supervisory approval, as an \\nalternative to the method set out in (2) above.  \\n(4) The IMM, which is set out in 7.1.5. This method may be used, subject to supervisory approval, as an alternative to the methods to calculate counterparty credit risk exposures set out in (1) and (2) above (for all of the exposures referenced in those bullets).  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.8]  \\n9. For exposures that are cleared through a CCP, banks must apply the method set out in \\nsection 7.1.8. This method covers:  \\n(1) the exposures of a bank to a CCP when the bank is a clearing member of the CCP;  \\n(2) the exposures of a bank to its clients, when the bank is a clearing member and acts as an intermediary between the client and the CCP; and  \\n(3) the exposures of a bank to a clearing member of a CCP, when the bank is a client of the \\nclearing member and the clearing member is acting as an intermediary between the bank and the CCP. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.8]  \\n10. Exposures arising from the settlement of cash transactions (equi ties, fixed income, spot \\nFX and spot commodities) are not subject to this treatment .\\n8 The settlement of cash transactions \\nremains subject to the treatment described in section 7.2. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.10]  \\n 11. As an exception to the requirements of paragraph 4 above, banks are not required to \\ncalculate a counterparty credit risk charge for the following types of transactions (i.e. the \\nexposure amount or EAD for counterparty credit risk for the trans action will be zero):  \\n(1) Credit derivative protection purchased by the bank against a banking book exposure, or \\nagainst a counterparty credit risk exposure. In such cases, the bank will determine its capital \\nrequirement for the hedged exposure according t o the criteria and general rules for the \\nrecognition of credit derivatives within the standardi zed approach or IRB approach to credit risk \\n(i.e. substitution approach). \\n(2) Sold credit default swaps in the banking book where they are treated in the framework as a \\nguarantee provided by the bank and subject to a credit risk charge for the full notional amount.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.16]  \\n \\n12. Under the methods outlined above, the exposure amount or EAD for a given \\ncounterparty is equal to the sum of the exposure  amounts or EADs calculated for each netting set \\n \\n8  For contributions to prepaid default funds covering settlement- risk-only products, the applicable risk weight is \\n0%.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 12\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 12 with that counterparty,9 subject to the exception outlined in paragraph 13. [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 51.11]  \\n \\n13. The exposure or EAD for a given OTC derivative counterparty is defined as the greater \\nof zero, and the difference between the following: the sum of EADs across all netting sets with \\nthe counterparty, and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for that counterparty which has \\nalready been recogni zed by the bank as an incurred write -down (i.e., a CVA loss). This CVA \\nloss is calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit valuation adjustments or \\nfunding valuation adjustments deducted from capital under Chapter 2 of this guideline. This reduction of EAD by incurred CVA losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA risk capital requirement.  [Basel Fr amework, CRE 51.13]  \\n 14. RWAs for a given OTC derivative counterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk \\nweight under the s tandardi zed or IRB approach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the \\ncounterparty. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.12]  \\n7.1.4 Approval to adopt an internal modelling method to estimate EAD  \\n15. An institution (meaning the individual legal entity or a group) that wishes to adopt an \\ninternal modelling method to measure exposure or EAD for regulatory capital purposes must seek OSFI approval. IMM is  available both for institutions that adopt the internal ratings -based \\napproach to credit risk and for institutions for which the standardi zed approach to credit risk \\napplies to all of their credit risk exposures. Only institutions subject to the market risk rules of Chapter 9 of this guideline are permitted to apply for the use of the IMM. The institution must meet all of the requirements given in s ection  7.1.5. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.1]  \\n 16. An institution may also choose to adopt an internal modelling method to measure CCR  \\nfor regulatory capital purposes for its exposures or EAD to only OTC derivatives, to only SFTs, \\nor to both, subject to the appropriate recognition of netting specified below in section 7.1.6. The institution must apply the method to all relevant exposures within that category, except for those that are immaterial in size and risk. During the initial implementation of the internal models method, an inst itution may use the SACCR for a portion of its business. The institution must \\nsubmit a plan to OSFI to bring all material exposures for that category of transactions under the IMM. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.2]  \\n 17. For all OTC derivative transactions and for al l long settlement transactions for which an \\ninstitution has not received OSFI approval to use the internal models method, the institution must use the SA -CCR. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.3]  \\n 18. Exposures or EAD arising from long settlement transactions can be de termined using \\neither of the methods identified in this guideline regardless of the methods chosen for treating OTC derivatives and SFTs. In computing capital requirements for long settlement transactions, institutions that hold permission to use the inter nal ratings -based approach may opt to apply the \\n \\n9  Where a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets and the SA -CCR is used, refer to paragraphs \\n166 to 167.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 13\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 13 risk weights under the standardi zed approach for credit risk on a permanent basis and \\nirrespective to the materiality of such positions. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.4]  \\n \\n19. After adoption of the internal model method, the institution must comply with the above \\nrequirements on a permanent basis. Only under exceptional circumstances or for immaterial \\nexposures can an institution revert to the SA -CCR for all or part of its exposure. In all cases, the \\ninstitution must ob tain approval from OSFI to do so and demonstrate that reversion to a less \\nsophisticated method does not lead to an arbitrage of the regulatory capital rules. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.5]  \\n7.1.5 Internal Model Method: measuring exposure and minimum  requirements  \\n7.1.5.1 Exposure amount or EAD under the internal model method  \\n20. CCR exposure or EAD is measured at the level of the netting set as defined in sections \\n7.1.1 and 7.1.6. A qualifying internal model for measuring counterparty credit exposure must \\nspecify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to changes in market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, etc. The model then computes the firm’s CCR exposure for the netting set at each future date given the changes in the market variables. For margined counterparties, the model may also captur e future collateral \\nmovements. Institutions may include eligible financial collateral as defined in section 4.3.3 and Chapter 9  in their forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set, if \\nthe quantitative, qualitative and data  requirements for internal model method are met for the \\ncollateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.6]  \\n 21. To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk for exposures \\nsubject to the IMM, institutions must use the greater of the portfolio- level capital charge (not \\nincluding the CVA charge in Chapter 8) based on Effective EPE using current market data and the portfolio- level capital charge based on Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress \\ncalibration should be a single consistent  stress calibration for the whole portfolio of \\ncounterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration should be applied on a total portfolio level and not on a counterparty by counterparty basis. [Basel Framework,  CRE 53.7]  \\n 22. OSFI expects institutions to have in place a policy for verifying the adequacy of, and \\nupdating, their choice of stress period. This policy would have to be approved in advance by OSFI as part of the IMM model approval process. Changes to this policy would constitute a major modification of the IMM model . \\n 23. To the extent that an institution recogni zes collateral in exposure amount or EAD via \\ncurrent exposure, an institution would not be permitted to recogni ze the benefits in its estimates \\nof LGD.  As a result, the institution would be required to use an LGD of an otherwise similar \\nuncollaterali zed facility. In other words, it would be required to use an LGD that does not \\ninclude collateral that is already included in EAD. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.8]  \\n 24. Under the IMM, the institution need not employ a single model. Although the following \\ntext describes an internal model as a simulation model, no particular form of model is required. \\n\\n\\n## Page 14\", 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 0, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199671', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 14\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 14 Analytical models are acceptable so long as they are subject to OSFI revi ew, meet all of the \\nrequirements set forth in this section and are applied to all material exposures subject to a CCR -\\nrelated capital charge as noted above, with the exception of long settlement transactions, which \\nare treated separately, and with the exception of those exposures that are immaterial in size and risk. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.9]  25. Expected exposure or peak exposure measures should be calculated based on a \\ndistribution of exposures that accounts for the possible non- normality of the distribution of \\nexposures, including the existence of leptokurtosis (“fat tails”), where appropriate. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.10]  26. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as the product of \\nalpha times Effective EPE, as specified below (except for counterparties that have been identified as having explicit specific wrong-way risk or specific right-way risk – see paragraph 65):  \\nEAD = α  × Effective EPE   (1) \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.11] \\n27. Effective EPE (“Expected Positive Exposure”) is computed by estimating expected \\nexposure ( EE\\nt) as the average exposure at future date t , where the average is taken across \\npossible future values of relevant market risk factors, such as interest rates, foreign exchange \\nrates, etc.  The internal model estimates EE as a series of future dates t 1, t2, t3…10. Specifically, \\n“Effective EE” is computed recursively, where the current date is denoted as t 0 and Effective \\nEEt0 equals current exposure: \\nEffective EEtk = max(Effective EE tk-1, EE tk)  (2) \\nwhere the current date i s denoted as t 0 and Effective EE t0 equals current exposure.   \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.12] \\n28. In this regard, “Effective EPE” is the average Effective EE during the first year of future \\nexposure. If all contracts in the netting set mature before one year, EPE is the average of expected exposure until all contracts in the netting set mature. Effective EPE is computed as a weighted average of Effective EE:  \\nmin(1 , )\\n1kyear maturity\\ntk\\nkEffective EPE EffectiveEE t\\n== ×∆ ∑  (3) \\nwhere the weights Δ tk = t k – t k-1 allows for the case when future exposure is calculated at \\ndates that are not equally spaced over time.  \\n \\n10  In theory, the expectations should be taken with respect to the actual probability distribution of future exposure \\nand not the risk- neutral one. OSFI recogni zes that practical considerations may make it more feasible to use the \\nrisk-neutral one. As a result, OSFI will not mandate which kind of forecasting distribution to employ.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 15\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 15 [Basel Framework, CRE 53.13]  \\n29. Alpha (α) is set equal to 1.4. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.14]  \\n \\n30. OSFI retains discretion to require a higher alpha based on a f irm’s CCR exposures. \\nFactors that may require a higher alpha include the low granularity of counterparties; particularly high exposures to general wrong- way risk; particularly high correlation of market values across \\ncounterparties; and other institution- specific characteristics of CCR exposures. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.15]  \\n7.1.5.2 Own estimates for alpha \\n31. Institutions may seek OSFI approval to compute internal estimates of alpha subject to a \\nfloor of 1.2, where alpha equals the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of \\ncounterparty exposure across counterparties (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE (denominator), assuming they meet certain operating requirements. Eligible institutions must meet all the operating requirements for internal estimates of EPE and must demonstrate that their internal estimates of alpha capture in the numerator the material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of market values of transactions or of portfolios of transactions across counterparties (e.g. the correlation of defaults across counterparties and between market risk and default). [Basel Framework, CRE 53.16]  \\n 32. In the denominator, EPE must be used as if it were a fixed outstanding loan amount. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.17]   33. To this end, institutions  must ensure that the numerator and denominator of alpha are \\ncomputed in a consistent fashion with respect to the modelling methodology, parameter specifications and portfolio composition. The approach used must be based on the firm’s internal economic cap ital approach, be well -documented and be subject to independent validation. In \\naddition, institutions must review their estimates on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time. Institutions must a ssess the \\nmodel risk given the significant variation in estimates of alpha can arise from the possibility for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator, especially where convexity is present . \\nThe assessment of model risk must be part of the independent model validation and approval process and model performance monitoring. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.18]   34. Where appropriate, volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint \\nsimulation of market and credit risk should be condit ioned on the credit risk factor to reflect \\npotential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn. Internal estimates of \\nalpha should take account of the granularity of exposures. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.19]  \\n7.1.5.3 Maturity  \\n35. If the original maturity of the longest -dated contract contained in the set is greater than \\none year, the formula for effective maturity (M) in Chapter 5 is replaced with the following:  \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 16\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 16  \\nwhere df k is the risk -free discount factor for future time period t k and the remaining symbols \\nare defined above. Similar to the treatment under corporate exposures, M has a cap of five \\nyears .11  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.20] \\n 36. For netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than one year, \\nthe formula for effective maturity (M) in Chapter 5 is unchanged and a floor of one year applies, \\nwith the exception of short-term exposures as described in Chapter 5 - Internal Ratings Based \\nApproach, section 5.4.1 (iv).  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.21] \\n37. For derivative contracts subject to paragraph 65 (SWWR) and st ructured such that on \\nspecified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of \\nthe contract is zero, the remaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \\n7.1.5.4 Margin agreements \\n38. If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the internal model captures the \\neffects of margining when estimating EE, the model’s EE measure may be used directly in equation (2). Such models are noticeably more complicated than models of EPE for unmargined counterparties. As such, they are subject to a higher degree of supervisory scrutiny before they are approved, as discussed below.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.22]  39. An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to capture the \\neffects of margining. It must take into account both the current amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model must account for the nature of margin agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model mus t either model the mark -to-market change in the \\nvalue of collateral posted or apply this guideline’s rules for collateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.23]  40. For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark- to-market valuation, a \\nsupervisory floor of five business days for netting sets consisting only of repo-style transactions, and 10 business days for all other netting sets is imposed on the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling EAD with margin agreements. In the following cases a higher supervisory floor is imposed: \\n \\n11  Conceptually, M equals the effective credit duration of the counterparty exposure. A bank that uses an internal model to \\ncalculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment (CVA) can use the effective credit duration estimated by such a model in \\nplace of the above formula w ith prior approval of OSIF.  ≤\\n= >\\n≤\\n=×∆ × + ×∆ ×\\n=\\n×∆ ×∑∑\\n∑1\\n11\\n1\\n1k\\nk\\nkt year maturity\\nk kk k kk\\nk t year\\nt year\\nk kk\\nkEffective EE t df EE t df\\nM\\nEffective EE t df\\n\\n\\n## Page 17\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 17 • for all netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5,000 at any point during a \\nquarter, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of risk for the following quarter;  \\n• for netting sets cont aining one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral, or an \\nOTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of risk. For these purposes, “Illiquid collateral” and “OTC derivatives that cannot be easily replaced” must be determined in the context of stressed market conditions and will be characteri zed by the absence of continuously \\nactive markets where a counterparty would, within two or fewer days, obtain multiple price quotat ions that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market \\ndiscount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC derivative). Examples of situations where trades are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, but are not l imited to, trades that are not marked daily and trades that are subject to specific \\naccounting treatment for valuation purposes (e.g., OTC derivatives or repo- style \\ntransactions referencing securities whose fair value is determined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).  \\n• in addition, an institution must consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the institution  would be able to replace its trades.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.24]  \\n 41. If an institution has experienced more than two margin call disputes on a particular \\nnetting set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the applicable margin period of risk (before consideration of this provision), then the institution must reflect this history appropriately by using a margin period of risk that is at least double the supervisory floor for that netting set for the subsequent two quarters. In the case of derivatives subject to Guideline E-22, this paragraph only applies to variation margin call disputes.  [Basel Framework, CRE \\n53.25]  \\n 42. For re -margining with a periodicity of N -days, the margin period of risk should be at \\nleast equal to the supervis ory floor, F, plus the N days minus one day. That is,  \\n Margin Period of Risk = F + N - 1. \\n \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.26]  \\n 43. Institutions using the IMM must not capture the effect of a reduction of EAD due to any \\nclause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.27]  \\n7.1.5.5 Model validation \\n44. In order to assure itself that institutions using models have counterparty credit risk \\nmanagement systems that are conceptually soun d and implemented with integrity, OSFI will \\nspecify a number of qualitative criteria that institutions would have to meet before they are \\n\\n\\n## Page 18\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 18 permitted to use a models -based approach. The extent to which institutions meet the qualitative \\ncriteria may influence the level at which OSFI will set the multiplication factor referred to in \\nparagraph 29 (Alpha). Only those institutions in full compliance with th e qualitative criteria will \\nbe eligible for application of the minimum multiplication factor. The qualitative criteria include:  \\n• the institution must conduct a regular programme of backtesting, i.e., an ex -post \\ncomparison of the risk measures12 generated by the model against reali zed risk \\nmeasures, as well as comparing hypothetical changes based on static positions with realized measures;  \\n• the institution must carry out an initial validation and an ongoing periodic review of its IMM model and the risk measures generated by it. The validation and review must be independent of the model developers;  \\n• senior management should be actively involved in the risk control process and must \\nregard credit and counterparty credit risk control as an essential aspect of the business \\nto which significant resources need to be devoted. In this regard, the daily reports \\nprepared by the independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient  seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of \\npositions taken by individual traders and reductions in the institution’s overall risk exposure;  \\n• the institution’s internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely integrated \\ninto the day- to-day risk management process of the institution. Its output should \\naccordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling \\nits counterparty credit risk profile;  \\n• the risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with inte rnal trading and \\nexposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits should be related to the institution’s risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit function and senior management;  \\n• institutions should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented \\nset of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation of the risk measurement system. The institution’s risk measurement system must be well documented, for example, through a risk management manual that describes the basic \\nprinciples of the risk management system and that provides an explanation of the empirical techniques used to measure counterparty credit risk;  \\n• an independent review of the risk measure ment system should be carried out regularly \\nin the institution’s own internal auditing process. This review should include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk control unit. A review of the overall risk management p rocess should take place at regular intervals \\n(ideally no less than once a year) and should specifically address, at a minimum:  \\no the adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and process;  \\n \\n12  “Risk measures” refers not only to Effective EPE, the risk measure used to derive regulatory capital, but also to \\nthe other risk measures used in the calculation of Effective EPE such as the exposure distribution at a series of \\nfuture dates, the positive exposure distribution at a series of future dates, the market risk factors used to derive \\nthose exposures and the values of the constituent trades of a portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 19\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 19 o the organi zation of the risk control unit;  \\no the inte gration of counterparty credit risk measures into daily risk management;  \\no the approval process for counterparty credit risk models used in the calculation \\nof counterparty credit risk used by front office and back office personnel;  \\no the validation of any sign ificant change in the risk measurement process;  \\no the scope of counterparty credit risks captured by the risk measurement model;  \\no the integrity of the management information system; \\no the accuracy and completeness of position data;  \\no the verification of the consi stency, timeliness and reliability of data sources \\nused to run internal models, including the independence of such data sources;  \\no the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions;  \\no the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation c alculations; and  \\no the verification of the model’s accuracy as described in paragraphs 45 to 48 . \\n• the ongoing validation of counterparty credit risk models, including backtesting, must be reviewed periodically by a level of management with sufficient authority to decide the course of action that will be taken to address weaknesses in the models. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.28]  \\n 45. Institutions must document the process for initial and ongoing validation of their IMM \\nmodel to a leve l of detail that would enable a third party to recreate the analysis. Institutions \\nmust also document the calculation of the risk measures generated by the models to a level of \\ndetail that would allow a third party to re -create the risk measures. This docu mentation must set \\nout the frequency with which backtesting analysis and any other ongoing validation will be conducted, how the validation is conducted with respect to data flows and portfolios and the analyses that are used. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.29]  \\n 46. Institutions must define criteria with which to assess their EPE models and the models \\nthat input into the calculation of EPE and have a written policy in place that describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be determined and remedied. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.30]  \\n \\n47. Institutions must define how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed for \\nthe purposes of validating an EPE model and its risk measures. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.31]  \\n \\n48. When validating EPE models and its risk measures that produce forecast distributions, \\nvalidation must assess more than a single statistic of the model distribution. [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 53.32]  \\n 49. As part of the initial and ongoing validation of an IMM model and its risk measures, the \\nfollowing require ments must be met: \\n\\n\\n## Page 20\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 20 • an institution must carry out backtesting using historical data on movements in market \\nrisk factors prior to OSFI approval. Backtesting must consider a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various start (initializ ation) dates and covering a wide range of market conditions;  \\n• institutions must backtest the performance of their EPE model and the model’s relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions that support EPE. For collaterali zed trades, the prediction time horizons considered must include those \\nreflecting typical margin periods of risk applied in collaterali zed/margined trading, and \\nmust include long time horizons of at least one  year;  \\n• the pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for a given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as part of the ini tial and \\nongoing model validation process. These pricing models may be different from those used to calculate Market Risk over a short horizon. Pricing models for options must account for the non- linearity of option value with respect to market risk factor s; \\n• an EPE model must capture transaction specific information in order to aggregate \\nexposures at the level of the netting set. Institutions must verify that transactions are \\nassigned to the appropriate netting set within the model;  \\n• static, historical backtesting on representative counterparty portfolios must be a part of the validation process. At regular intervals, an institution must conduct such backtesting on a number of representative counterparty portfolios. The representative portfolios must be chose n based on their sensitivity to the material risk factors and \\ncorrelations to which the institution is exposed. In addition, IMM institutions need to conduct backtesting that is designed to test the key assumptions of the EPE model and \\nthe relevant risk me asures, e.g. the modelled relationship between tenors of the same \\nrisk factor, and the modelled relationships between risk factors;  \\n• significant differences between reali zed exposures and the forecast distribution could \\nindicate a problem with the model or the underlying data that OSFI would require the institution to correct. Under such circumstances, OSFI may require additional capital to be held while the problem is being solved;  \\n• the performance of EPE models and its risk measures must be subject to good backtesting practice. The backtesting programme must be capable of identifying poor performance in an EPE model’s risk measures;  \\n• institutions must validate their EPE models and all relevant risk measures out to time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure is calculated using an internal modelling method;  \\n• the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure must be regularly tested against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the ongoing model validation process;  \\n• the ongoing validation of an institution’s EPE model and the relevant risk measures \\ninclude an assessment of recent performance;  \\n\\n\\n## Page 21\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 21 • the frequency with which the parameters of an EPE model are updated needs to be \\nassessed as part of the validation process;  \\n• unde r the IMM, a measure that is more conservative than the metric used to calculate \\nregulatory EAD for every counterparty, may be used in place of alpha times Effective EPE with prior approval from OSFI. The degree of relative conservatism will be assessed up on initial OSFI approval and at the regular supervisory reviews of the EPE \\nmodels. The institution must validate the conservatism regularly; \\n• the ongoing assessment of model performance needs to cover all counterparties for which the models are used;  \\n• the va lidation of IMM models must assess whether or not the institution level and \\nnetting set exposure calculations of EPE are appropriate.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.33]  \\n \\n50. In the case where the pricing model used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure \\nis different than the pricing model used to calculate Market Risk over a short horizon, OSFI \\nexpects institutions to provide documented justification for the use of two different pricing models, including an assessment of the resulting model risk. \\n7.1.5.6 Operational requirements for EPE models   \\n51. In order to be eligible to adopt an internal model for estimating EPE arising from CCR \\nfor regulatory capital purposes, an institution must meet the following operational requirements. \\nThese include meeting the requirements related to the qualifying standards on CCR Management, a use test, stress testing, identification of wrong- way risk, and internal controls. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.34]  \\n Qualifying standards on CCR Management  \\n 52. The institution must satisfy its supe rvisor that, in addition to meeting the operational \\nrequirements identified in paragraphs 53 to 82 below, it adheres to sound practices for CCR management.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.35]  \\n Use test  \\n 53. The distribution of exposures generated by the internal model used to calculate effective \\nEPE must be closely integrated into the day- to-day CCR management process of the institution. \\nFor example, the institution could use the peak exposure from the distri butions for counterparty \\ncredit limits or expected positive exposure for its internal allocation of capital. The internal model’s output must accordingly play an essential role in the credit approval, counterparty credit risk management, internal capital a llocations, and corporate governance of institutions that seek \\napproval to apply such models for capital adequacy purposes. Models and estimates designed and implemented exclusively to qualify for the internal models method are not acceptable. [ Basel \\nFrame work, CRE 53.36]  \\n  \\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 22 54. An institution must have a credible track record in the use of internal models that \\ngenerate a distribution of exposures to CCR. Thus, the institution must demonstrate that it has \\nbeen using an internal model to calculate the distributio ns of exposures upon which the EPE \\ncalculation is based that meets broadly the minimum requirements for at least one year prior to approval. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.37]  \\n \\n55. Institutions employing the internal model method must have an independent control uni t \\nthat is responsible for the design and implementation of the firm’s CCR management system, \\nincluding the initial and ongoing validation of the internal model. This unit must control input data integrity and produce and analyz e reports on the output of the firm’s risk measurement \\nmodel, including an evaluation of the relationship between measures of risk exposure and credit and trading limits. This unit must be independent from business credit and trading units; it must be adequately staffed; it must repor t directly to senior management of the firm. The work of this \\nunit should be closely integrated into the day -to-day credit risk management process of the firm. \\nIts output should accordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling the firm’s credit and overall risk profile. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.38]  \\n 56. Institutions applying the IMM must have a collateral management unit that is \\nresponsible for calculating and making margin calls, managing margin call disputes and reporting levels of independent amounts, initial margins and variation margins accurately on a daily basis. This unit must control the integrity of the data used to make margin calls, and ensure that it is consistent and reconciled regularly with all relevant sourc es of data within the \\ninstitution. This unit must also track the extent of reuse of collateral (both cash and non- cash) \\nand the rights that the institution gives away to its respective counterparties for the collateral that it posts. These internal reports  must indicate the categories of collateral assets that are reused, \\nand the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit quality and maturity. The unit must also track concentration to individual collateral asset classes accepted by the institutions. S enior \\nmanagement must allocate sufficient resources to this unit for its systems to have an appropriate level of operational performance, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of outgoing calls and response time to incoming calls. Senior management must ensure that this unit is adequately staffed to process calls and disputes in a timely manner even under severe market crisis, and to enable the institution to limit its number of large disputes caused by trade volumes. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.39]  \\n 57. The institution’s collateral management unit must produce and maintain appropriate \\ncollateral management information that is reported on a regular basis to senior management. Such internal reporting should include information on the type of collateral (bot h cash and non-\\ncash) received and posted, as well as the size, aging and cause for margin call disputes.

The internal model used to generate the distribution of exposures must be part of a \\ncounterparty risk management framework that includes the identification, measurement, \\nmanagement, approval and internal reporting of counterparty risk.\\n13 This framework must \\ninclude the measurement of usage of credit lines (aggregating counterparty exposures with other \\ncredit exposure s) and economic capital allocation. In addition to EPE (a measure of future \\nexposure), an institution must measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the institution must measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held. The use test  is \\nsatisfied if an institution uses other counterparty risk measures, such as peak exposure or \\npotential future exposure (PFE), based on the distribution of exposures generated by the same \\nmodel to compute EPE.

An institution  is not required to estimate or report EE daily, but to meet the use test it \\nmust have the systems capability to estimate EE daily, if necessary, unless it demonstrates to OSFI that its exposures to CCR warrant some less frequent calculation. It must choos e a time \\nprofile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future cash flows and maturity of the contracts. For example, an institution may compute EE on a daily basis for the first 10 days, once a week out to one month, once a  month out to 18 months, once a quarter out \\nto five years and beyond five years in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposure. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.43]  \\n 61. Exposure must be measured out to the life of all contracts in the netting set (not just to \\nthe one -year horizon), monitored and controlled. The institution must have procedures in place to \\nidentify and control the risks for counterparties where exposure rises beyond the one -year \\nhorizon. Moreover, the forecasted inc rease in exposure must be an input into the firm’s internal \\neconomic capital model.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.44]  \\n Stress testing  \\n 62. An institution must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the \\nassessment of capital adequacy. These stress m easures must be compared against the measure of \\nEPE and considered by the institution as part of its internal capital adequacy assessment process. Stress testing must also involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on a firm’s credit exposures and assessment of the firm’s ability to withstand such changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are; (i) economic or industry downturns, (ii) market -place events, or (iii) decreased liquid ity conditions. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.45]  \\n 63. Institutions must have a comprehensive stress testing program for counterparty credit \\nrisk. The stress testing program must include the following elements:  \\n \\n13  This section draws heavily on the Counterparty Risk Manageme nt Policy Group’s paper, Improving Counterparty Risk \\nManagement Practices  (June 1999)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 24\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 24 • institutions must ensure complete trade capture and exposure aggregation across all \\nforms of counterparty credit risk (not just OTC derivatives) at the counterparty- specific \\nlevel in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing; \\n• for all counterparties, institutions should produce, at least monthly, exposure stress testing of principal market risk factors (e.g. interest rates, FX, equities, credit spreads, and commodity prices) in order to proactively identify, and when necessary, reduce outsized concentrations to specific directional sensiti vities;  \\n• institutions should apply multi -factor stress testing scenarios and assess material non -\\ndirectional risks (i.e. , yield curve exposure, basis risks, etc.) at least quarterly. Multiple -\\nfactor stress tests should, at a minimum, aim to address scenario s in which a) severe \\neconomic or market events have occurred; b) broad market liquidity has decreased significantly; and c) the market impact of liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary. These stress tests may be part of institution -wide str ess testing;  \\n• stressed market movements have an impact not only on counterparty exposures, but \\nalso on the credit quality of counterparties. At least quarterly, institutions should \\nconduct stress testing applying stressed conditions to the joint movement of  exposures \\nand counterparty creditworthiness;  \\n• exposure stress testing (including single factor, multifactor and material non- directional \\nrisks) and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness should be performed at the counterparty- specific, counterparty group (e.g. industry and region), and aggregate \\ninstitution -wide CCR levels;  \\n• stress tests results should be integrated into regular reporting to senior management. The analysis should capture the largest counterparty- level impacts across the portfolio,  \\nmaterial concentrations within segments of the portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends;  \\n• the severity of factor shocks should be consistent with the purpose of the stress test. When evaluating  solvency under stress, factor shocks should be severe enough to \\ncapture historical extreme market environments and/or extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The impact of such shocks on capital resources should be evaluated, as well as the impa ct on capital requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day- to-\\nday portfolio monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations, institutions should also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability;  \\n• institutions should consider reve rse stress tests to identify extreme, but plausible, \\nscenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes;  \\n• senior management must take a lead role in the integration of stress testing into the risk management framework and risk culture of the instit ution and ensure that the results \\nare meaningful and proactively used to manage counterparty credit risk. At a minimum, the results of stress testing for significant exposures should be compared to guidelines that express the institution’s risk appetite an d elevated for discussion and action when \\nexcessive or concentrated risks are present.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.46]  \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 25\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 25 Wrong- way risk  \\n \\n64. Institutions must identify exposures that give rise to a greater degree of general wrong -\\nway risk. Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify risk factors that are positively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness. Such testi ng needs to address the \\npossibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed. \\nInstitutions should monitor general wrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by \\nother categories that are germane to the busin ess. Reports should be provided to senior \\nmanagement on a regular basis that communicate wrong way risks and the steps that are being taken to manage that risk.  [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.47]  \\n 65. An institution is exposed to “specific wrong- way risk” (SWWR) if  future exposure to a \\nspecific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. For example, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong -way exposures for the \\nbuyer that is specific to the counterparty. An institution must have procedures in place to identify, monitor and control cases of SWWR, beginning at the inception of a trade and continuing through the life of the trade. To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single -name credit de fault swaps \\nwhere there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals the full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the underlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the underlying instrument allows the institution to recogni ze, in respect of such swap, the market \\nvalue that has been lost a lready and any expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for Advanced or \\nFoundation IRB institutions must be set to 100% for such swap transactions .\\n14 For institutions \\nusing the s tandardi zed approach for credit risk, the risk weight to use is that of an unsecured \\ntransaction. For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. referencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying company, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD equals the value of the transaction under the assumption of a jump- to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this \\nmakes re- use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC)  that already contain an \\nLGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%. LGD for Advanced and Foundation IRB banks will be that of an unsecured exposure. For institutions using the s tandardized a pproach for credit \\nrisk, the risk weight of an unsecured transac tion should be used.  \\n \\nThe counterparty credit risk arising from trades where SWWR has been identified can be \\nmitigated through either prepayment or the collection of independent collateral amounts.

The capital \\nrequirements for such underlying exposure are to be calculated without reduction for the swap which introduces \\nwrong way risk.

An institution is exposed to “specific right -way risk” (SRWR) if the future exposure to a \\nspecific counterparty is highly inversely correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. An example of SRWR are warrants, which can be a component of  call spread \\noverlay trades written  by the counterparty on the counterparty’s stock.   \\n67. There are transactions where SRWR is present and, given the structure of these, \\ninstitutions will have a zero EAD to the counterparty if the counterparty defaults.   \\n68. Where an institution has identified SRWR, only the trade types identified in paragraph \\n69 below, and subject to due diligence ,\\n15 are permitted to receive a zero EAD. Institutions \\nwishing to add other trade types should contact OSFI’s Ca pital Division for prior permission.  \\n69. Permitted trade types include: \\n• An equity warrant , or option in each case written by the counterparty on the \\ncounterparty’s own stock  purchased as part of a call spread overlay transaction, where \\na bond hedge has also be en purchased. Call spread overlay transactions involve a \\ncounterparty issuing convertible bonds and wishing to synthetically increase the \\nconversion price.  \\n• Issuer forward as well as issuer r ange forward sales of equity whereby the institution \\nhas also simu ltaneously shorted the shares of the counterparty. Issuer and issuer range \\nforward sales of equity are typically done by a counterparty, with future capital expenditures or other funding needs, wishing to lock in a favourable current stock price or range of stock prices  without needing to issue shares until the maturity of the \\nforward or range forward transaction.  \\n• Accelerated share repurchase agreements whereby counterparties provide an \\ninstitution with funds to buy back shares in a defined peri od of time (typically under \\nsix months). \\n \\n15 Trade types listed in paragraph 69 do not automatically qualify for a zero EAD.

Other operational requirements focus on the internal controls needed to ensure the \\nintegrity of model inputs; specifically, the requirements address the transaction data, historical \\nmarket data, frequency of calculation, and valuation models used in measuring EPE. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.49]  \\n \\n71. The internal model must reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, \\ncomplete, and conservative fashion. Such terms include, but a re not limited to, contract notional \\namounts, maturity, reference assets, collateral thresholds, margining arrangements, netting arrangements, etc. The terms and specifications must reside in a secure database that is subject to formal and periodic audit. The process for recogni zing netting arrangements must require signoff \\nby legal staff to verify the legal enforceability of netting and be input into the database by an independent unit. The transmission of transaction terms and specifications data to the i nternal \\nmodel must also be subject to internal audit and formal reconciliation processes must be in place between the internal model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least conservatively. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.50]  \\n 72. When  the Effective EPE model is calibrated using historic market data, the institution \\nmust employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least three years of historical d ata must be used to estimate parameters of the model. Alternatively, market implied \\ndata may be used to estimate parameters of the model. In all cases, the data must be updated quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. To calculate the Eff ective EPE using a \\nstress calibration, the institution must also calibrate Effective EPE using three years of data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of an institution’s counterparties or calibrate Effective EPE using market implied data from a suitable period of stress. The following process will be used to assess the adequacy of the stress calibration:  \\n• The institution must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period coincides with a period of increased CDS or other credit spreads – such as loan or corporate bond spreads \\n– for a representative selection of the institution’s counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the institution does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, the institution should map each counterparty to specific credit spread data based on region, internal rating and business types. \\n• The exposure model for all counterparties must use data, either historic or implied, that includes the data from the stressed credit period, and must use such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration of the Effective EPE model to current data.  \\n [Basel Framework, CRE 53.52]  \\n 73. When two different calibration methods are used for different parameters within the \\nEffective EPE model, OSFI expects institutions’ model development and validation groups to provide documented justification for the choice of calibration methods that includes an assessment of the resulting model risk.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 28\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 28  \\n74. If an institution wished to recogni ze in its EAD calculations for OTC derivatives the \\neffect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, then it must model collateral jointly with the exposure. If the institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure then it must use either haircuts that meet the standards of the financial collateral \\ncomprehensive method with own haircut estimates or the standard supervisory haircuts. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.52]  \\n \\n75. If the internal model includes the effect of collateral on changes in the market value of \\nthe netting set, the institution must model collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself jointly wi th the exposure in its EAD calculations for securities -financing \\ntransactions. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.53]  \\n 76. The EPE model (and modifications made to it) must be subject to an internal model \\nvalidation process. The process must be clearly articulated in fi rms’ policies and procedures. The \\nvalidation process must specify the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which assumptions are violated and may result in an understatement of EPE. The validation process must incl ude a review of the comprehensiveness of the EPE model, for \\nexample such as whether the EPE model covers all products that have a material contribution to counterparty risk exposures.

The use of an internal model to estimate E PE, and hence the exposure amount or EAD, \\nof positions subject to a CCR capital charge will be conditional upon the explicit OSFI approval.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.55]  \\n \\n78. The BCBS has issued guidance regarding the use of internal models to estimate certain \\nparameters of risk and determine minimum capital charges against those risks. OSFI requires that institutions seeking to make use of internal models to estimate EPE meet similar requirements regarding, for example, the integrity of the risk managem ent system, the skills of staff that will \\nrely on such measures in operational areas and in control functions, the accuracy of models, and the rigour of internal controls over relevant internal processes. As an example, institutions seeking to make use of an internal model to estimate EPE must demonstrate that they meet the \\nCommittee’s general criteria for institutions seeking to make use of internal models to assess market risk exposures, but in the context of assessing counterparty credit risk.\\n16 [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.56]  \\n 79.

For capital adequacy purposes, institutions may net transactions (e.g., when determining \\nthe RC component of a netting set) subject to novation under which any obligation between an institution and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for th e same currency and value date, legally substituting \\none single amount for the previous gross obligations.

An example of such an instance would be Specific Wrong Way Risk (WWR) transac tions which are \\nrequired to each be moved to their own standalone netting set.   \\n21  The netting contract must not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or n o payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting \\nparty, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 33\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 33 • The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the \\nforeign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;  \\n• The law that governs the individual transactions; and  \\n• The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to affect the netting. \\nOSFI, after consultation when necessary with other relevant supervisors, must be satisfied that the netting is enforceable under the laws of each of the relev ant \\njurisdictions .\\n22 \\n(iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting arrangements are kept under review in light of the possible changes in relevant law.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.7]  \\n 104. There are two formulations of replacement cost de pending on whether the trades with a \\ncounterparty are subject to a margin agreement. Where a margin agreement exists, the formulation could apply both to bilateral transactions and central clearing relationships. The formulation also addresses the various arrangements that an institution may have to post and/or receive collateral that may be referred to as initial margin. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.9]  \\n A. Formulation for unmargined transactions  \\n 105. For unmargined transactions (that is, where VM is not exchanged, but collateral other \\nthan VM may be present), RC is defined as the greater of: (i) the current market value of the derivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by the institution (if any ), and (ii) zero. This is \\nconsistent with the use of replacement cost as the measure of current exposure, meaning that when the institution owes the counterparty money it has no exposure to the counterparty if it can instantly replace its trades and sell c ollateral at current market prices. Mathematically:   \\n RC = max{ V-C,0} \\nwhere V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set and C is the haircut value of net collateral held, which is calculated in accordance with the NICA methodology defined in paragraph 112. For this purpose , the value of non- cash collateral posted by the institution to its \\ncounterparty is increased and the value of the non- cash collateral received by the institution from \\nits counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same as those that apply to repo -style \\ntransactions) for the time periods described in paragraph 100.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.10 and 52.11]  \\n 106. In the above formulation, it is assumed that the replacement cost representing today’s \\nexposure to the counterparty cannot go less than zero. However, institutions sometimes hold excess collateral (even in the absence of a margin agreement) or have out -of-the-money trades \\nwhich can further protect the institution from the increase of the exposure. As discussed in paragraphs 116 to 118, the SA -CCR would allow such over -collaterali zation and negative mark-\\n \\n22  Thus, if any of these supervisors is dissatisfied about enforceability under its laws, the netting contract or \\nagreement will not meet this condition and neither counterparty could obtain supervisory benefit.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 34\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 34 to market value to reduce PFE, but would not affect replacement cost .

Bilateral transactions with a one -way margining agreement in favour of the institution’s \\ncounterparty (that is, where an institution posts, but does not collect, collateral) must be treated \\nas unmargined transactions. [ Basel Framewor k, CRE 52.10, FAQ #1]  \\n \\nB. Formulation for margined transactions  \\n 108. The RC formula for margined transactions builds on the RC formula for unmargined \\ntransactions. It also employs concepts used in standard margining agreements, as discussed more fully below. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.13]  \\n 109. The RC for margined transactions in the SA -CCR is defined as the greatest exposure \\nthat would not trigger a call for VM, taking into account the mechanics of collateral exchanges in margining agreements. Such mechanics include, for example, “Threshold”, “Minimum Transfer Amount” and “Independent Amount” in the standard industry documentation,\\n23 which are \\nfactored into a call for VM .24 [Basel Framework, CRE 52.14]  \\n C. Incorporating NICA into replacement cost  \\n 110. One objective of the SA -CCR is to more fully reflect the effect of margining agreements \\nand the associated exchange of collateral in the calculation of CCR exposures. The following paragraphs address how the exchange of collateral is incorporated into the SA -CCR. [ Basel \\nFramew ork, CRE 52.15]  \\n 111. To avoid confusion surrounding the use of terms initial margin and independent amount \\nwhich are used in various contexts and sometimes interchangeably, the term independent collateral amount (ICA) is introduced. ICA represents (i) collater al (other than VM) posted by \\nthe counterparty that the institution may seize upon default of the counterparty, the amount of which does not change in response to the value of the transactions it secures and/or (ii) the Independent Amount  (IA) parameter as defined in standard industry documentation. ICA can \\nchange in response to factors such as the value of the collateral or a change in the number of transactions in the netting set. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.16]  \\n 112. Because both an institution and its counterpar ty may be required to post ICA, it is \\nnecessary to introduce a companion term, net independent collateral amount ( NICA ), to describe \\nthe amount of collateral that an institution may use to offset its exposure on the default of the \\n \\n23  For example, the 1992 (Multicurrency- Cross Border) Master Agreement and the 2002 Master Agreement \\npublished by the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc.

NICA does not include collateral that an institution has posted to a segregated, \\nbankruptcy remote account, which presumably would be returned upon the bankruptcy of the counterparty. That is, NICA represents any collateral (segregated or unsegregated) posted by the counterparty less the unsegregated collateral posted by the institution. With respect to IA, NICA takes into account the differential of IA required for the institution minus IA required for the \\ncounterparty. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.17]  \\n \\n113. For margined trad es, the replacement cost is:  \\nRC = max{ V – C; TH + MTA – NICA;0}  \\nWhere: V and C are defined as in the unmargined formulation, except that C now includes the \\nnet variation margin amount, where the amount received by the institution is accounted with a posit ive sign and the amount posted by the institution is accounted with a negative sign, TH is \\nthe positive threshold before the counterparty must send the institution collateral, and MTA is \\nthe minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty. [ Basel Fr amework, CRE 52.18]  \\n 114. TH + MTA – NICA represents the largest exposure that would not trigger a VM call and \\nit contains levels of collateral that need always to be maintained. For example, without initial margin or IA, the greatest exposure that would not trigger a variation margin call is the threshold plus any minimum transfer amount. In the adapted formulation, NICA is subtracted from TH + MTA . This makes the calculation more accurate by fully reflecting both the actual level of \\nexposure that would not trigger a margin call and the effect of collateral held and/or posted by an \\ninstitution. The calculation is floored at zero, recogni zing that the institution may hold NICA in \\nexcess of TH + MTA , which could otherwise result in a negative replacement cost. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 52.19]  \\n7.1.7.2 PFE Add -ons \\n115. The PFE add -on consists of (i) an aggregate add- on component, which consists of add-\\nons calculated for each asset class and (ii) a multiplier that allows for the recognition of excess collateral or negative mark -to-market value for the transactions . Mathematically:  \\nPFE = multiplier ×  AddOn\\naggregate \\n \\nWhere AddOnaggregate is the aggregate add -on component and multiplier is defined as a \\nfunction of three inputs: V, C and AddOnaggregate. \\n The paragraphs below describe the inputs that enter into the calculation of the add- on formulas in \\nmore detail, and set out the formula fo r each asset class.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.20]  \\n \\n7.1.7.3 Recognition of excess collateral and negative mark -to-market  \\n116. As a general principle, over -collaterali zation should reduce capital requirements for \\ncounterparty credit risk. In fact, many institutions hold excess collateral (i.e. , collateral greater \\nthan the net market value of the derivatives contracts) precisely to offset potential increases in \\n\\n\\n## Page 36\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 36 exposure represented by the add- on. As discussed in paragraphs 105 and 113, collateral may \\nreduce the replacement cost component of th e exposure under the SA -CCR. The PFE component \\nalso reflects the risk -reducing property of excess collateral. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.21]  \\n117. For prudential reasons and in line with Basel Committee direction, OSFI applied a \\nmultiplier to the PFE component tha t decreases as excess collateral increases, without reaching \\nzero (the multiplier is floored at 5% of the PFE add -on). When the collateral held is less than the \\nnet market value of the derivative contracts (“under -collaterali zation”), the current replacement \\ncost is positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the full \\nvalue of the aggregate add -on). Where the collateral held is greater than the net market value of \\nthe derivative contracts (“over -collaterali zation”), the current replacement cost is zero and the \\nmultiplier is less than one (i.e. the PFE component is less than the full value of the aggregate add-on). [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.22]  \\n118. This multiplier will also be activated when the current value of the derivative \\ntransactions is negative. This is because out -of-the-money transactions do not currently represent \\nan exposure and have less chance to go in- the-money.

The designation of a derivative transaction to an asset class is be made on the basis of \\nits primary risk driver. Most derivative transaction s have one primary risk driver, defined by its \\nreference underlying instrument (e.g., an interest rate curve for an interest rate swap, a reference entity for a credit default swap, a foreign exchange rate for a FX call option, etc). When this \\nprimary risk  driver is clearly identifiable, the transaction will fall into one of the asset classes \\ndescribed above.

For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g., multi- asset or \\nhybrid derivatives), institutions m ust take sensitivities and volatility of the underlying into \\naccount for determining the primary risk driver.   \\nOSFI may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one asset class, \\nresulting in the same position being included in multiple  classes. In this case, for each asset class \\nto which the position is allocated, institutions must determine appropriately the sign and delta \\nadjustment of the relevant risk driver.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.27 and 52.28]  \\n \\n7.1.7.6 General steps for calculating the add- on \\n \\n122. For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and \\nattributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity or commodity. The add- on for each asset class is calculated usin g asset -class -specific formulas \\nthat represent a styli zed Effective EPE calculation under the assumption that all trades in the \\nasset class have zero current mark -to-market value (i.e. they are at -the-money). [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 52.29]  \\n123. Although the add -on formulas are asset class -specific, they have a number of features in \\ncommon. To determine the add- on, transactions in each asset class are subject to adjustment in \\nthe following general steps:  \\n1) The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each individual trade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the sensitivity of the trade to movements in the underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, exchange rates, credit spreads, e quity prices and commodity prices). The effective notional is calculated as the \\nproduct of the following parameters (i.e. D = d ×  MF ×  δ): \\na. The adjustment notional (d) . The adjusted notional is a measure of the size of \\nthe trade. For derivatives in the fore ign exchange asset class this is simply the \\nnotional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative contracted, converted to the domestic currency. For derivatives in the equity and commodity asset classes, it is simply the current price of the releva nt share or unit of commodity \\nmultiplied by the number of shares/units that the derivative references. For derivatives in the interest rate and credit asset classes, the notional amount is adjusted by a measure of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that the value of the instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to movements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads).  \\nb. The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes account of the  time period over which the potential future exposure is calculated. The \\ncalculation of the maturity factor varies depending on whether the netting set is margined or unmargined.  \\nc. The supervisory delta (δ). The supervisory delta ensures the effective notional takes into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, by having a positive or negative sign. It is also takes into account whether the \\n\\n\\n## Page 38', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 2, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199758', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 38\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 38 trade has a non -linear relationship with the underlying risk factor (which is the \\ncase for options and collateralized debt obligation tranches).  \\n2) A supervisory factor (SF)  is identified for each individual trade in the netting set.

The purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where long and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the potential future exposure. \\n4) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory \\nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset -class level to give \\nthe asset class level add -on. The method of aggregation varies between assets classes and \\nfor credit, equity and commodity derivatives.

This time period appears in the maturity factor defined in paragraphs 139 to 144 that scales down adjusted notional for unmargine d trades for all asset classes. If a derivative contract has another derivative \\ncontract as its underlying (for example, a swaption) and may be physically exercised into the underlying contract (i.e., an institution would assume a position in the underlying contract in the event of exercise), then maturity of the contract is the time period until the final settlement date of the underlying derivative contract.  \\n• For interest rate and credit derivatives,  S\\ni is the period of time (starting today) until the \\nstart of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract.

In many cases the trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity. Wh en \\nthis is not the case, institutions must use the following rules to determine the trade notional amount. \\n• Where the notional is a formula of market values, the institution must enter the current \\nmarket values to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a ll interest rate and credit derivatives with variable notional amounts specified in the \\ncontract (such as amorti zing and accreting swaps), institutions must use the average \\nnotional over the remaining life of the swap as the trade notional amount. The aver age \\nshould be calculated as “time weighted”. The averaging described in this paragraph does \\nnot cover transactions where the notional varies due to price changes (typically FX, \\nequity and commodity derivatives).  \\n• Leveraged swaps must be converted to the not ional of the equivalent unleveraged swap, \\nthat is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated notional must be multiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is multiplied by the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the \\nremaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \\n \\n26  There is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining maturity of the \\nderivative contract.

The size of the position in the collar components must be such \\nthat the digital payoff is reproduced exactly outside of the region between the two strikes. \\nThe effective notional is then computed for the bought and sold European components of the collar separately, using the option formulas for the supervisory delta in paragraph 132 \\n(the exercise date \\niT and the current value of the underlying iP of the digital option must \\nbe used). The absolute value of the digital option effective notional must be capped by the \\nratio of the digital payoff to the relevant supervisory factor. \\n• If a trade’s payoff can be represented as a combination of European option payoffs (e.g. collar, butterfly/calendar spread, straddle, strangle, etc.), each European option component must be treated as a separate trade.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.42] \\n \\n• \\nFor the purposes of effective notional calculations, multi -payment options must be represented \\nas a combination of single-payment options.

The calibration of the supervisory factors for equity derivatives rely on estimates of the \\nmarket volatility of equity indices, with the application of a conservative beta factor38 to translate \\nthis estimate into an estimate of individual volatilities.[Basel Framework, CRE 52.67]  \\n158.  Institutions are not permitted to make any modelling assumptions in the calculation of \\nthe PFE add -ons, including estimating individual volatiliti es or taking publicly available \\nestimates of beta. This is a pragmatic approach to ensure a consistent implementation across \\njurisdictions but also to keep the add -on calculation relatively simple and prudent. Therefore, \\nonly two values of supervisory fact ors have been defined for equity derivatives, one for single \\nentities and one for indices.  \\n \\n38 The beta of an individual equity measures the volatility of the stock relative to a broad market index. A value of \\nbeta greater than one means the individual equity is more volatile than the index. The greater the beta is, the \\nmore volatile the stock. The beta is calculated by running a linear regression of the stock on the broad index.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 52\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 52  [Basel Framework, CRE52.68]  \\n7.1.7.18  Add-on for commodity derivatives  \\n159. The calculation  of the add -on for the commodity derivative asset class is similar to the \\ncalculation of the add -on for the credit and equity derivative asset classes. It recognizes the full \\noffsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that reference the same type of underlying \\ncommodity. It also allows partial offsetting between derivatives that reference different types of \\ncommodity, however, this partial offsetting is only permitted within each of the four hedging sets \\nof the commodity derivative asset class, where the different commodity types are more likely to demonstrate some stable, meaningful joint dynamics. Offsetting between hedging sets is not recogni zed (e.g. a forward contract on crude oil cannot hedge a forward contract on corn). [Basel \\nframework, C RE 52.69]  \\n160. The add -on for the commodity derivative asset class (AddOn\\nCommodity) within a netting \\nset is calculated using the following steps:  \\n(1) Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set that is in the commodity derivative asset class. This is calculated as the product of the following three terms: (i) the adjusted notional of the trade (d); (ii) the supervisory delta adjustment of \\nthe trade ( δ); and (iii) the maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, D\\ni = d i × δi × \\nMF i. \\n(2) Step 2: Allocate the trades in the commodity derivative asset class to hedging sets. In the \\ncommodity derivative asset class there are four hedging sets consisting of derivatives that reference: energy, metals, agriculture and other commodit ies. \\n(3) Step 3: Calculate the combined effective notional for all derivatives within each hedging set that reference the same commodity type (e.g. , all derivatives that reference copper \\nwithin the metals hedging set). The combined effective notional of the co mmodity type \\n(EN\\nComType ) is calculated by adding together the trade level effective notionals calculated \\nin step 1 that reference the commodity type. \\n(4) Step 4: Calculate the add -on for each commodity type (AddOn ComType ) within each \\nhedging set by multiplying the combined effective notional for that commodity calculated in step 3 by the supervisory factor that is specified for that commodity type (SF\\nComType ). \\nThe supervisory factors are set out in Table 2 in paragraph 162 and are set to 40% for \\nelectricity derivatives and 18% for derivatives that reference all other types of \\ncommodities.  \\n(5) Step 5: Calculate the add -on for each of the four commodi ty hedging sets (AddOn HS) by \\nusing the formula that follows. In the formula the summations are across all commodity \\ntypes within the hedging set, AddOn ComType  is the add -on amount calculated in step 4 for \\neach commodity type and ρ ComType  is the supervisory prescribed correlation factor \\ncorresponding to the commodity type.

Regarding the calculation steps above, defining individual commodity types is \\noperationally difficult. In fact, it is impossible to  fully specify all relevant distinctions between \\ncommodity types so that all basis risk is captured. For example crude oil could be a commodity \\ntype within the energy hedging set, but in certain cases this definition could omit a substantial \\nbasis risk bet ween different types of crude oil (West Texas Intermediate, Brent, Saudi Light, etc). \\nAlso, the four commodity type hedging sets have been defined without regard to characteristics \\nsuch as location and quality. For example, the energy hedging set contains commodity types such \\nas crude oil, electricity, natural gas and coal.

If multiple margin agreements apply to a single netting set, (for example: one Credit \\nSupport Annex [CSA] for VM and one for Initial Margin [IM]), all collateral collected against the netting set in question can be used to offset exposures as if it were collected in a single netting set, provided the institution has performed sufficient legal review to ensure the requirements of paragraph 103 are satisfied.  \\nWhen multiple CSAs apply to an individual netting set, the RC and PFE are calculated as follows:  \\nRC \\n• The V and C terms should consider all transactions within a netting set, across all CSAs; and \\n• The TH + MTA - NICA is the sum of the thresholds and MTAs across all CSA \\nagreement.  \\n \\nPFE \\n• In the multiplier term, similarly to RC, the V and C terms should consider all transactions  \\nin the netting set across all CSA agreements; and  \\n• The margin period of risk applied to calculate effective notionals is specific to the individual CSA to which a trade belongs. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.74] \\n\\n\\n## Page 55\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 55  \\n166. If a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets, special treatment is \\nnecessary because it is problematic to allocate the common collateral to individual netting sets. The replacement cost at any given time is determined by the sum of two terms. The first term is equal to the unmargined current exposure of the institution to the counterparty aggregated across \\nall netting sets within the margin agreement reduced by the positive current net collateral (i.e. \\ncollateral is subtracted only when the institution is a net holder of collatera l). The second term is \\nnon-zero only when the institution is a net poster of collateral: it is equal to the current net posted \\ncollateral (if there is any) reduced by the unmargined current exposure of the counterparty to the \\ninstitution aggregated across all netting sets within the margin agreement. Net collateral available to the institution should include both VM and NICA. Mathematically, RC for the entire margin agreement is: \\n𝑀𝑀𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴=𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚��𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚{𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆;0}−𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚{𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴;0};0\\n𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴�+𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚��𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚{𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆;0}−𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚{𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴;0};0\\n𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴� \\nwhere the summation 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴is across the netting sets covered by the margin agreement \\n(hence the notation), V NS is the current mark -to-market value of the netting set NS and C MA is the \\ncash equivalent value of all currently avail able collateral under the margin agreement.  \\n[Basel Framework 52.75]  \\n 167. Where a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets as described in \\nparagraph 166, collateral will be exchanged based on mark -to-market values that are netted \\nacross all transactions covered under the margin agreement, irrespective of netting sets. That is, collateral exch anged on a net basis may not be sufficient to cover PFE.  \\nIn this situation, therefore, the PFE add -on must be calculated according to the unmargined \\nmethodology. Netting set -level PFEs are then aggregated.

Netting sets with positive market values must first be allocated collateral up to the amount of those market values. Only after all positi ve market values have been compensated may surplus \\ncollateral be attributed freely among all netting sets.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 56\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 56 • If the institution is a net provider of collateral (C<0), all of the individual amounts \\nallocated to the individual netting sets must also be negativ e or zero. Netting sets with \\nnegative market values must first be allocated collateral up to the amount of their market values. If the collateral provided is larger than the sum of the negative market values, then all multipliers must be set equal to 1 and  no allocation is necessary.  \\n• The allocated parts must add up to the total collateral available for the margin agreement.  \\n Apart from these limitations, institutions may allocate available collateral at their discretion. The multiplier is then calculated pe r netting set according to paragraph 118 taking the allocated \\namount of collateral into account.  \\n[Basel Framework 52.76]  \\n168. Eligible collateral which is taken outside a netting set, but is available to a bank to offset \\nlosses due to counterparty default on one netting set only, should be treated as an independent collateral amount associated with the netting set and used within  the calculation of replacement \\ncost in paragraph 105 when the netting set is unmargined and in paragraph 113 when the netting \\nset is margined. Eligible collateral which is taken outside a netting set, and is available to a bank to offset losses due to counterparty default on more than one nett ing set, should be treated as \\ncollateral taken under a margin agreement applicable to multiple netting sets, in which case the treatment in paragraphs 166 and 167 applies.

The risk weight applied to collateral posted to the CCP by the institution must be determined in accordance with paragraphs 185 to 188. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.7]  \\n176. The exposure amount for such trade exposur e is to be calculated in accordance with this \\nchapter using the IMM or the SACCR, as consistently applied by such an institution to such an exposure in the ordinary course of its business, or Chapter 4 for collaterali zed transactions.

The two conditions referenced in paragraph 181 above are:  \\n(1) The offsetting transactions are identified by the CCP as client transactions and collateral \\nto support them is held by the CCP and/or the clearing member, as applicable, under arrangements that prevent any losses to the client due to: (a) the default or insolvency of the clearing member;  (b) the default or insolvency of the clearing member’s other clients; \\nand (c) the joint default or insolvency of the clearing member and any of its other clients. Regarding the condition set out in this paragraph:  \\na. Upon the insolvency of the clearing member, there must be no legal impediment (other than the need to obtain a court order to which the client is entitled) to the transfer of the collateral belonging to clients of a defaulting clearing member to the CCP, t o one or more other surviving clearing members or to the client or the \\nclient’s nominee.  \\nb. The client must have conducted a sufficient legal review (and undertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability) and have a well founded basis to conclude that, in the event of legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find that such arrangements mentioned above would be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the relevant laws of the relevant jurisdictio n(s). \\n(2) Relevant laws, regulation, rules, contractual, or administrative arrangements provide that the offsetting transactions with the defaulted or insolvent clearing member are highly likely to continue to be indirectly transacted through the CCP, or by the CCP, if the clearing member defaults or becomes insolvent. In such circumstances, the client \\npositions and collateral with the CCP will be transferred at market value unless the client requests to close out the position at market value. Regarding the condition set out in this paragraph, if there is a clear precedent for transactions being ported at a CCP and industry intent for this practice to continue, then these factors must be considered when assessing if trades are highly likely to be ported. The fac t that CCP documentation does \\nnot prohibit client trades from being ported is not sufficient to say they are highly likely to be ported.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.15]  \\n 183. Where a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member and \\nanother client of the clearing member jointly default or become jointly insolvent, but all other \\nconditions in the preceding paragraph are met, a risk weight of 4% will apply to the client’s exposure to the clearing member, or to the higher level client, respe ctively.

The counterparty credit risk requirements arise where assets or collateral \\nof a clearing member or client are posted with a CCP or a clearing member and are not held in a \\nbankruptcy r emote manner.

Where such collateral is included in the definition of trade exposures and the entity \\nholding the collateral is the CCP, the following risk weights apply where the assets or collateral is not hel d on a bankruptcy- remote basis:  \\n(1) For institutions that are clearing members a risk -weight of 2% applies. \\n(2) For institutions that are clients of clearing members: \\na) A 2% risk weight applies if the conditions in paragraph 181 and 182 are met; or  \\nb) A 4% risk weight applied if the conditions in paragraph 183 are met  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.20]  \\n188. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trades exposures, there is no \\ncapital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposures if the col lateral is: (a) held by a \\ncustodian;\\n44 and (b) bankruptcy remote from the CCP. Regarding this paragraph, all forms of \\ncollateral are included, such as: cash, securities, other pledged assets, and excess initial or variation margin, also called overcollater alization, that is held by a custodian, and is bankruptcy \\nremote from the CCP, is not subject to a capital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposure \\n \\n43  Collateral posted must receive the banking book or trading book treatment it would receive if it had not been \\nposted to the CCP. In addition, this collateral is subject to the CCR framework of the Basel rules, regardless of \\nwhether it is in th e banking or trading book. This includes the increase due to haircuts under either the \\nstandardized supervisory haircuts or the own estimates.   \\n44  In this paragraph, the word “custodian” may include a trustee, agent, pledgee, secured creditor or any other  \\nperson that holds property in a way that does not give such person a beneficial interest in such property and will not result in such property being subject to legally -enforceable claims by such persons creditors, or to a court -\\nordered stay of the return of such property, if such person becomes insolvent or bankrupt.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 62\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 62 to such bankruptcy remote custodian (i.e. the related risk weight or EAD is equal to zero). [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 54.21]  \\n189. The relevant risk weight of the CCP will apply to assets or collateral posted by a bank \\nthat do not meet the definition of trade exposures (for example, treating the exposure as a financial institution under the s tandardized a pproach or i nternal r atings -based a pproach to credit \\nrisk).  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.22]  \\n190. Regarding the calculation of the exposure, or EAD, where banks use the SA -CCR to \\ncalculate exposures, collateral posted which is not held in a bankruptcy remote manner must be accounted for in the net independent collateral amount term in accordance with paragraph 110 to 114. For banks using IM M models, the alpha multiplier must be applied to the exposure on \\nposted collateral. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.23]  \\n B. Default fund exposures  \\n 191. Where a default fund is shared between products or types of business with settlement \\nrisk only (e.g., equities and bonds) and products or types of business which give rise to counterparty credit risk (i.e., OTC derivatives, exchange -traded derivatives, SFTs or long \\nsettlement transactions), all of the default fund contributions will receive the risk weigh t \\ndetermined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below, without apportioning to different classes or types of business or products. However, where the default fund contributions from clearing members are segregated by product types and only accessible for specific product types, the capital requirements for those default fund exposures determined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below must be calculated for each specific product giving rise to counterparty credit risk. In case the CCP’s prefunded own resources are shared among \\nproduct types, the CCP will have to allocate those funds to each of the calculations, in proportion to the respective product specific EAD.  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.24]  \\n192. Whenever an institution is required to capitalize for exposures arising from default fund \\ncontributions to a QCCP, clearing member institutions will apply the following approach. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.25]  \\n193. Clearing member institutions will apply a risk weight to their default fund con tributions \\ndetermined according to a risk sensitive formula that considers (i) the size and quality of a qualifying CCP’s financial resources, (ii) the counterparty credit risk exposures of such CCP, and (iii) the application of such financial resources vi a the CCP’s loss bearing waterfall, in the \\ncase of one or more clearing member defaults. The clearing member institution’s risk sensitive \\ncapital requirement for its default fund contribution ( 𝐾𝐾\\n𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖) must be calculated using the \\nformulae and methodology set forth below. This calculation may be performed by a CCP, \\ninstitution, supervisor or other body with access to the required data, as long as the conditions in paragraphs 204 to 206 are met.  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.26]  \\n194. The clearing member bank’s risk- sensitive capital requirement for its defaul t fund \\ncontribution (K\\nCMi) is calculated in two steps:  \\n\\n\\n## Page 63\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 63 1) Calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP due to its counterparty credit \\nrisk exposures to all of its clearing members and their clients.  \\n2) Calculate the capital requirement for the clearing member institution.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.27]  \\nHypothetical Capital Requirement of the CCP  \\n195. The first step in calculating the clearing member institution’s capital requirement for its \\ndefault fund contribution is to calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP (K\\nCCP) due to its count erparty credit risk exposures to all of its clearing members and their \\nclients. K CCP is a hypothetical capital requirement for a CCP, calculated on a consistent basis \\nfor the sole purpose of determining the capitalization of clearing member default fund contributions; it does not represent the actual capital requirements for a CCP which may be \\ndetermine by a CCP and its supervisor. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.28]  \\n196. K\\nCCP is calculated using the following formula  \\n𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃=�𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖×𝑀𝑀𝑅𝑅 ×𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚  𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝐹𝐹\\n𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 \\nwhere  \\n(1) RW is a risk weight of 20%45 \\n(2) Capital ratio means 8%  \\n(3) CM is the clearing member  \\n(4) EAD i is the exposure amount of the CCP to CM ‘i’, including both the CM’s own \\ntransactions and client transactions guaranteed by the CM, and all values of collateral held by the CCP (including the CM’s prefunded default fund contribution) against these transactions, relating to the valuation at the end of the regulatory reporting date before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged.  \\n(5) The sum is over all clearing member accounts.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.29]  \\n197. Where clearing members provide client clearing services, and client transactions and \\ncollateral are held in separate (individual or omnibus) sub- accounts to the clearing member’s \\nproprietary business, each such client sub- account should enter the sum in pa ragraph 196 \\n \\n45  The 20% risk weight is a minimum requirement. As with other parts of the capital adequacy framework, OSFI \\nmay increase the risk weight. An increase in such risk weight would be appropriate if, for example, the clearing \\nmembers in a CCP are not highly rated. Any such increase in risk weight is to be communicated by the affected \\ninstitutions to the person completing this calculation.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 64', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 4, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199783', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 64\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 64 separately, i.e. the member EAD in the formula above is then the sum of the client sub-\\naccount EADs and any house sub-account EAD.

For SFTs, EAD is equal to max(EBRM i – IM i – DF i; 0), where  \\n1) EBRM i denotes the exposure value to clearing member ‘i’ before risk mitigation under \\nChapter 4; where, for the purposes of this calculation, variation margin that has been \\nexchanged (before the margin called on the final margin call of that day) enters into the mark -to-market value of the transactions;  \\n2) IM\\ni is the initial margin collateral posted by the clearing member with the CCP;  \\n \\n46  A MPOR of 10 days must be used to calculate the CCP’s potential future exposure to its clearing members on \\nderivatives transactions  \\n47  For exposures to QCCPs located in jurisdictions where the SA -CCR has not been implemented the EAD may be \\ncomputed using the current exposure method as described Capital requirements for bank exposures to central \\ncounterparties . \\n\\n\\n## Page 65\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 65 3) DF i is the prefunded default fund contribution by the clearing member that will be \\napplied upon such clearing member’s default, either along with or immediately following \\nsuch member’s initial margin, to reduce the CCP loss.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.34]  \\n202.

The second step in calculatingthe clearing member institution’s capital requirement for \\nits default fund contributions (K\\nCMi) is to apply the following formula:  \\n𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖=𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚�𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃×�𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜\\n𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃+𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜�;8% ×2% ×𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜� \\nwhere  \\n• 𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖is the capital requirements on the default contribution of member i;  \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜is the total prefunded default fund contributions from clearing members ; \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃 is the CCP’s pr efunded own resources ( e.g. contributed capital, retained \\nearnings, etc ), which are contributed to the default waterfall, where these are \\njunior or pari pass u to prefunded member  contributions ; and   \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜is the prefunded default fund contributions provided by clearing member i .  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.36]  \\n204.

Transactions settled through a delivery- versus -payment system (DvP) ,48 providing \\nsimultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose firms to a risk of loss on the difference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the transaction valued at \\ncurrent market price (i.e. , positive current exposure). Transactions where cash is paid without \\nreceipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, foreign currencies, gold, or commodities) or, \\nconversely, deliverables were delivered without receipt of the corresponding cash payment (non -\\nDvP, or free -delivery) expose firms to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or \\ndeliverables delivered. The current rules set out specific capital charges that address these two \\nkinds of exposures.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.3 and 70.4]  \\n 213. The following capital treatment is applicable to all transactions on securities, foreign \\nexchange instruments, and commodities that give rise to a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. \\nThis includes transactions through recogni zed clearing houses and central counterparties that are \\nsubject to daily mark -to-market and payment of daily variation margins and that involve a \\nmismatched trade .\\n49 The treatment does not apply to the instruments that are subject to the \\ncounterparty credit risk requirements set out in section 7.1 or the credit risk mitigation section of \\nchapter 4 of this guideline (i.e. over -the-counter derivatives, exchange -traded derivatives, long \\nsettlement transactions, securities financing transa ctions).[ Basel Framework, CRE 70.5]  \\n 214. In cases of a system wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central \\ncounterparty, a national supervisor may use its discretion to waive capital charges until the situation is rectified. [BCBS June 2006 Annex 3 par 4] and [Basel Framework, CRE 70.7]  \\n 215. Failure of a counterparty to settle a trade in itself will not be deemed a default for \\npurposes of credit risk under this guideline.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.8]  \\n 216. In applying a risk weight to failed free -delivery exposures, institutions using the IRB \\napproach for credit risk may assign PDs to counterparties for which they have no other banking book exposure on the basis of the counterparty’s external rating. Institutions using the Advanced IRB approach may use a 45 % LGD in lieu of estimating LGDs so long as they apply it to all \\nfailed trade exposures. Alternatively, institutions using the IRB approach may opt to apply the standardi zed approach risk weights or a 100% risk weight.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.10]  \\n \\n48  For the purpose of this guideline, DvP transactions include payment -versus -payment (PvP) transactions.  \\n49  An expos ure value of zero for counterparty credit risk can be attributed to payment transactions (e.g. funds \\ntransfer transactions) and other spot transactions that are outstanding with a central counterparty (e.g. a clearing \\nhouse), when the central counterparty CCR exposures with all participants in its arrangements are fully \\ncollateraliz ed on a daily basis.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 68\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 68 7.2.2 Capital  requirements  \\n217. For DvP  transactions, if the payments have not yet taken place five business days after \\nthe settlement date, firms must calculate a capital charge by multiplying the positive current \\nexposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor, according to the Table 3. \\n \\n \\nTable 3  \\nNumber of working days after the \\nagreed settlement date  Corresponding risk multiplier  \\nFrom 5 to 15  8% \\nFrom 16 to 30  50% \\nFrom 31 to 45  75% \\n46 or more  100%  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 70.9]  \\n \\n218. For non- DvP transactions (i.e. , free deliveries), after the first contractual \\npayment/delivery leg, the institution that has made the payment will treat its exposure as a loan if the second leg has not been received by the end of the business day.\\n50 This means that an \\ninstitution under the IRB approach will apply the appropriate IRB formula set out in this guideline, for the exposure to the counterparty, in the same way as it does for all other banking \\nbook exposures. Similarly, institutions under the standardi zed approach will use the s tandardi zed \\nrisk weights set forth in this guideline. However, when exposures are not material, institutions \\nmay choose to apply a uniform 100% risk- weight to these exposures, in order to avoid the \\nburden of a full credit assessment. If five business days after the second contractual payment/delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the institution that has \\nmade the first payment leg will deduct from capital the full amount of the value transferred plus \\nreplacement cost, if any. This  treatment will apply until the second payment/delivery leg is \\neffectively made.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.4]  \\n \\n \\n50  If the dates when two payment legs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is \\nmade, it is deemed that they are settled on the same day.

Finance is broadly categorized\\ninto three areas: personal ﬁnance (managing individual or household ﬁnances), corporate\\nﬁnance (managing business ﬁnances), and public ﬁnance (managing government revenues\\nand expenditures). The primary goal of ﬁnance is to maximize value while balancing liq-\\nuidity and proﬁtability.\\nWhat is Risk?\\nRisk refers to the uncertainty or potential for loss in ﬁnancial decisions or investments.\\nIt arises from factors such as market volatility, economic changes, or unforeseen events.\\nIn ﬁnance, risk is often measured by the likelihood and magnitude of deviations from\\nexpected outcomes. Common types of ﬁnancial risk include market risk (price ﬂuctua-\\ntions), credit risk (default on loans), liquidity risk (inability to convert assets to cash),\\nand operational risk (failures in processes or systems).\\nThe Relationship Between Finance and Risk\\nFinance and risk are inherently linked, as ﬁnancial decisions involve weighing potential\\nreturns against uncertainties. Eﬀective ﬁnancial management requires assessing and mit-\\nigating risks through strategies like diversiﬁcation, hedging, or insurance.

We believe that the non-GAAP measures and ratios presented here, read together with our GAAP results, provide readerswith a better understanding of how management assesses results and are a reflection of ongoing business performance.\\nAdjusted results and measures in this section, including earnings per share (EPS), EPS growth, return on equity (ROE), return on tangible common\\nequity (ROTCE), net income, revenue, non-interest expense, efficiency ratio and operating leverage, are non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, an d\\nare discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nInformation regarding the composition of each of these measures is provided in the Glossary of Financial Terms.\\nFinancial Objectives\\nBMO has established medium-term financial objectives for certain important performance measures, which are set out below. Medium-term isgenerally defined as three to five years, and performance is assessed on an adjusted basis. These objectives serve as guideposts and assume anormal business environment and credit cycle. We aim to deliver top-tier total shareholder return and achieve our financial objectives by aligning o ur\\noperations with, and executing on, our strategic priorities.\\nOur business planning process is rigorous, sets ambitious goals and considers factors such as the prevailing economic environment, our risk\\nappetite, customers’ evolving needs and opportunities available across our operating groups. It includes clear and direct accountability for annu al\\nperformance that is measured against both internal and external benchmarks and progress toward our strategic priorities. We seek a balancebetween current profitability and investing to create sustainable growth. Our ability to achieve these objectives may be affected by changes in theeconomic, business or regulatory environment or extraordinary developments.\\nBMO’s results in fiscal 2024 were impacted by higher provisions for credit losses, in part due to a prolonged period of high interest rates, which\\nalso contributed to a more challenging U.S. banking market. Higher credit provisions more than offset our strong expense management. As a result,BMO did not achieve several of its medium-term financial objectives on an adjusted basis. Although an ROE of 15% will be challenging to meet in thenear term, in an environment where credit losses decline from elevated levels, we believe it to be an appropriate medium-term financial objective aswe execute our strategic plan to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our business. BMO has delivered positive operating leverage in four of th e\\nlast five years.

Unless otherwise indicated, all\\namounts are in Canadian dollars and have been derived from our audited annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance withInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. References to GAAP mean IFRS. We usea number of financial measures to assess our performance, as well as the performance of our operating segments, including amounts, measures andratios that are presented on a non-GAAP basis, as described below. We believe that these non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, read togetherwith our GAAP results, provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses results.\\nNon-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP. They are unlikely to be comparable to similar\\nmeasures presented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results.\\nFor further information regarding the composition of other financial measures, including supplementary financial measures, refer to the Glossary\\nof Financial Terms.\\nOur non-GAAP measures broadly fall into the following categories:\\nAdjusted measures and ratios\\nManagement considers both reported and adjusted results and measures to be useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance.\\nAdjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expense, provision for credit losses and income taxes, asdetailed in the following table. Adjusted results and measures presented in this document are non-GAAP. Presenting results on both a reported basisand an adjusted basis permits readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess resultsexcluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. As such, the presentation may facilitate readers’ analysis oftrends. Except as otherwise noted, management’s discussion of changes in reported results in this document applies equally to changes in thecorresponding adjusted results.\\nTangible common equity and return on tangible common equity\\nTangible common equity is calculated as common shareholders’ equity, less goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, net of related defe rred\\ntax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is calculated as net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for the amortizati on\\nof acquisition-related intangible assets, as a percentage of average tangible common equity. ROTCE is commonly used in the North American bankingindustry and is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed organically.\\nMeasures net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities\\nFor periods prior to November 1, 2022, we presented adjusted revenue on a basis net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefitliabilities (CCPB), and our efficiency ratio and operating leverage were calculated on a similar basis.

However, the federal government’s intent tosignificantly reduce immigration and the expected rate of population growth over the next two years implies some downside risk to GDP growth. Theunemployment rate increased by almost one percentage point during the past year to 6.5% in October 2024, due to a rapidly expanding labour forceand slowing employment growth. The unemployment rate is anticipated to rise to 7.0% by early 2025, before falling modestly as economic growthimproves and population growth slows. Easing labour shortages and lower gasoline prices contributed to the moderate 2.0% year-over-year growthin the consumer price index in October 2024. With inflation declining faster than anticipated, the Bank of Canada has lowered its key policy rate by acumulative 125 basis points since June 2024 and is expected to reduce it by an additional 125 basis points to 2.5% by June 2025. The housing marketis projected to strengthen in 2025 as a result of lower mortgage rates and new mortgage rules intended to support first-time home buyers. Industry-wide growth in residential mortgage balances remained stable at 3.5% year-over-year in September 2024, but is projected to gradually pick up ashousing market activity improves in 2025. Year-over-year growth in consumer credit (excluding mortgages) increased to 4.0% in September 2024,amid strong growth in credit card balances, though this is unlikely to be sustained in 2025. Growth in non-financial corporate credit balancesdecelerated sharply in 2024 as a result of weak business investment and elevated cash balances, but is expected to increase at a moderate pacein 2025 in response to lower interest rates. The Canadian dollar will likely remain weak due to the lower interest rate environment in Canada relativeto the United States and the threat of higher tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States, before appreciating modestly in 2025 as the U.S. dollarweakens on an easing Federal Reserve policy.\\nU.S. real GDP growth is estimated to have moderated slightly to an annual rate of 2.7% in 2024 from 2.9% in 2023, amid continued strength in\\nconsumer, business and government spending, partially offset by weaker housing market activity. With support from lower interest rates andexpansionary fiscal policies, including a possible reduction in the corporate tax rate, the economy is projected to continue growing at a healthy rat e\\nof 2.2% in 2025. While employment growth remains solid, the unemployment rate increased from a half-century low of 3.4% in April 2023 to 4.1% inOctober 2024 and is projected to rise slightly to 4.3% in early 2025. The easing in labour market conditions has reduced pressure on inflation,resulting in year-over-year growth in the consumer price index moderating to 2.6% in October 2024. The Federal Reserve lowered its key lending ratefor the first time in four years in September 2024 by 50 basis points and again in November by 25 basis points, and is projected to reduce the ratefurther by a cumulative 125 basis points to a range of 3.25% to 3.50% by late 2025. Growth in residential mortgage balances has slowedconsiderably to 1.9% year-over-year in October 2024 due to ongoing weakness in home sales, but will likely strengthen moderately in 2025 givenanticipated declines in mortgage rates. Despite increased credit card use, year-over-year growth in consumer loan balances decelerated to 1.5% inOctober 2024, but is projected to grow in 2025 due to lower interest rates. Growth in commercial, industrial and commercial real estate creditremains weak due to still elevated borrowing costs, stricter lending conditions and weakness in the office real estate market, though it is expected t o\\nstrengthen in 2025 in response to lower interest rates.\\nThe economic outlook is subject to several risks that could lead to a less favourable outcome for the North American economy. These include\\npotential higher tariffs on U.S. imports, an escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, heightened tensions between the United States an d\\nChina over trade relations and Taiwan, tensions between Canada and India, and a possible strike by U.S. East and Gulf Coast dockworkers inJanuary 2025. In addition, the Canadian dollar faces downside risks from possible U.S. tariffs and the upcoming renegotiation of the Canada-UnitedStates-Mexico Trade Agreement (CUSMA) in 2026.

Net interest income, excluding tradin g, is presented on a basis that excludes trading-related interest incom e.\\nNet Interest Margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, exp ressed as a percentage or in basi s points. Net interest margin,\\nexcluding trading net interest income, and tradi ng and insurance average assets is calculated in th e same manner, excluding trading-related intere st\\nincome, and trading and insurance earning assets.\\nAverage Earning Assets represent the daily average balance of deposits at central b anks, deposits with other banks, securities borrowed or\\npurchased under resale agreements, securities and loans over the period.\\nTrading-Related Revenue comprises net interest income and non-interest revenue ea rned from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions\\nundertaken for trading purposes. We earn revenue from profitably managi ng our positions with clients and, on a limited basis, from our principal\\ntrading positions, subject to prescribed limits. The management of these p ositions typically includes marking them to market on a daily basis. Since\\ntrading activities and related risk management s trategies can periodically shift trading income between net interest income and non-interest inco me,\\nwe view total trading income as the most appropriate measure of trading performance.\\nNet Interest Income\\nReported net interest income was $19,468 million, an increase of $787 million or 4% from the prior year, and adjusted net interest incomewas $18,921 million, a decrease of $173 million or 1% from the prior year.\\nThe increase in reported net interest income primarily reflected the reversal of accrued interest on the fiscal 2022 legal provision in the current\\nyear and the impact of fair value management actions related to Bank of the West in the prior year. Adjusted net interest income decreased, reflectingstrong growth in Canadian P&C driven by higher balances and margins, higher balances in U.S. P&C and an increase in non-trading interest income inBMO Capital Markets, more than offset by lower net interest income in Corporate Services and lower trading-related net interest income. Trading-related net interest income was $169 million, a decrease of $731 million from the prior year, and was largely offset in trading non-interest revenue.\\nBMO’s overall reported net interest margin of 1.57% decreased 6 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted net interest margin, excluding\\ntrading-related net interest income, and trading and insurance assets was 1.85%, a decrease of 3 basis points, primarily due to lower net interestincome and higher low-yielding assets in Corporate Services, partially offset by higher margins in BMO Capital Markets and Canadian P&C.\\nChange in Net Interest Income, Average Earning Assets and Net Interest Margin(1)\\nTABLE 10\\nNet interest margin\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted) Net interest income (2) Average earning assets (3) (in basis points)\\nFor the year ended October 31 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\\nCanadian P&C 8,852 8,043 319,795 296,164 277 272\\nU.S. P&C 8,162 7,607 215,987 195,363 378 389\\nPersonal and Commercial Banking (P&C) 17,014 15,650 535,782 491,527 318 318\\nAll other operating groups and Corporate Services (4) 2,454 3,031 701,463 654,343 na na\\nTotal reported 19,468 18,681 1,237,245 1,145,870 157 163\\nTotal adjusted 18,921 19,094 1,237,245 1,145,870 153 167\\nTrading net interest income, trading and insurance assets 169 900 222,149 180,005 na na\\nTotal reported, excluding trading and insurance 19,299 17,781 1,015,096 965,865 190 184\\nTotal adjusted, excluding trading and insurance 18,752 18,194 1,015,096 965,865 185 188\\nU.S. P&C (US$ in millions) 6,006 5,635 158,919 144,732 378 389\\n(1) Adjusted results and ratios are on a non-GAAP basis and are discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\n(2) Operating group revenue is presented on a taxable equivalent basis (teb) in net interest income.

The reported effective tax rate was 23.2%, compared with 25.4% in\\nthe prior year, primarily due to earnings mix, including the impact of certain Canadian tax measures recorded in fiscal 2023. The adjusted provision f or\\nincome taxes was $2,213 million, compared with $2,517 million in the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.9%, compared with 22.4% inthe prior year.\\nBMO partially hedges, for accounting purposes, the foreign exchange risk arising from investments in foreign operations by funding the\\ninvestments in the corresponding foreign currency. A gain or loss on hedging activities and an unrealized gain or loss on translation of foreignoperations are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. For income tax purposes, a gain or loss on hedging activities results in an incometax charge or credit in the current period that is charged or credited to other comprehensive income, while the associated unrealized gain or loss oninvestments in foreign operations does not incur income taxes until the investments are liquidated. The income tax charge/benefit arising from ahedging gain/loss is a function of the fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period. Hedging of investments in foreign operations has givenrise to an income tax recovery in other comprehensive income of $38 million in the current year, compared with a recovery of $90 million in theprior year.\\nThe provision for income taxes presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income is based on transactions recorded in income, regardless of\\nwhen such transactions are subject to taxation by tax authorities, with the exception of the repatriation of retained earnings from subsidiaries.\\nManagement assesses BMO’s consolidated results and the associated provision for income taxes on a GAAP basis.

Operating segment results include allocations from Corporate Services fortreasury-related revenue, corporate and T&O costs, and capital.\\nBMO employs funds transfer pricing and liquidity transfer pricing between corporate treasury and the operating segments in order to assign cost\\nor credit on assets and liabilities to facilitate effective pricing and business decision-making, and to help assess the profitability performance of each\\nline of business. These practices also capture the cost of holding supplemental liquid assets to meet contingent liquidity requirements, as well asfacilitating the management of interest rate and liquidity risk within our risk appetite framework and regulatory requirements. We review our trans fer\\npricing methodologies at least annually in order to align with our interest rate, liquidity and funding risk management practices, and update these a s\\nappropriate.\\nThe costs of Corporate Units and T&O services are largely allocated to the four operating segments, with any remaining amounts retained in\\nCorporate Services. Certain expenses directly incurred to support a specific operating segment are generally allocated to that operating segment.Other expenses are generally allocated across the operating segments in amounts that are reasonably reflective of the level of support provided toeach operating segment. We review our expense allocation methodologies at least annually, and update these as appropriate.\\nPeriodically, certain lines of business and units within our organizational structure are realigned within an operating segment or transferred\\nbetween operating segments and Corporate Services to support our strategic priorities. Allocations of revenue, expenses, provisions for income ta xes\\nand capital from Corporate Services to the operating groups are updated to better align with these changes.\\nCapital is allocated to the operating segments based on the amount of regulatory capital required to support business activities. Effective\\nfiscal 2024, our capital allocation rate increased to 11.5% of risk-weighted assets, compared with 11.0% in fiscal 2023, in order to reflect an increa se\\nin capital requirements. Unallocated capital is reported in Corporate Services. We review our capital allocation methodologies at least annually, and\\nupdate these as appropriate.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17), and retrospectively applied it to fiscal 2023\\nresults and opening retained earnings as at November 1, 2022. Insurance results are now presented in non-interest revenue under insurance serviceresults and insurance investment results. Insurance service results include insurance revenue, insurance service expenses and reinsurance resul ts.\\nInsurance investment results include net returns on insurance-related assets and the impact of the change in discount rates and financial assumptio ns\\non insurance contract liabilities. As a result of the transition to IFRS 17, we no longer report insurance claims, commissions and changes in policybenefits as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\nUpon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for the measurement of investment properties under IAS 40, Investment\\nProperties (IAS 40), recorded in insurance-related assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet from cost to fair value. This change was applied\\nretrospectively to fiscal 2023 results and opening retained earnings as at November 1, 2022.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 33\\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nThese changes did not have a material impact on regulatory capital ratios. Refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section for further\\ndetails.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for securities transactions from the settlement date to the\\ntrade date. This change was applied retrospectively, as if we had always recorded securities transactions on the trade date. As a result, there was anincrease in other assets and other liabilities due to the earlier recognition of transactions, as well as the reclassification of certain balance she et items.\\nFiscal 2023 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s accounting policy change.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the allocation of certain items from Corporate Services to the operating groups was updated to align with\\nunderlying business activity, including transfer pricing methodologies. Comparative results and ratios have been reclassified to conform with th e\\ncurrent period’s presentation.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, balances and associated revenue, expenses and provisions for credit losses related to our Canadian and\\nU.S. indirect retail auto financing business, previously reported in Personal and Commercial Banking, are reported in Corporate Services, reflect ing the\\nexit and wind-down of this business unit. Fiscal 2023 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s presentation.\\nWe analyze revenue at the consolidated level based on GAAP revenue as reported in the audited annual consolidated financial statements, rather\\nthan on a taxable equivalent basis (teb), which is consistent with our Canadian banking peer group. Like many banks, BMO analyzes revenue on a tebbasis at the operating segment level. Revenue and the provision for income taxes in BMO Capital Markets and U.S. P&C are increased on tax-exemptsecurities to equivalent pre-tax amounts in order to facilitate comparisons of income from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The offset to the segmentteb adjustments is reflected in Corporate Services revenue and provision for (recovery of) income taxes. Beginning January 1, 2024, we treatedcertain Canadian dividends in BMO Capital Markets as non-deductible for tax purposes, due to legislation that was enacted by the Canadiangovernment in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result, we no longer report this revenue on a teb basis.

Net interest income increased $809 million or 10%,\\ndue to higher balances and net interest margins. Non-interest revenue increased $71 million or 3%, primarily due to the inclusion of AIR MILES, highermutual fund distribution fee revenue and card-related revenue, partially offset by lower commercial lending fee revenue. Net interest marginof 2.77% increased 5 basis points from the prior year, due to higher loan margins and deposits growing faster than loans, partially offset by lowerdeposit margins. The impact of the transition of bankers’ acceptances exposures to loans in Commercial Banking resulted in lower non-interestrevenue offset in net interest income, with a modest reduction in the net interest margin.\\nPersonal and Business Banking revenue increased $694 million or 9%, due to higher net interest income and non-interest revenue. Commercial\\nBanking revenue increased $186 million or 6%, due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue.\\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1,659 million, an increase of $750 million from the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired\\nloans was $1,326 million, an increase of $602 million from the prior year, reflecting higher provisions in Personal and Business Banking, driven byunsecured segments of the consumer portfolio, and Commercial Banking. There was a $333 million provision for credit losses on performing loans inthe current year, compared with a $185 million provision in the prior year.\\nNon-interest expense was $5,005 million, an increase of $282 million or 6% from the prior year, reflecting the inclusion of AIR MILES, and higher\\noperating and technology costs, partially offset by severance in the prior year.\\nAverage gross loans and acceptances increased $16.8 billion or 5% from the prior year.

With inflation returning to targete d\\nlevels, the Bank of Canada lowered its key policy rate by a cumulative 125 basis points starting in June 2024, although policy rates remain restrictive .\\nGDP growth slowed slightly compared with the prior year and the unemployment rate increased by almost 1% to 6.5% as at October 2024.\\nThe higher interest rate environment continued to drive steady growth in term deposits for most of fiscal 2024, including ongoing migration from\\nchequing and savings accounts, which began to abate in recent months as interest rates declined and equity markets improved. In response to slowerhousing market activity, mortgage growth moderated from the prior year, but remained healthy, supported by robust population growth and strongcustomer acquisition. Credit card growth remained strong, supported by continued account growth and consumer spending, and higher revolvingbalances. Business lending growth eased, as clients continued to manage their balance sheets in the higher interest rate environment. Credit lossesincreased, with higher consumer delinquencies and insolvencies reflecting rising unemployment, as well as higher impairment rates for businessbanking and commercial clients.\\nThe Canadian economy is expected to expand moderately in 2025 and the Bank of Canada is anticipated to reduce interest rates by an\\nadditional 125 basis points to 2.5% by June 2025. Deposit growth is expected to continue to slow, reflecting a decrease in demand for term depositsas customers seeking higher yielding products migrate to equity markets. Mortgage growth is forecasted to gradually pick up as housing marketactivity improves and new mortgage rules take effect. Credit card growth is expected to ease from current high levels. Business lending is expectedto improve at a moderate pace in 2025 in response to lower interest rates. The lower cost of borrowing is expected to ease pressure on householdand business balance sheets through the year.\\nWe continue to invest in our business with a focus on delivering exceptional customer solutions and advice, together with leading digital\\nexperiences, and execute on our strategy to drive business growth in any environment.\\nThe Canadian economic environment in calendar 2024 and the outlook for calendar 2025 are discussed in more detail in the Economic\\nDevelopments and Outlook section.\\nCautionThis Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking section contains forward-looking statements.

U.S. GDP growth in 2024 moderated slightly from 2023, but remained strong. However, the U.S. banking industryexperienced muted loan demand and continued competition for deposits, reflecting the high interest rate environment, which increased funding cost s\\nand put pressure on net interest margins. Year-over-year growth in overall commercial loan balances decelerated in response to high interest rates,weakness in the commercial real estate market and uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election, while mortgage and home equityloans moderated amid a weaker housing market. Deposit growth improved in the second half of the year, benefitting from good customer acquisitionas a result of investments in marketing and digital capabilities. Provisions for credit losses have increased and were elevated in the second half of t he\\nyear, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates on debt servicing costs, changes in consumer preferences for products and services, and weaknes s\\nin the commercial real estate and transportation sectors.\\nThe U.S. economy is projected to grow at a healthy but more moderate pace in calendar 2025, supported by lower interest rates and\\nexpansionary fiscal policies, including a possible reduction in the corporate tax rate. The Federal Reserve lowered its key lending rate for the firs t time\\nin four years in September 2024 by 50 basis points and will likely continue to reduce rates in 2025. As a result, business and consumer lendingdemand is expected to improve through fiscal 2025 while deposit costs should stabilize. The lower cost of borrowing is expected to ease pressure onhousehold and business balance sheets.\\nLeveraging our diversified Commercial Banking franchise, an expanded Personal and Business Banking franchise and a national digital deposit\\nplatform, we are well-positioned to drive profitable growth and customer loyalty. We will remain focused on driving efficiencies by simplifying andstreamlining operations and investing in digital capabilities.\\nThe U.S. economic environment in calendar 2024 and the outlook for calendar 2025 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Developments\\nand Outlook section.\\nCautionThis U.S. Personal and Commercial Banking section contains forward-looking statements.

IFRS 17\\nprovides a comprehensive approach to accounting for all types of insurance contracts and replaced IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts. Insurance results are\\nnow presented in non-interest revenue under insurance service results and insurance investment results. As a result of the adoption and retrospecti ve\\napplication of IFRS 17 to our fiscal 2023 results, we no longer report insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities. For fu rther\\ndetails, refer to Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nReported net income was $1,248 million, an increase of $102 million or 9% from the prior year. Wealth and Asset Management reported net income\\nwas $1,012 million, an increase of $188 million or 23%, and included one additional quarter of Bank of the West results, compared with the prioryear. Insurance net income was $236 million, a decrease of $86 million or 27%.\\nTotal revenue was $5,646 million, an increase of $235 million or 4%. Revenue in Wealth and Asset Management was $5,279 million, an increase\\nof $349 million or 7%, due to growth in client assets, including the impact of stronger global markets, and higher revenue from online brokeragetransactions, partially offset by lower net interest income due to lower margins. Insurance revenue was $367 million, a decrease of $114 million,reflecting changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS 17.\\nThe total provision for credit losses was $31 million, compared with an $18 million provision in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on\\nimpaired loans increased $21 million and the provision for credit losses on performing loans decreased $8 million.\\nNon-interest expense was $3,968 million, an increase of $90 million or 2% from the prior year, due to higher revenue-based costs and our\\ninvestment in talent, partially offset by operational efficiencies.\\nAssets under management increased $89.8 billion or 27% from the prior year to $422.7 billion, driven by stronger global markets and higher net\\nclient assets. Assets under administration decreased $55.1 billion or 13% to $361.2 billion, primarily due to the exit of our Institutional Trust Ser vices\\noperations in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by stronger global markets. Average gross loans increased 5% and average deposits we re\\nrelatively unchanged from the prior year.\\nFor further information on non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios in this 2024 Operating Groups Performance Review section, refer to the\\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\\nBMO Wealth Management results benefitted from growing momentum in equity markets through fiscal 2024, with a moderation of inflationarypressures and declining interest rates in the second half of the year. Higher assets under management from stronger global markets and net newasset flows supported revenue growth, offsetting the industry-wide reduction in asset yields and lower net interest margins from deposit migrationto higher yielding assets.

All periodsincluded acquisition and integration costs, as well as the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which increased in fiscal 2023, due to\\nthe acquisition of Bank of the West.\\nFinancial performance benefitted from the strength and diversification of our businesses. Results were impacted by a higher interest rate\\nenvironment and uncertain economic conditions resulting in higher credit provisions, slower loan demand and lower levels of client activity in ourmarket-sensitive businesses.\\nRevenue growth in Canadian P&C reflected good customer acquisition and volume growth and higher net interest margins. U.S. P&C revenue\\nperformance benefitted from the inclusion of Bank of the West; however, recent quarters have been impacted by a more muted U.S. bankingenvironment, with reduced loan demand and higher deposit costs. Revenue in BMO Wealth Management benefitted from steady growth in clientassets, including the impact of improved global markets in fiscal 2024, while high interest rates resulted in a shift in deposit mix to term deposits an d\\nreduced margins. Insurance revenue is subject to variability resulting from market-related impacts, including changes in portfolio positioning d uring\\nthe transition to IFRS 17.

Adjusted results excluded the specified items noted in the Summary Quarterly Earnings Trends section.\\nReported net income increased from the prior year, primarily due to the reversal of the fiscal 2022 legal provision, including accrued interest, and\\nlower acquisition and integration costs, compared with the prior year. The decrease in adjusted net income reflected a higher provision for creditlosses, partially offset by lower expenses, with revenue relatively unchanged from the prior year. Reported and adjusted net income decreased acros s\\nall operating segments. Corporate Services recorded net income on a reported basis, compared with a net loss in the prior year, and a lower net losson an adjusted basis.\\nRevenue\\nReported revenue was $8,957 million, an increase of $638 million or 8% from the prior year, due to the reversal of accrued interest on the legalprovision in the current year. Adjusted revenue was $8,368 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year, with higher non-interest revenuepartially offset by lower net interest income. Adjusted net interest income decreased, primarily due to lower trading-related net interest income a nd\\nlower net interest income in Corporate Services due to lower net accretion of purchase accounting fair value marks, partially offset by higher netinterest income in Canadian P&C due to higher balances and higher non-trading interest income in BMO Capital Markets. Non-interest revenueincreased, primarily driven by higher trading revenue, investment management and custodial fee revenue and mutual fund fee revenue, partiallyoffset by lower insurance-related revenue reflecting changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS 17, the impact of mark-downs onthe held-for-sale loan portfolio and lower lending fee revenue, largely offset in net interest income reflecting the transition of bankers’ accepta nces\\nexposures to loans, and lower card fee revenue.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 53\\n\\n\\n## Page 42', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 4, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667285', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 42\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nProvision for Credit Losses\\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1,523 million, compared with a provision of $446 million in the prior year. Total provision for credit losses as a\\npercentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 91 basis points, compared with 27 basis points in the prior year. The provision for creditlosses on impaired loans was $1,107 million, an increase of $699 million, due to higher provisions across operating segments, primarily in the U.S.corporate and commercial portfolio, and in the Canadian unsecured segments of the consumer portfolio. The provision for credit losses on impairedloans as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 66 basis points, compared with 25 basis points in the prior year. There wasa $416 million provision for credit losses on performing loans, compared with a $38 million provision in the prior year, primarily driven by portfoliocredit migration, as well as uncertainty in credit conditions.\\nNon-Interest Expense\\nReported non-interest expense was $4,427 million, a decrease of $1,252 million or 22% from the prior year, and adjusted non-interest expensewas $4,876 million, a decrease of $100 million or 2%. Reported results reflected the reversal of the legal provision and the impact of loweracquisition and integration costs in the current year. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased, primarily due to our continued focus on operationa l\\nefficiencies, including realized cost synergies related to Bank of the West, and lower premises costs, including the charge in the prior year related to\\nthe consolidation of BMO real estate, and other operating costs.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThe reported provision for income taxes was $703 million, an increase of $219 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and the adjustedprovision for income taxes was $427 million, a decrease of $241 million. The reported effective tax rate was 23.4%, compared with 22.1% in thefourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7%, compared with 22.9%. The change in the reported effective tax raterelative to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the impact of higher income in the current year, and the change in the adjusted effectivetax rate was primarily due to earnings mix, including the impact of lower income in the current quarter.\\nQ4 2024 vs. Q3 2024\\nReported net income increased $439 million or 24% from the prior quarter, and adjusted net income decreased $439 million or 22%. Reported netincome increased primarily due to the reversal of the legal provision. The decrease in adjusted net income reflected a higher provision for creditlosses and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenue. Reported and adjusted net income decreased across all operating segments. Corporat e\\nServices recorded net income on a reported basis, compared with a net loss in the prior quarter, and a lower net loss on an adjusted basis. Reportedrevenue increased $765 million or 9% from the prior quarter, and adjusted revenue increased $162 million or 2%. Reported revenue reflected highernet interest income, primarily driven by the reversal of accrued interest on the legal provision. Reported and adjusted revenue reflected higher netinterest income, driven by higher Corporate Services and Canadian P&C net interest income, as well as higher non-trading interest income in BMOCapital Markets, partially offset by lower trading-related net interest income, and higher non-interest revenue, driven by higher trading revenue and\\nunderwriting and advisory fee revenue, partially offset by lower card and lending fee revenue. Reported non-interest expense decreased $412 millio n\\nor 9% from the prior quarter, due to the reversal of the legal provision, and adjusted non-interest expense increased $179 million or 4%, primarilydue to higher professional fees and higher association, clearing and annual regulator fees. Total provision for credit losses increased $617 millio n\\nfrom the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans increased $279 million, due to higher provisions in the corporate andcommercial portfolio.

In addition, we completed the acquisition of the AIR MILES Reward Program (AIR MILES) on June 1, 2023, which contributed to theincrease in revenue and expenses in our Canadian P&C business beginning the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\\nPrior to November 1, 2022, we presented revenue on a basis net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities\\n(CCPB). Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we no longer report CCPB, given the adoption and retrospective application of IFRS 17, Insurance\\nContracts (IFRS 17).

The decrease in reported results primarily reflected actions to manage the impact of interest ratechanges between the announcement and closing of the Bank of the West acquisition on its fair value and goodwill which resulted in a net loss infiscal 2023, compared with a net gain in fiscal 2022, and the impact of a lawsuit associated with a predecessor bank, M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank, infiscal 2022, partially offset by higher acquisition and integration costs, an initial provision for credit losses on the purchased Bank of the West lo an\\nportfolio, as well as higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to the Bank of the West acquisition in fiscal 2023, and th e\\nimpact of certain tax measures enacted by the Canadian government.\\nAdjusted net income decreased, as the inclusion of Bank of the West and higher underlying revenue were more than offset by higher expenses\\nand a higher provision for credit losses. Reported and adjusted net income increased in U.S. P&C and decreased in BMO Wealth Management,Canadian P&C and BMO Capital Markets. On a reported basis, Corporate Services recorded a net loss in fiscal 2023, compared with net income infiscal 2022, primarily due to the items noted above. On an adjusted basis, Corporate Services recorded a higher net loss.\\nRevenue\\nReported revenue in fiscal 2023 was $29,259 million, a decrease of $4,451 million or 13% from fiscal 2022, primarily due to the impact of fair valuemanagement actions and interest expense related to the legal provision, as noted above. On an adjusted basis, and net of insurance claims,commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB) in fiscal 2022, revenue increased $4,905 million, due to the inclusion of Bank of the Wes t\\nand AIR MILES, as well as higher revenue in Canadian P&C and BMO Capital Markets.\\nProvision for Credit Losses\\nThe total provision for credit losses (PCL) in fiscal 2023 was $2,178 million on a reported basis and $1,473 million on an adjusted basis, comparedwith $313 million on both a reported and an adjusted basis in fiscal 2022. PCL on impaired loans was $1,180 million in fiscal 2023, an increaseof $678 million from fiscal 2022, with higher provisions across all businesses. PCL on performing loans in fiscal 2023 was $998 million on a reportedbasis, including the initial provision of $705 million on the purchased Bank of the West performing loan portfolio, and $293 million on an adjustedbasis, compared with a reported and an adjusted recovery of credit losses of $189 million in fiscal 2022.\\nNon-Interest Expense\\nReported non-interest expense in fiscal 2023 was $21,134 million, an increase of $4,940 million or 31% from fiscal 2022, and adjusted non-interestexpense was $18,713 million, an increase of $3,519 million or 23% from fiscal 2022. Reported non-interest expense in fiscal 2023 included higheracquisition and integration costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, compared with fiscal 2022, partially offset by the l ower\\nlegal expense related to the lawsuit associated with M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank. Reported and adjusted non-interest expense increased, primarilydue to the inclusion of Bank of the West, as well as higher employee-related, technology, advertising and business development costs, and legalprovisions in fiscal 2023.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThe provision for income taxes in fiscal 2023 was $1,510 million, compared with $4,349 million in fiscal 2022. The reported effective tax rate infiscal 2023 was 25.4%, compared with 24.3% in fiscal 2022, with the increase primarily due to the impact of certain Canadian tax measures duringthe 2023 fiscal year. The adjusted provision for income taxes in fiscal 2023 was $2,517 million, compared with $2,670 million in fiscal 2022. Theadjusted effective tax rate was 22.4% in fiscal 2023, compared with 22.8% in fiscal 2022.\\n56BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 45\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Financial Condition Review\\nSummary Balance Sheet\\nTABLE 24\\n(Canadian $ in millions)\\nAs at October 31 2024 2023\\nAssets\\nCash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits with banks 68,738 82,043\\nSecurities 396,880 320,084\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements 110,907 115,662\\nNet loans 678,016 656,665\\nDerivative instruments 47,253 39,976\\nOther assets 107,853 132,576\\nTotal assets 1,409,647 1,347,006\\nLiabilities and Equity\\nDeposits 982,440 910,879\\nDerivative instruments 58,303 50,193\\nSecurities lent or sold under repurchase agreements 110,791 106,108\\nOther liabilities 165,450 195,475\\nSubordinated debt 8,377 8,228\\nEquity 84,250 76,095\\nNon-controlling interest in subsidiaries 36 28\\nTotal liabilities and equity 1,409,647 1,347,006\\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified for changes in accounting policy.\\nOverview\\nTotal assets of $1,409.6 billion increased $62.6 billion from October 31, 2023.

Details on our enterprise-wide capital management practices and strategies can be found below.\\nEnterprise-Wide Capital Management\\nCapital Management\\nObjective\\nBMO is committed to a disciplined approach to capital management that balances the interests and requirements of our shareholders, regulators,depositors, fixed income investors and rating agencies. We recognize the global trend of rising regulatory capital requirements, and manage ourcapital position accordingly. Our objective is to maintain a strong and optimized capital position in a cost-effective structure that:\\n‰Is appropriate given BMO’s target regulatory capital ratios and internal assessment of economic capital requirements\\n‰Underpins BMO’s operating groups’ business strategies and considers the market environment\\n‰Supports depositor, investor and regulator confidence, and dividends, while building long-term shareholder value\\n‰Is consistent with BMO’s target credit ratings.\\nFramework\\nCapital Supply\\nCapital available\\nto support risksCapital Demand\\nCapital required to support\\nthe risks underlying our\\nbusiness activitiesCapital adequacy\\nassessment of capital\\ndemand and supply\\nThe principles and key elements of our capital management framework are outlined in our Capital Management Corporate Policy and in the annual\\ncapital plan, which includes the results of the comprehensive Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\\nICAAP is an integrated process that involves the application of stress testing and other tools to assess capital adequacy on both a regulatory and\\nan economic basis. The results of this process inform and support the establishment of capital targets and the implementation of capital strategiesthat take into consideration the strategic direction and risk appetite of the enterprise. The annual capital plan is developed considering the resul ts of\\nICAAP and in conjunction with the annual business plan, promoting alignment between business and risk strategies, regulatory and economic capitalrequirements and the availability of capital. Enterprise-wide stress testing and scenario analysis are conducted in order to assess the impact of va rious\\nstress conditions on our risk profile and capital requirements.\\nOur capital management framework seeks to ensure that the bank is adequately capitalized given the risks we assume in the normal course of\\nbusiness, as well as under stress, and supports the determination of limits, targets and performance measures that are applied in managing balancesheet positions, risk levels and capital requirements at the consolidated entity, legal entity and operating group levels. We seek to optimize ourcapital through efficient use of our balance sheet and the related risks we undertake, and may employ levers such as risk transfer transactions andthe sale of assets. We evaluate assessments of actual and forecasted capital adequacy against our capital targets throughout the year, includingconsideration of changes in our business activities and risk profile, the operating environment, our competitors, and current and future regulator y\\nexpectations.\\nWe allocate capital to operating groups in order to evaluate business performance, and we consider capital implications in our strategic, tactical\\nand transactional decision-making. By allocating capital to operating groups, setting and monitoring capital limits and metrics, and measuring th e\\ngroups’ performance against these limits and metrics, we seek to optimize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, while maintaining awell-capitalized position.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 59\\n\\n\\n## Page 48\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nThis approach is intended to protect interested parties from the risks inherent in our various businesses, while still providing the flexibility to\\ndeploy resources in support of strategic growth activities and to maintain dividends.\\nRefer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section for further discussion of the risks underlying our business.\\nGovernance\\nThe Board of Directors, either directly or through its Risk Review Committee, provides ultimate oversight and approval of capital management,including the bank’s Capital Management Corporate Policy, capital plan and capital adequacy assessments. The Board of Directors regularly reviewsthe bank’s capital position and key capital management activities. In addition, the capital adequacy assessment results determined by ICAAP areapproved by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Risk Review Committee. The Enterprise Capital Management Committee providessenior management oversight, including the review of significant capital management policies, issues and activities, and the capital required tosupport the execution of our enterprise-wide strategy. Finance and Risk Management are responsible for the design and implementation of ourcorporate policies and frameworks related to capital and risk management, as well as ICAAP. The Corporate Audit Division, as the third line ofdefence, verifies adherence to controls and identifies opportunities to strengthen our processes. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk ManagementFramework section for further discussion.\\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\\nRegulatory capital requirements for BMO are determined in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI, which are based on the Basel III frameworkdeveloped by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The current minimum risk-based capital ratios set out in OSFI’s Capital AdequacyRequirements (CAR) Guideline are a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 6.0% and a Total Capital Ratio of 8.0%. Inaddition to these minimum capital requirements, OSFI also requires domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), including BMO, to hold Pillar 1and Pillar 2 buffers, which are meant to be used as a normal first response in periods of stress. Pillar 1 buffers include a capital conservation bufferof 2.5%, a D-SIB Common Equity Tier 1 surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer, which can range from 0% to 2.5%, depending on a bank’sexposure to jurisdictions that have activated the buffer. If a bank’s capital ratios fall below the range of the combined minimum and Pillar 1 buffers,restrictions on discretionary distributions of earnings (such as dividends, share repurchases and discretionary compensation) could ensue, with the\\ndegree of such restrictions varying according to the position of the bank’s ratios. Pillar 2 buffers address risks associated with systemic vulnerab ilities\\nand include the domestic stability buffer (DSB), which can range from 0% to 4.0% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and was 3.5% as atOctober 31, 2024. The buffer level is set twice a year by OSFI, in June and December, but OSFI can make a change at any time when needed. UnderOSFI guidelines, breaches of the DSB do not automatically result in constraints on capital distributions. In the event of a breach, OSFI would require a\\nremediation plan and would expect the plan to be executed in a timely manner. Banks may be required to hold additional regulatory buffers that areapplicable to the capital ratios, the Leverage and the Total Loss Absorbing Capital (TLAC) Ratios.\\nTLAC comprises the aggregate of Total Capital and Other TLAC instruments that allow conversion, in whole or in part, into common shares under\\ntheCanada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act and meet the eligibility criteria under the TLAC Guideline.

Canada\\nDeposit Insurance Corporation has the power to trigger the conversion of bail-in debt into common shares. This statutory conversion supplementsNVCC securities, which must be converted in full prior to the conversion of bail-in debt.\\nRisk-Weighted Assets\\nRisk-weighted assets (RWA) measure a bank’s exposures, weighted for their relative risk and calculated in accordance with the regulatory capitalrules prescribed by OSFI, which include standardized and internal ratings or internal model approaches for credit and market risk, and standardizedapproaches for operational risk.\\nWe primarily use the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach to determine credit RWA in our portfolio. The IRB Approach includes the Foundation\\n(FIRB) Approach for exposures to financial institutions and large corporate portfolios, and the Advanced (AIRB) Approach for all other exposures. T he\\nAIRB Approach applies sophisticated techniques to measure RWA at the exposure level based on sound risk management principles, includingestimates of the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) risk parameters, as well as term to maturity and\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 61\\n\\n\\n## Page 50', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 5, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667300', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 50\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nasset class type, as prescribed by the OSFI rules. These risk parameters are determined using internal models that leverage historical portfolio dat a\\nsupplemented by benchmarking, as appropriate, and are updated periodically. Validation procedures related to these models are in place in order toquantify and differentiate risks appropriately. The FIRB Approach employs the same internal PD estimates as the AIRB Approach, but LGD and EADparameters are prescribed by OSFI. Credit risk RWA related to certain Canadian and U.S. portfolios are determined under the Standardized Approachusing prescribed risk weights based on external ratings, counterparty type or product type. These portfolios reflect current waivers and exemption st o\\nthe IRB Approach approved by OSFI. For further discussion of these respective approaches noted above, refer to the Credit and Counterparty Risk –Credit and Counterparty Risk Measurement section.\\nWe use the Standardized Approach for determining market risk and operational risk capital requirements.In calculating regulatory capital ratios, total RWA must be increased when the capital floor amount calculated under the standardized approaches,\\nmultiplied by a capital floor adjustment factor, is higher than a similar calculation using the more risk-sensitive internal modelled approaches, w here\\napplicable. Other than during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the capital floor was not operative for BMO in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\\nRegulatory Capital Developments\\nThe revised CAR Guideline, published by OSFI in October 2023, was effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and includes heightened regulatorycapital requirements for mortgages with growing balances where payments are insufficient to cover the interest component, as well as otherchanges that provide further clarification on the application of the guideline.\\nEffective November 1, 2023, the DSB was raised from 3.0% to 3.5% of total RWA.The domestic implementation of the Basel III Reforms related to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, along with an increase in the\\ncapital floor adjustment from 65.0% to 67.5%, became effective the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On July 5, 2024, OSFI announced a one-year delay inthe next increase of the capital floor adjustment factor to allow OSFI time to consider the impact of the implementation of Basel III reforms in otherjurisdictions. With the one-year delay, the adjustment factor will remain at the current 67.5% for fiscal 2025 and will then rise by an additional 2.5%to 70.0% in fiscal 2026 and 72.5% in fiscal 2027.\\nThe Parental Stand-Alone (Solo) TLAC Framework for D-SIBs, published by OSFI on September 12, 2023, was effective in the first quarter of\\nfiscal 2024. The purpose of the Solo framework is to ensure a non-viable D-SIB has sufficient loss absorbing capacity on a stand-alone legal entitybasis to support its resolution, which would, in turn, facilitate an orderly resolution of the D-SIB while minimizing adverse impacts on the stabilit yo f\\nthe financial sector, ensuring the continuity of critical functions and minimizing taxpayers’ exposure to loss. We exceeded the minimum Solo TLACrequirement of 21.5%.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17). Upon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily\\nchanged our accounting policy for the measurement of investment properties under IAS 40, Investment Properties (IAS 40), recorded in insurance-\\nrelated assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, from cost value to fair value. This change did not have a material impact on regulatory capitalratios. Refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section for further details.\\nRegulatory Capital and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity Review\\nBMO is well-capitalized, with capital ratios that exceed OSFI’s published requirements for large Canadian banks, including a DSB of 3.5%. OurCET1 Ratio was 13.6% as at October 31, 2024, compared with 12.5% as at October 31, 2023. Our CET1 Ratio increased from the prior year, primarily asa result of internal capital generation, common shares issued under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (DRIP) andlower source-currency RWA. There was a positive impact to the ratio from the reversal of a fiscal 2022 legal provision associated with a predecessorbank, M&I Marshal and Ilsley Bank, which increased internal capital generation and reduced RWA.\\nOur Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital Ratios were 15.4% and 17.6%, respectively, as at October 31, 2024, compared with 14.1% and 16.2%,\\nrespectively, as at October 31, 2023. The Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital Ratios were higher, due to the same factors impacting the CET1 Ratio, as wellas the issuances of Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCN) totalling US$1.75 billion, partially offset by preferred share redemptions.\\nThe impact of foreign exchange movements on BMO’s capital ratios was largely offset. BMO’s investments in foreign operations are primarily\\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and the foreign exchange impact of U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA and capital deductions may result in variability in thebank’s capital ratios. We manage the impact of foreign exchange movements on RWA and capital deductions in our capital ratios.\\nOur Leverage Ratio was 4.4% as at October 31, 2024, an increase from 4.2% as at October 31, 2023, driven by higher Tier 1 Capital, partially\\noffset by higher leverage exposures.\\nAs at October 31, 2024, our TLAC Ratio was 29.3% and our TLAC Leverage Ratio was 8.3%, compared with 27.0% and 8.1%, respectively, as at\\nOctober 31, 2023.\\nWhile the ratios discussed above reflect our consolidated capital base, we conduct business through a variety of corporate structures, including\\nsubsidiaries. A framework is in place such that capital and funding are managed appropriately at the subsidiary level.\\nFollowing the acquisition of Bank of the West in fiscal 2023, our U.S. bank intermediate holding company BMO Financial Corp. (BFC) became a\\nCategory III institution under the Enhanced Prudential Standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). BFC is required to meet certainheightened regulatory standards related to capital, liquidity and risk management, including complying with FRB single counterparty credit limit s. BFC\\nis also subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST) requirements of the FRB on an\\nannual basis.\\nOn June 26, 2024, the FRB released its 2024 CCAR and DFAST results, and on August 28, 2024 announced individual large bank capital\\nrequirements, which were effective October 1, 2024. For BFC, the FRB determined a CET1 Ratio requirement of 10.0%, including the 4.5% minimumCET1 Ratio and a 5.5% stress capital buffer. BFC is well-capitalized, with a CET1 Ratio of 11.8% as at September 30, 2024.\\n62BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 51\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Regulatory Capital and TLAC(1)\\nTABLE 30\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted)\\nAs at October 31 2024 2023\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital: Instruments and Reserves\\nDirectly issued qualifying common share capital plus related stock surplus 24,275 23,269\\nRetained earnings 46,469 44,920\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (and other reserves) 5,419 1,862\\nGoodwill and other intangibles (net of related tax liability) (20,349) (20,899)\\nOther common equity Tier 1 capital deductions 1,240 3,762\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) 57,054 52,914\\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital: Instruments\\nDirectly issued qualifying Additional Tier 1 instruments plus related stock surplus 7,787 6,958\\nTotal regulatory adjustments applied to Additional Tier 1 Capital (106) (87)\\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital (AT1) 7,681 6,871\\nTier 1 Capital (T1 = CET1 + AT1) 64,735 59,785\\nTier 2 Capital: Instruments and Provisions\\nDirectly issued qualifying Tier 2 instruments plus related stock surplus 8,230 8,082\\nGeneral allowance 954 902\\nTotal regulatory adjustments to Tier 2 Capital (8) (51)\\nTier 2 Capital (T2) 9,176 8,933\\nTotal Capital (TC = T1 + T2) 73,911 68,718\\nNon-Regulatory Capital Elements of TLAC\\nDirectly issued qualifying Other TLAC instruments 49,465 45,773\\nTotal regulatory adjustments applied to Other TLAC (88) (89)\\nOther TLAC 49,377 45,684\\nTLAC (TLAC = TC + Other TLAC) 123,288 114,402\\nRisk-Weighted Assets and Leverage Ratio Exposures\\nRisk-Weighted Assets 420,838 424,197\\nLeverage Ratio Exposures 1,484,962 1,413,036\\nCapital Ratios (%)\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio 13.6 12.5\\nTier 1 Capital Ratio 15.4 14.1\\nTotal Capital Ratio 17.6 16.2\\nTLAC Ratio 29.3 27.0\\nLeverage Ratio 4.4 4.2\\nTLAC Leverage Ratio 8.3 8.1\\n(1) Calculated in accordance with OSFI’s CAR Guideline and LR Guideline, as applicable.

Based on a floor price of $5.00, these NVCC instruments would be converted intoapproximately 4.2 billion BMO common shares, assuming no accrued interest and no declared and unpaid dividends.\\nFurther details on subordinated debt and share capital are provided in Notes 16 and 17 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nDividends\\nDividends per common share declared in fiscal 2024 totalled $6.12, an increase of 6% from the prior year. Annual dividends declaredrepresented 64% of reported net income and 63% of adjusted net income available to common shareholders on a last twelve-month basis.\\nOur target dividend payout range (common share dividends as a percentage of net income available to shareholders, less preferred share\\ndividends and distributions on other equity instruments, based on earnings over the last twelve months) is 40% to 50%, providing shareholders witha competitive dividend yield. Our target dividend payout range seeks to provide shareholders with stable income, while retaining sufficient earnin gs\\nto support anticipated business growth, fund strategic investments and support capital adequacy.\\nAt year-end, our common shares provided an annualized dividend yield of 5% based on the year-end closing share price. On December 5, 2024,\\nwe announced that the Board of Directors had declared a quarterly dividend on common shares of $1.59 per share, an increase of $0.04 per sharefrom the prior quarter and 5% from the prior year. The dividend is payable on February 26, 2025 to shareholders of record on January 30, 2025.\\nShareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan\\nCommon shareholders may elect to have their cash dividends reinvested in common shares of BMO, in accordance with the DRIP.\\nIn the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024, common shares to supply the DRIP were issued from treasury at a 2% discount, calculated in\\naccordance with the terms of the DRIP. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, and until further notice, common shares to supply the DRIP will bepurchased on the open market without a discount. During fiscal 2023, common shares to supply the DRIP were issued from treasury at a 2% discount,calculated in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.\\nEligible Dividends Designation\\nFor the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any similar provincial and territorial legislation, BMO designates all dividends paid or deemed to\\nbe paid on both its common and preferred shares as “eligible dividends”, unless indicated otherwise.\\nCautionThis Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Sta tements.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nWe enter into a number of off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations, and these include structured entities (SEs), credit\\ninstruments and guarantees.\\nStructured Entities and Securitization\\nWe carry out certain business activities through arrangements involving SEs, using them to obtain sources of liquidity and manage capital bysecuritizing certain of our financial assets, to secure customer transactions, or to pass our credit risk exposure to holders of the vehicles’ securi ties. For\\nexample, we enter into transactions with SEs in which we transfer assets, including mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans,real estate lines of credit, auto loans and equipment loans, in order to obtain alternate sources of funding or as part of our trading activities. Note 6 of\\nthe audited annual consolidated financial statements describes the loan securitization activities carried out through third-party programs such as the\\nCanada Mortgage Bond Program and the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities Program. Note 7 of the audited annual consolidatedfinancial statements provides further details of our interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs. Under IFRS, we consolidate a SE if wecontrol the entity. We consolidate our own securitization vehicles, certain capital and funding vehicles, and other structured entities created to meet\\nour customers’ needs, as well as our own. We do not consolidate our customer securitization vehicles, certain capital vehicles, various BMO-managedfunds or various other SEs where investments are held. Further details on our customer securitization vehicles are provided below.\\nBMO-Sponsored Securitization Vehicles\\nWe sponsor various vehicles that fund assets originated either by us (which are then securitized through a bank securitization vehicle) or by ourcustomers (which are then securitized through three Canadian customer securitization vehicles and one U.S. customer securitization vehicle). We e arn\\nfees for providing services related to these customer securitization vehicles, including liquidity, distribution and financial arrangement fees for\\nsupporting the ongoing operations of the vehicles. These fees totalled approximately $160 million in fiscal 2024 ($149 million in fiscal 2023).\\nCustomer Securitization Vehicles\\nOur customer securitization vehicles provide customers with access to financing either from us or from the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP)markets. Customers sell either their assets or an interest in their assets into these vehicles, which then issue ABCP either to investors or to us, inorder to fund the purchases. The sellers remain responsible for servicing the transferred assets and are first to absorb any losses realized on thoseassets. We are not responsible for servicing or absorbing the first loss and none of the sellers are affiliated with BMO.\\nOur exposure to potential losses arises from the purchase of ABCP issued by the vehicles, any related derivative contracts entered into with the\\nvehicles, and the liquidity support provided to the market-funded vehicles. We use the credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enter intothese arrangements, just as we do when extending credit in the form of a loan.\\n66BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 55\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Three of these customer securitization vehicles are market-funded, while the fourth is funded directly by the bank. We do not control these\\nentities and therefore they are not consolidated. Further information on the consolidation of customer securitization vehicles is provided in Note 7o f\\nthe audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe market-funded vehicles had a total of $11.2 billion of ABCP outstanding as at October 31, 2024 ($12.2 billion as at October 31, 2023). The\\nABCP issued by the Canadian market-funded vehicles is rated R-1 (high) by DBRS and P1 by Moody’s, and the ABCP issued by the U.S. market-fundedvehicle is rated A1 by S&P and P1 by Moody’s. Our holdings of ABCP, as distributing agent of ABCP issued by the market-funded vehicles,totalled $170 million as at October 31, 2024 ($518 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nWe provide liquidity facilities to the market-funded vehicles, which may require that we provide additional financing to the vehicles should\\ncertain events occur. The total committed and undrawn amount under these liquidity facilities and the undrawn amount of the BMO funded vehiclesas at October 31, 2024 totalled $19.3 billion ($19.8 billion as at October 31, 2023). This amount comprises part of the commitments outlined inNote 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe assets of each of these market-funded vehicles consist primarily of exposures to diversified pools of automobile-related receivables and\\nconventional residential mortgages in Canada, and automobile-related receivables and equipment loans in the United States. These two asset classe s\\nrepresent 67% (63% in fiscal 2023) in Canada, and 86% (unchanged from 2023) in the United States, of the aggregate assets of their respectivevehicles as at October 31, 2024, and as at October 31, 2023, respectively.\\nGuarantees and Other Credit Instruments\\nTo meet the financial needs of our clients, we use a variety of guarantees and commitments. Guarantees include contracts under which we may berequired to make payments to a counterparty based on changes in the value of an asset, liability or equity security that the counterparty holds.Contracts under which we may be required to make payments if a third party does not perform according to the terms of a contract, and contractsunder which we provide indirect guarantees of indebtedness, are also considered guarantees. In the normal course of business, the types ofguarantee products we offer include letters of credit, derivatives contracts or instruments (including, but not limited to, credit default swaps), as well\\nas indemnification agreements. The maximum amount payable by BMO in relation to these guarantees was $47 billion as at October 31, 2024($40 billion as at October 31, 2023).\\nOther credit commitments are off-balance sheet arrangements that represent our commitment to customers to grant them credit in the form of\\nloans or other financings for specific amounts and maturities, subject to certain conditions. These include backstop liquidity facilities, docume ntary and\\ncommercial letters of credit, and commitments to extend credit. The maximum amount payable by BMO in relation to these other creditcommitments was $261 billion as at October 31, 2024 ($249 billion as at October 31, 2023).\\nThere is a large number of credit instruments outstanding at any time. The amount above is not representative of our likely credit exposure or\\nthe liquidity requirements for these instruments, as it does not take into account customer behaviour, which suggests that only a portion of ourcustomers would utilize the facilities related to these instruments, nor does it take into account any amounts that could be recovered under recourseand collateral provisions. Our customers are broadly diversified, and we do not anticipate events or conditions that would cause a significant numbe r\\nof customers to fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We use the credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enterinto these arrangements, just as we do when extending credit in the form of a loan. We monitor off-balance sheet credit instruments in order toavoid undue concentrations in any geographic region or industry.\\nFor the credit commitments outlined in the preceding paragraphs, in the absence of an event that triggers a default, early termination by BMO\\nmay result in a breach of contract.\\nFurther information on these instruments can be found in Note 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nCautionThis Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section contains forward-looking statements.

A disciplined and integratedapproach to managing risk is fundamental to the success of our operations. Our risk management framework providesindependent risk oversight across the enterprise and is integral to building competitive advantage.\\nEnterprise-Wide Risk Management outlines BMO’s approach to managing the key financial risks and other related risks that are inherent in these\\nbusiness activities, as discussed in the following sections:\\n68 Risks That May Affect Future Results\\n72 Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework77 Credit and Counterparty Risk85 Market Risk90 Insurance Risk91 Liquidity and Funding Risk100 Operational Non-Financial Risk\\n104 Legal and Regulatory Risk107 Strategic Risk107 Environmental and Social Risk109 Reputation Risk\\nText and tables presented in a blue-tinted font in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section of the MD&A form an integral part of the 2024 audited ann ual consolidated\\nfinancial statements. They present required disclosures as set out by the International Accounting Standards Board in IFRS 7, Financial Instruments – Disclosures, which\\npermits cross-referencing between the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the MD&A. Refer to Notes 1 and 5 of the audited annual consol idated financial\\nstatements.\\nRisks That May Affect Future Results\\nTop and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results\\nBMO’s overall risk profile can be impacted by evolving internal and external events. These events have the potential to affect our business and our\\noperational and financial results. Our risk management life cycle is a continuous process designed to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report o n\\nrisks arising from these events. These event-related risks are raised for discussion with the Board of Directors, senior management and businessleaders at several forums, incorporating both bottom-up and top-down approaches. Risks are examined and assessed by scenario analysis. Ourexposure to certain events is addressed through action plans developed based on these risk assessments.\\nThe following risks are considered to have the potential to materially impact BMO’s financial results, operational efficiency, strategic directio n\\nor reputation.\\nGeneral Economic Conditions\\nThe prevailing economic conditions in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business affect our financial results an d\\nbusiness operations. These conditions include the level of economic growth, interest rates and central bank actions, inflation, labour markets andunemployment rates, and the activity level and volatility of financial markets. The Canadian economy lost momentum in fiscal 2024, in response tohigher interest rates, but has shown continued resilience as a result of high levels of household savings, expansionary fiscal policies, and robustpopulation growth driven by immigration. Changes to Canada’s immigration policies are expected to slow population growth. Although the labourmarket has weakened in both countries, employment growth remains positive. Inflation has moderated, although some price pressures in theservices sector persist. The inflation rate has continued to moderate after reaching a four-decade high in fiscal 2022 in response to weaker labourmarkets, lower commodity prices and improved global supply chains. Policy rates are easing in Canada and the United States; however, longer-termborrowing costs, though falling, remain elevated. With the upcoming renegotiation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Trade Agreement in 2026,there is a risk that the free trade agreement may end, which could result in disruptive and costly tariffs on trade flows among the three nations.These factors represent risks for market stability and economic growth. Changes in economic conditions can affect consumer spending, housingprices, business investment and capital markets activity, and in turn, affect our business, including the demand for our lending and deposit product s,\\nnet interest income, fee revenue, operating expenses, credit losses and asset values. In fiscal 2024, the above factors had, and may continue to have,an impact on consumers and the operations of our clients, as well as a negative effect on our earnings, including lower loan and deposit demand, andhigher provisions for credit losses.\\nManagement regularly monitors the economic environment in which we operate, in order to identify significant changes in key economic\\nindicators, so that we can assess BMO’s portfolio and business strategies, and develop contingency plans to address any adverse developments.\\n68BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 57', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 6, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667311', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 57\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Cyber and Information Security Risk\\nCyber and information security risk arises from the ever-increasing reliance of our business operations on internet and cloud technologies, anddependence on advanced digital technologies to process data, combined with a hybrid work environment. In addition, rising geopolitical tensions ar e\\ncontributing to increasing global exposures to cyber security risks. These risks could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of BM O’s data\\nand information across our businesses and customer base. We are the target of attempted cyber attacks and must continuously monitor and developour systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure, as well as access to and the security of our data. Any resulti ng\\ndata breaches may lead to exposure or loss of data, including customer or employee information and the bank’s strategic or other sensitive internalinformation, and could result in identity theft, fraud or business losses. Cyber attacks could result in system failures and disruption of services, and\\nexpose the bank to litigation and regulatory risk, as well as reputational harm. Threat campaigns are becoming more sophisticated and well-organized, and often take place through third-party suppliers, which can negatively impact our business, brand and reputation, as well as customerretention and acquisition.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s cyber and information security program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nTechnology Resilience and Innovation Risk\\nTechnology resilience risk arises from a failure to maintain acceptable service levels during, as well as after, severe disruptions to critical proc esses\\nand the supporting information technology systems. Technology resilience risk exposure is increasing and driving new and more extensive regulator y\\nobligations and customer expectations related to operational resilience. This exposure challenges banks to extend their programs beyond disasterrecovery and business continuity activities, to include responses to internal and external threats of disruption. Technology resilience is critic al to\\nproviding our customers with a consistent online experience across our digital channels. Given the increasing reliance of our customers on technolo gy\\nplatforms to manage and support their personal, business and investment banking activities, it is important that we maintain platforms that functio n\\nat high levels of operational reliability and resilience, in order to protect and ensure the availability, integrity and recoverability of critical data,\\nparticularly with respect to business-critical systems.\\nTechnologies continue to evolve rapidly and are creating competitive pressures across the industry. Innovation risk is the inability to deliver new\\ntechnology solutions, services, processes and products that keep pace with rapidly evolving customer expectation and new competitors withoutdisruption to business-critical systems. New technologies may also lead to more complex regulatory, strategic and reputation risks. In alignment w ith\\nour Digital First strategy, we continue to invest in emerging technologies and talent to adapt to the dynamic environment and deliver competitiveand digitally-enabled products and services to meet our customers’ expectations for personalized and on-demand banking, pursue new businessgrowth opportunities and improve operational efficiency. We remain committed to the prudent and responsible adoption of new technologies.\\nIn alignment with BMO’s Digital First strategy, we continue to invest in risk management technology that can also enhance the customer\\nexperience, streamline processes and reduce complexity.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s technology risk program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nThird-Party Risk\\nOur use of third-party relationships continues to evolve and expand, helping us to deliver new and innovative solutions across the bank and for ourclients. While third-party relationships can be beneficial for the bank, they can give rise to risks that may threaten BMO’s operational resilience, such\\nas compromising customer data or disrupting the availability of critical products and services, which may financially impact the bank. We continue t o\\nenhance and evolve our capabilities in order to maintain effective third-party risk management and oversight and the efficient delivery of productsand services that depend on third parties.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s third-party risk program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nGeopolitical Risk and Escalating Trade Disputes\\nGeopolitical uncertainty and conflicts between countries impact global economies and may lead to market volatility. The Russia-Ukraine conflict h as\\nhad an ongoing global impact, including higher energy prices and the erosion of business confidence. The financial, energy and technology sanctionsimposed on Russia by Ukraine’s allies could lead to long-term political, economic and military turmoil between Western countries and Russia.\\nThe Middle East conflict has heightened tensions significantly in the region, and the potential for escalation could drive up energy prices, unsettl e\\nfinancial markets and slow global growth even further, which would have a direct and indirect impact on our customers.\\nCanadian and U.S. relations with China remain strained, involving trade disputes and tensions over Taiwan. The political climate in the United\\nStates could lead to a new wave of tariffs, and a U.S. commitment to expanding trade ties with Taiwan may further elevate the tension. In addition,the strategic competition between the United States and China is driving greater global fragmentation, as both countries seek to reinforce theirautonomy, limit any vulnerabilities and insulate their technology sectors. This could adversely affect business investment and prove especiallyproblematic for commodity-producing countries such as Canada that rely on a large export market. Ongoing Canada-China disputes over politicalinterference are further evidence of this discord.\\nDiplomatic relations between Canada and India have also deteriorated, which could threaten to disrupt trade flows, tourism and immigration\\nbetween the two countries.\\nWe actively monitor global and North American events and trends, and continually assess our businesses in the context of these events and\\ntrends. Although our lending portfolio has limited direct exposure outside North America, our customers rely on global trade and sustained economicgrowth. To mitigate exposure to geopolitical risk, we maintain a diversified portfolio that we continually monitor, in addition to contingency plan s\\nthat are intended to prepare BMO for possible adverse developments. Our portfolios, business plans and capital adequacy are stress tested againstseverely adverse scenarios arising from trade-related shocks, and we build contingency plans and mitigation strategies aimed at addressing andoffsetting the consequences of possible adverse political and economic developments.\\nBMO’s credit exposure by geographic region is set out in Tables 67 to 73 in the Supplemental Information and in Note 4 of the audited annual\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 69\\n\\n\\n## Page 58\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk, including Climate Change\\nBMO is exposed to environmental and social risks, in particular climate risk related to environmental conditions and extreme weather events thatcould potentially disrupt our operations, impact our customers and counterparties, and result in lower earnings or potential losses. Factors contr ibuting\\nto heightened environmental risks include the impacts of climate change and the continued intensification of development in areas of greaterenvironmental sensitivity. Business continuity and disaster recovery plans provide us with the roadmap and tools to support the restoration,maintenance and management of critical operations and processes in the event of a business disruption.\\nWe are also exposed to risks related to borrowers that may experience financial losses or rising operating costs as a result of acute or chronic\\nchanges in climate conditions, climate-related litigation and/or policies, such as carbon emissions pricing, or a decline in revenue as new andemerging technologies and changing consumer preferences disrupt or displace demand for certain commodities, products and services. BMO’s climateambition is to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world. Our strategy seeks to capture commercialization opportunities byworking with our clients on their decarbonization journeys.\\nLegal and regulatory risk or reputation risk could arise from actual or perceived actions, or inaction, by our operations and those of our customers\\nin relation to climate change and other environmental and social risk issues, or our disclosures related to these matters. Risks related to these issu es\\ncould also affect our customers, suppliers or other interested parties, which could give rise to new risks. Globally, new and more stringent climate-related obligations are being developed, which may increase compliance requirements. Litigation or enforcement measures could arise from theseobligations to manage and report on climate-related risks.\\nRefer to the Environmental and Social Risk section for further discussion of these risks.\\nCanadian Housing Market and Consumer Leverage\\nElevated household debt continues to be a headwind for household spending and broader economic activity. The combination of still restrictiveinterest rate policy that results in higher mortgage payments at renewal and rising unemployment could further increase credit losses, particularl yi n\\nunsecured consumer credit. While recent and expected rate reductions by the Bank of Canada are alleviating pressure on Canadian households, thehousing market recovery will likely be constrained by the persistent lack of affordability, notably in Ontario and British Columbia, which could lim it\\nmortgage origination volumes. The risk of credit losses in our mortgage portfolio is in part mitigated by low loan-to-value and prudent underwritingpractices that stress test customers’ ability to service mortgage debt at higher interest rates. While portfolio stress test analysis suggests that even\\nsignificant price declines and challenging economic conditions would result in manageable losses, primarily due to insurance coverage and thelevel of equity held by owners with seasoned loans, delinquencies and insolvencies in our portfolio could adversely affect our results andfinancial condition. In addition, consumer loan losses could rise if unexpected economic weakness results in a significant further increase in theunemployment rate.\\nRegulatory Environment and Changes\\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated, and BMO has experienced increasing complexity in regulatory requirements and expectations, a s\\ngovernments and regulators around the world continue to pursue major reforms intended to strengthen the stability of the financial system andprotect key markets and participants. These reforms may lead to further increases in regulatory capital or liquidity requirements and additionalcompliance costs, which could lower returns and affect growth. Such reforms could also affect the cost and availability of funding and the level of thebank’s market-making activities. Regulatory reforms may also impact fees and other revenues for certain operating groups. In addition, difference si n\\nthe laws and regulations enacted by a range of national regulatory authorities may offer advantages to our international competitors, which couldaffect our ability to compete. We monitor such developments, and other potential changes, so that we are well-positioned to respond and implementany necessary changes. BMO is subject to legal proceedings, including investigations by regulators. Failure to comply with applicable legal andregulatory requirements and expectations could result in further legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions and fines, enforceme nt\\nactions, criminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in invest or and\\ncustomer confidence, and damage to our reputation.\\nRefer to the Legal and Regulatory Risk section for further discussion of these risks.\\nOther Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nFiscal and Monetary Policies and Other Economic Conditions in the Countries in which BMO Conducts BusinessFiscal and monetary policies and other economic conditions prevailing in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do businessmay impact profitability and heighten economic uncertainty in specific businesses and markets, which may in turn affect our customers andcounterparties, reduce profitability and contribute to a greater risk of credit losses. Levels of business debt remain elevated due to the residual e ffects\\nof the pandemic and the loss of governmental supports, which could impact our markets and our operating results. Interest rate fluctuations couldhave an impact on our earnings, the value of our investments, the credit quality of our loans to customers and counterparty exposure, as well as thecapital markets that we access.\\nFluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to other currencies have affected, and could continue to affect, the business operations\\nand results of clients with significant earnings or input costs denominated in foreign currencies. Our investments in operations outside of Canada a re\\nprimarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and the foreign exchange impact on our U.S.-dollar-denominated risk-weighted assets and capital deduction s\\nmay result in variability in our capital ratios. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section for further discussion of these risks. The v alue\\nof the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar will also affect the contribution of U.S. operations to Canadian-dollar profitability.\\nHedging positions may be taken to manage interest rate exposures and foreign exchange impacts, and to partially offset the effects of Canadian\\ndollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations on the bank’s financial results.\\nRefer to the 2024 Financial Performance Review – Foreign Exchange section and the Market Risk section for a more complete discussion of our\\nexposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.\\n70BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 59\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Tax Legislation and Interpretations\\nLegislative changes and changes in tax policy, including their interpretation by tax authorities and the courts, may impact earnings. Tax laws, as we ll\\nas interpretations of tax laws and policy by tax authorities, may change as a result of efforts by the Canadian and U.S. federal governments, other G20governments and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to increase taxes, broaden the tax base globally and improvetax-related reporting. For example, in fiscal 2024, the Canadian government enacted legislation to adopt the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BaseErosion and Profit Shifting two-pillar plan (Pillar 2) for international tax reform, which will levy a 15% minimum tax on operations globally.\\nFor further discussion, refer to the Future Changes in Accounting Policies – IAS-12, Income Taxes section.\\nChanges to Business Portfolio\\nAs part of its overall business strategy, BMO may acquire companies, businesses and assets. Although we conduct thorough due diligence beforecompleting these acquisitions, some acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our financial or strategic objectives or expectations. We may b e\\nsubject to regulatory and shareholder approvals to successfully complete an acquisition, and it may not be feasible to establish when, if or on whatterms the necessary approvals will be granted. Changes in the competitive and economic environment, as well as other factors, may result in adecline in revenue or profitability, while higher than anticipated integration costs and failure to realize anticipated cost savings after an acqui sition\\ncould also adversely affect earnings. Integration costs may increase because of regulatory costs related to an acquisition, operational loss event s,\\nother unanticipated expenses that were not identified in the due diligence process or demands on management time that are more significant thananticipated, as well as unexpected delays in implementing certain plans that may, in turn, lead to delays in achieving full integration. Successful p ost-\\nacquisition performance depends on retaining the clients and key employees of acquired companies and businesses and on integrating key systemsand processes without disruption.\\nBMO also evaluates potential dispositions of assets and businesses that may no longer meet strategic and financial objectives. When we seek to\\nsell assets or dispose of a business, we may have difficulty obtaining buyers or devising alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timel y\\nmanner, which could delay the achievement of strategic objectives. We may also dispose of assets or a business on terms that are less favourablethan anticipated or lead to adverse operational or financial impacts, or greater disruption than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on reven ue\\ngrowth may be greater than forecast. Dispositions may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions and the granting of governmental or regulatoryapprovals on acceptable terms that, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent the completion of a disposition as intended, or at all.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Judgments and Accounting Standards\\nBMO prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Changes that the International Accounting Standards Board makes fromtime to time may materially affect the way we record and report financial results. Future changes in accounting policies are discussed in the FutureChanges in Accounting Policies section, as well as in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe application of IFRS requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and\\nliabilities, certain amounts reported in net income and other related disclosures. In making these judgments and estimates, we rely on the bestinformation available at the time. However, it is possible that circumstances may change, new information may become available or models mayprove to be imprecise.\\nBMO’s financial results could be affected for the period during which any such new information or change in circumstances becomes apparent,\\nand the extent of the impact could be significant. More information is included in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section.\\nCautionThe Risks That May Affect Future Results section and the remainder of this Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section contain forward-looking stateme nts.

Our Enterprise Risk and Portfolio\\nManagement (ERPM) group oversees the implementation and operation of the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework (ERMF), and providesindependent review and oversight across the enterprise on risk-related issues, in order to enable prudent and measured risk-taking that is integrat ed\\nwith business strategy. All elements of the ERMF function together to support informed and effective risk management, while striking an appropriatebalance between risk and return.\\nThe ERMF guides our risk-taking activities in order to align them with customer needs, shareholder expectations and regulatory requirements. We\\nhave established a risk governance framework as part of the ERMF that serves as the foundation for consistent and effective management of risksfacing the bank, outlining our approach to understanding and managing risk, protecting BMO’s reputation, diversifying and limiting potential tail risk,\\nmaintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, and optimizing risk return. In addition, the ERMF defines roles and responsibilities across al l three\\nlines of defence. It incorporates our Risk Management Life Cycle and informs our efforts to identify, assess, manage (which includes mitigation),monitor and report on our exposure to material risks. The ERMF is driven by our people, processes and technology, along with a range of riskmanagement tools, including modelling and analytics, stress testing and scenario analysis, and our Risk Taxonomy. All elements of the ERMF aresupported by our risk culture and provide for direct management of each individual risk type, as well as the management of risk on an integratedbasis.\\nRisk Management Tools\\n(e.g.: Stress Testing, Scenario Analysis, Modelling, Analytics)Enterprise Risk Management Framework\\nRisk Culture\\n\\x81 Tone from the top\\n\\x81 Accountability\\x81 Effective communication and challenge\\n\\x81 IncentivesRisk Management EnablementIDENTIFY ASSESS MANAGE MONITOR REPORT Risk Management Life Cycle\\nRisk Taxonomy \\x81 Credit & Counterparty\\n\\x81 Market\\x81 Liquidity & Funding\\n\\x81 Insurance\\x81 Non-Financial**\\n\\x81 Reputation\\x81\\n\\x81Risk Governance\\nBoard\\n(RRC*, ACRC*)\\nSenior Management\\n(RMC*, ERC* & Management Committees*)\\nRisk Appetite Framework\\nPolicy Framework\\n1st Line\\nOperating Groups, Technology &\\nOperations, Corporate Services2nd Line\\nEnterprise Risk & Portfolio Management,\\nLegal & Regulatory Compliance3rd Line\\nCorporate Audit \\nDivisionRisk Management Approach Maintain strong capital and liquidity Diversify; limit tail risk Optimize risk return Understand and manage Protect our reputation\\nPeople - Process - Technology\\nRisk Governance\\nThe ERMF outlines a governance approach that includes robust Board of Directors and senior management oversight, a Risk Appetite Framework, the\\nEnterprise Policy Framework and the corresponding roles in the three-lines-of-defence operating model.\\nBoard of Directors and Senior Management Oversight\\nSpecific policies approved by our Board of Directors govern our approach to the management of material risks, and oversight is exercised at everylevel of the enterprise through a hierarchy of committees and individual responsibilities, as outlined in the following diagram. The Board of Direct ors\\nseeks to ensure that corporate objectives are supported by a sound risk strategy, prudent risk appetite and an effective ERMF that is appropriate tothe nature, scale, complexity and risk profile of our lines of business and other operations. The Board also has overall responsibility for oversight of\\nthe bank’s governance framework and corporate culture. Senior management reviews and discusses significant risk issues and action plans as theyarise in the implementation of the enterprise-wide strategy, exercising oversight and governance of the risks taken across the enterprise and theprocesses through which exposures to such risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported on, in accordance with policies, and heldwithin approved limits and risk tolerances.\\nThe ERMF is reviewed on a regular basis by the Risk Review Committee (RRC) of the Board of Directors, in order to exercise oversight and guide\\nrisk-taking activities.\\n72BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 61\\n\\n                          MD&A                          \\n(2) Co-chaired by the Chief Finan cial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.\\n(3) Chaired by the Chief Risk Officer.\\n(4) Chaired by the General Counsel.(5) Co-chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.(6) Co-chaired by the General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.Board/BoardCommittees\\nManagement\\nCommitteesBoard & Senior Management Oversight (1)\\nBoard of Directors\\nRisk Review Committee\\n(RRC)Audit and Conduct Review\\nCommittee (ACRC)\\nRisk Management\\nCommittee (RMC) (3)Reputation Risk Management\\nCommittee (RRMC) (4)Asset Liability\\nCommittee (ALCO) (5)Enterprise Regulatory \\nCommittee (ERC) (6)Enterprise Capital\\nManagement\\nCommittee (ECMC) (2)\\n(1) Reporting relationships shown in dotted lines, sub-committees shown as solid lines.\\nIn addition to the oversight exercised by the Board of Directors and senior management, effective governance of the bank’s risks is overseen by\\nmanagement committees and supported by the three-lines-of-defence operating model, which addresses risks across the operating groups andCorporate Services.\\nBoard of Directors is responsible for supervising the management\\nof the business and affairs of BMO. The Board, either directly orthrough its committees, is responsible for oversight of the followingareas: strategic planning; defining risk appetite; identifying andmanaging risk; managing capital; fostering a culture of integrity;internal controls; succession planning and evaluation of seniormanagement; communication; public disclosure; and corporategovernance.\\nRisk Review Committee (RRC) of the Board of Directors assists the\\nBoard in fulfilling its risk management oversight responsibilities.This includes overseeing a strong risk culture; overseeing theidentification, assessment and management of BMO’s risks;monitoring adherence to risk management corporate policies andcompliance with risk-related regulatory requirements; and evaluatingthe effectiveness of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), in conjunction withthe Human Resources Committee, including input into successionplanning for the CRO. The ERMF is reviewed at least annually by theRRC, and guides risk-taking activities and sets out the bank’sapproach to risk management.\\nAudit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Board of\\nDirectors assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilitiesfor the integrity of BMO’s financial reporting and sustainabilityreporting, including the effectiveness of BMO’s internal controls; theinternal audit function; the qualifications, independence andperformance of the independent auditors; BMO’s compliance withlaws and regulations; transactions involving related parties; conflictsof interest and confidential information; standards of businessconduct and ethics; cyber security; and consumer protectionmeasures and complaints.\\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) is directly accountable to the Board for\\nall of BMO’s risk-taking activities. The CEO is supported by the CROand the ERPM group.Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports directly to the CEO, is head of ERPM,\\nchair of RMC and reports to the RRC on risk-related matters. The CROis responsible for providing independent review and oversight ofenterprise-wide risks and leadership on risk issues, developing andmaintaining the ERMF and fostering a strong risk culture across theenterprise.\\nManagement Level Committees overseeing risk matters, including\\nthe Enterprise Capital Management Committee (ECMC), RiskManagement Committee (RMC), Reputation Risk ManagementCommittee (RRMC), Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and EnterpriseRegulatory Committee (ERC), bring together senior executivemembers of BMO management to oversee risk management acrossthe enterprise. The committees are chaired by members of theExecutive Committee, exercising risk oversight and governance fortheir respective risks at the highest levels of management.\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM) , as the second\\nline of defence, provides risk management oversight, effectivechallenge and independent assessment of risk and risk-takingactivities. ERPM supports a disciplined approach to risk-taking byexercising its responsibility for independent transactional approvaland portfolio management, policy formulation, risk reporting, stresstesting, modelling and risk education. This approach promotesconsistency in risk management practices and standards across theenterprise, and verifies that any risks accepted are consistent withBMO’s risk appetite.\\nOperating Groups and Corporate Services , including Technology\\nand Operations, are responsible for effectively managing risks byidentifying, assessing, managing, monitoring, mitigating andreporting on exposures to risk within their respective operations andlines of business, in accordance with their established risk appetite.They exercise business judgment and maintain effective policies,processes and internal controls, so that significant risk issues areescalated and reviewed by ERPM. Individual governance committeesand ERPM establish and monitor risk limits that are consistent with,and subordinate to, the Board-approved limits.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 73\\n\\n\\n## Page 62\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nRisk Appetite Framework\\nWe believe that risk management is every employee’s responsibility. This is guided by five key principles that define our approach to managing risk\\nacross the enterprise and comprise our Risk Appetite:\\n‰Understand and Manage by only taking risks that are transparent and understood.\\n‰Protect BMO’s Reputation by adhering to principles of honesty, integrity, respect and high ethical standards, in line with our Code of Conduct.\\n‰Diversify. Limit Tail Risk by targeting a business mix that minimizes earnings volatility and exposure to low-probability, high-impact events.\\n‰Maintain Strong Capital and Liquidity positions that meet, or exceed, regulatory requirements and market expectations.\\n‰Optimize Risk Return by managing risk-adjusted exposures and making decisions that create value for shareholders.\\nOur Risk Appetite Framework consists of a Risk Appetite Statement, risk limits and an outline of the responsibilities of the Board of Directors, its\\ncommittees and senior management. The Risk Appetite Statement incorporates a risk appetite, comprising both qualitative statements andquantitative measures (including risk limits), that indicates the aggregate level and types of risk that the bank is willing to assume in order to supp ort\\nsound business initiatives and drive appropriate returns and targeted growth. The risk appetite is integrated within our strategic and businessobjectives and our capital and liquidity plans, as well as the bank’s recovery and resolution plans. Our risk appetite is established by following theRisk Appetite Framework principles, supported by corporate policies, standards and guidelines, as well as committee mandates, and is developed tomeet regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. The Risk Appetite Framework assists senior management and the Board ofDirectors in assessing the bank’s risk profile against our risk appetite. Both the Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Appetite Statement are reviewedand approved by the Board of Directors annually. Our risk appetite is articulated and applied consistently across the enterprise, with operating gro ups,\\nkey businesses and entities developing their own respective risk appetite statements within this framework.\\nRisk Limits\\nRisk limits are set so that risk-taking activities remain within BMO’s risk appetite, balancing risk diversification, exposure to loss and risk-adj usted\\nreturns. These limits inform business strategies and decisions, and are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors or management or itscommittees, as appropriate, based on the level and granularity of the limits. They include:\\n‰Credit and Counterparty Risk – limits on group and single-name exposures and material country, industry and portfolio/product segments.\\n‰Market Risk – limits on economic value and earnings exposures to stress scenarios and significant market movements, as well as limits on value at\\nrisk and stress related to trading and underwriting activities.\\n‰Insurance Risk – limits on policy exposures and reinsurance arrangements.\\n‰Liquidity and Funding Risk – minimum limits governing the internal liquidity stress testing scenario, minimum regulatory liquidity ratio\\nrequirements, and maximum levels of asset pledging and wholesale funding, as well as limits related to liability diversification and exposure tocredit and liquidity facilities.\\n‰Operational Non-Financial Risk – key metrics for measuring operational and other non-financial risks that may have financial consequences.\\nThe Board of Directors, after considering recommendations from the RRC and RMC, annually reviews and approves key risk limits and then delegates\\noverall authority for these limits to the CEO. The CEO in turn delegates more specific authorities to the senior executives of the operating groups (fi rst\\nline of defence), who are responsible for the management of risk in their respective operations, and to the CRO. These delegated authorities allowrisk officers to set risk tolerances, approve geographic and industry sector exposure limits within defined parameters, and establish underwritin g and\\ninventory limits for trading and investment banking activities. The criteria under which more specific authorities may be delegated across theorganization, as well as the requirements relating to documentation, communication and monitoring of those specific delegated authorities, are se t\\nout in corporate policies and standards.\\nEnterprise Policy Framework\\nThe Enterprise Policy Framework includes a comprehensive set of risk-related corporate policies, each of which is approved by the RRC, ACRC or theBoard of Directors, as well as corporate standards issued pursuant to those corporate policies that have been reviewed by the RMC and approved bysenior management. Corporate policies and standards collectively outline the principles, expectations, and roles and responsibilities of seniormanagement for ensuring that exposures to key risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported. Corporate policies and standardsare reviewed and updated at a minimum every two years.\\nThe Enterprise Policy Framework also includes supporting directives and procedures that apply across the first and second lines of defence to\\noperationalize the requirements, roles and responsibilities, and frameworks outlined in those corporate policies and standards.\\n74BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 63', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 7, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667321', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 63\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Three-Lines-of-Defence Operating Model\\nOur ERMF is operationalized through the three-lines-of-defence approach to managing risk, as described below:\\n‰Operating groups and Corporate Services, which includes Technology and Operations, serve as our first line of defence. They are accountable for the\\nrisks arising from their businesses, operations and exposures. They are expected to pursue business opportunities within their established riskappetite and to identify, assess, manage (which includes mitigation), monitor and report on risks in, or arising from, their businesses, operationsand exposures. The first line fulfills its responsibilities by applying risk management and reporting methodologies, by establishing appropriateinternal controls in accordance with the ERMF, and by monitoring the effectiveness of such controls. These processes and controls serve as theframework for our lines of business to act within their delegated risk-taking authority and risk limits, as set out in corporate policies and the RiskAppetite Framework. Corporate Services, while part of our first line of defence, may also serve in a governance capacity when specific roles andresponsibilities are assigned to individuals or groups under the Enterprise Policy Framework. In such instances, governance accountabilities wil lb e\\ncarried out independent of the individuals or groups responsible for risk-taking.\\n‰The second line of defence comprises ERPM and Legal & Regulatory Compliance. The second line exercises independent oversight, performseffective challenge and provides independent assessment of risks and risk management practices, including transactions, product and portfolio ri sk\\nmanagement decisions, regulatory compliance, and processes and controls applied in the first line of defence. The second line establishesenterprise-wide risk management policies, frameworks, processes, methodologies and practices that the first and second lines use to identify,assess, manage (which includes mitigation), monitor and report on risks across the enterprise.\\n‰Corporate Audit Division is the third line of defence. It provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls across theenterprise, including controls that support the risk management and governance processes, and reports its findings to the Board of Directors.\\nRisk Taxonomy\\nOur Risk Taxonomy categorizes the key risks to which BMO is exposed and p rovides a framework for the risk management life cycle in relation to\\neach of the key risks. Our Risk Taxonomy incorporates exposures to financ ial risks (Credit and Counterparty Risk, Market Risk, Insurance Risk and\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk), non-financial risks (Operational Non-Finan cial Risk and Legal and Regulatory Risk) and transverse risks, which inter sect\\nwith both financial and non-financial risks (Strategic Risk, Environment al and Social Risk and Reputation Risk ). We maintain sub-categories under\\neach Tier 1 risk to support effective risk management practices as part of the overall ERMF. Failure in managing these risks, or in controlling our\\nexposures to them, could have material financial consequences for BMO.\\nRisk Management Life Cycle\\nRisk Identification, Assessment and ManagementRisk identification is an integral step in recognizing the key inherent risks that BMO faces, assessing the potential for loss and then acting to\\nmitigate this potential. Our Risk Taxonomy documents the key risks, suppo rting the implementation of our Risk Appetite Framework and assisting in\\nidentifying the primary risk categories for which stress capital consumpti on is estimated. Risk review and approval processes are established base d\\non the nature, size and complexity of the risks involved. Generally, t hese involve a formal review and approval by either an individual or a\\ncommittee that is independent of the originator. Delegated a uthorities and approvals by category are outlined below.\\n‰Portfolio transactions – transactions are approved through risk assessment processes for all types of transactions at all levels of the enterprise,\\nwhich include operating group recommendations and ERPM approval of credit risk, and transactional and position limits for market risk.\\n‰Structured transactions – new structured products and transactions with significant legal and regulatory, accounting or tax implications are\\nreviewed by the Global Markets Risk Committee, as appropriate, and are also assessed under the operational risk management process if theyinvolve structural or operational complexity that may give rise to significant operational risk. Transactions that may give rise to significant orheightened reputation risk are reviewed by the Reputation Risk Management Committee.\\n‰Investment initiatives – documentation of risk assessments is formalized through the investment assessment and approval process, and is\\nreviewed and approved by Corporate Services based on the size of an initiative’s investment spending and its inherent risk.\\n‰New products and services – policies and procedures for the approval of new or modified products and services offered to customers are the\\nresponsibility of both the first and second lines of defence, including appropriate senior business leaders, and are reviewed and approved bysubject matter experts and senior management in Corporate Services, as well as by other senior management committees.\\nRisk Monitoring and Reporting\\nRisk-Based Capital AssessmentTwo measures of risk-based capital are used by BMO: economic capital and regulatory capital. Both are aggregate measures of the risk that the bankassumes in pursuit of its financial objectives, and enable the evaluation of returns on a risk-adjusted basis. Our operating model provides for thedirect management of each type of risk, as well as the management of material risks on an integrated basis. Measuring the economic profitability oftransactions or portfolios involves a combination of both expected and unexpected losses to assess the extent and correlation of risk beforeauthorizing new exposures. Both expected and unexpected loss measures for a current transaction or portfolio reflect current and future marketconditions, the inherent risk in the position and, as appropriate, its credit quality. Risk-based capital methods and material models are reviewed a t\\nleast annually and updated as appropriate. The risk-based capital models provide a forward-looking estimate of the difference between themaximum potential loss in economic (or market) value and expected loss, measured over a specified time interval and using a defined confidencelevel.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 75\\n\\n\\n## Page 64\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nStress Testing\\nStress testing is a key element of our risk management and capital management frameworks. It is integrated into our enterprise and group riskappetite statements and embedded in our management processes. To evaluate risks, we regularly test a range of scenarios, which vary in frequency,severity and complexity, in portfolios and businesses across the enterprise. In addition, we participate in regulatory stress tests in multiplejurisdictions.\\nQuantitative models and tools, along with qualitative evaluations, are utilized to assess the impact of changes in the macroeconomic\\nenvironment on the income statement and balance sheet and the resilience of the bank’s capital position over a forecast horizon. Models utilized forstress testing are approved and governed under the Model Risk Management Framework, and are used to establish a better understanding of ourrisks and to test our capital adequacy.\\nBMO’s stress testing framework integrates stress testing at the line of business, portfolio, industry, geographic and product level, and embeds\\nthe test results in strategy, business planning and decision-making. Targeted portfolio, industry and geographic analysis is conducted by ERPM andthe lines of business to test risk appetite, limits, concentration and strategy. Ad hoc stress testing is conducted in response to changing economic o r\\nmarket conditions and in order to assess business strategies.\\nEnterprise stress testing is conducted to support BMO’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and target-setting through analysis\\nof the potential effects of low-frequency, high-severity events on our earnings, our balance sheet, and our liquidity and capital positions. Scenar io\\nselection is a multi-step process that considers material and idiosyncratic risks and the potential impact of new or emerging trends on risk profiles ,a s\\nwell as on the macroeconomic environment. Scenarios may be defined by senior management or regulators. The economic impacts are determinedby the Economics group, which distills the scenarios into macroeconomic and market variables that include, but are not limited to, GDP growth, yieldcurve estimates, unemployment rates, real estate prices, stock index growth and changes in corporate profits. These macroeconomic variables drivestress loss models, tools and qualitative assessments that are applied to determine estimated stress impacts. The scenarios are used by operating,risk and finance groups to assess a broad range of financial impacts that BMO could experience as a result of a specific stress, as well as in theordinary course of business, and extraordinary actions anticipated in response to that stress.\\nGovernance of the stress testing framework resides with senior management, including the Enterprise Stress Testing Committee. This committee\\ncomprises business, risk and finance executives, and is accountable for reviewing and challenging enterprise-wide scenarios and stress test resul ts.\\nStress testing and enterprise-wide scenarios associated with the ICAAP, including recommendations for actions that the enterprise could take in or der\\nto manage the impact of a stress event, are established by senior management and presented to the Board of Directors. Oversight and governance ofthe stress testing associated with the Horizontal Capital Review (HCR), which is a U.S. regulatory requirement for BMO Financial Corp. (BFC), areexercised at the BFC level by its Board of Directors through its Risk Oversight and Capital Committee.\\nRefer to the Environmental and Social Risk section for a discussion of our climate scenario analysis program.\\nRisk Culture\\nRisk culture at BMO is the set of shared norms, attitudes and behaviours rela ted to risk awareness, risk-taking and risk management. Sound risk cultur e\\nis designed to support appropriate behaviours and judgments about risk-ta king, and promotes effective risk management and the alignment of risk-\\ntaking activities with BMO’s Risk Appetite. Our risk culture informs and su pports our overall organizational culture. We are committed to high ethic al\\nstandards, grounded in our values of integrity, empathy, diversity and r esponsibility. ERPM is responsible for the development and promotion of a\\nhealthy, strong risk culture across the enterprise. In pursuing this manda te, ERPM works closely with Legal & Regulatory Compliance and its Ethics Of fice,\\nas well as People & Culture. BMO’s risk culture is founded on four guiding prin ciples that together reinforce its effectiveness across the bank: Tone f rom\\nthe Top, Accountability, Effective Communication and Challenge, and Incentives.\\n‰Tone from the Top: Our risk culture is grounded in an approach to risk management that encourages openness, constructive challenge and\\npersonal accountability. Each member of senior management plays a critical role in fostering this strong risk culture among employees byeffectively communicating this responsibility and by the example of their actions. The Board of Directors oversees BMO’s corporate objectives andthe requirement that they be supported by a sound risk strategy and an effective ERMF that is appropriate to the nature, scale, complexity and riskprofile of our operations.\\n‰Accountability: BMO’s ERMF is anchored in the three-lines-of-defence approach to managing risk. Our risk culture also encourages the escalation of\\nconcerns associated with potential or emerging risks to senior management, so that those concerns can be appropriately evaluated and addressed.BMO encourages and supports an environment in which concerns can be raised without retaliation.\\n‰Effective Communication and Challenge: Timely and transparent sharing of information is integral to engaging business partners in key decisions\\nand strategy discussions, which brings added rigour and discipline to BMO’s decision-making. This not only leads to the timely identification,escalation and resolution of issues, but also encourages open communication, independent challenge and an understanding of the key risks facedby the organization, so that employees are equipped and empowered to make decisions and take action in a coordinated and consistent manner,supported by a strong and effective monitoring and control framework.\\n‰Incentives: Compensation and other incentives are aligned with prudent risk-taking. These are designed to reward the appropriate use of capital\\nand respect for the rules and principles of the ERMF, and to discourage excessive risk-taking. Risk managers have input into the design of incentiveprograms that may have an effect on risk-taking. We also maintain training programs that are designed to foster a deep understanding of BMO’scapital management and risk management frameworks across the enterprise, providing employees and management with the tools and insightsthey need to fulfill their responsibilities for independent oversight, regardless of their role in the organization.\\n76BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 65\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Credit and Counterparty Risk\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk is the potential for financial loss due to the failure of an obligor (i.e., a borrower, endorser, guarantor or counterparty)\\nto repay a loan or honour another predetermined financial obligation.\\nCredit and counterparty risk underlies every lending activity that we enter into, and also arises in the holding of investment securities, transacti ons\\nrelated to trading and other capital markets products, and activities related to securitization. Credit and counterparty risk represents the mostsignificant measurable risk we face. Effective management of credit and counterparty risk is integral to our success, since failure to do so could hav e\\nan immediate and significant impact on our earnings, financial condition and reputation.\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk Governance\\nThe Credit Risk Management Framework seeks to ensure that material credit risks to which the enterprise is exposed are identified, assessed,managed, monitored and reported on regularly. The Risk Review Committee (RRC) has oversight of the management of material risks that BMO faces,including the Credit Risk Management Framework. The framework incorporates governing principles that are defined in a series of corporate policiesand standards and are given effect through specific operating procedures. These policies and standards are reviewed on a regular basis and modifiedas necessary, so that they are current and consistent with our risk appetite. The structure, limits (both notional and capital-based), collateralrequirements, monitoring, reporting and ongoing management of credit and counterparty exposures are governed by these credit risk managementprinciples.\\nLending officers in the operating groups are responsible for recommending credit decisions based on the completion of appropriate due\\ndiligence, and they assume accountability for the related risks. In some instances, relatively small transactions may be assessed by an automateddecision-making process, or they may be approved by first-line underwriters with appropriate training, independence and oversight. Credit office rs in\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM) approve larger transactions or transactions involving greater risk and are accountable for provid ing\\nan objective independent assessment of the relevant lending recommendations and risks assumed by the lending officers. All of these individuals inthe first and second lines of defence are subject to a lending qualification process and operate in a disciplined environment with clear delegation ofdecision-making authority, including individually delegated lending limits where appropriate, which are reviewed annually or more frequently, a s\\nneeded. The Board of Directors annually delegates to the CEO discretionary lending limits for further specific delegation to senior officers. Credi t\\ndecision-making is conducted at the management level based on the size and risk of each transaction, in accordance with a range of corporatepolicies, standards and procedures governing the conduct of activities in which credit risk arises. Corporate Audit Division reviews and testsmanagement processes and controls and samples credit transactions in order to assess adherence to acceptable lending standards as set out inBMO’s Risk Appetite Statement, as well as compliance with applicable corporate policies, standards and procedures.\\nFor wholesale borrowers presenting a higher than normal risk of default, we have formal policies in place that outline the framework for\\nmanaging such accounts, as well as specialized groups that manage them, as appropriate. We strive to identify borrowers facing financial difficultyearly, and to return such accounts to an acceptable level of risk through the application of good business judgment and the implementation of soundand constructive workout solutions.\\nAll credit risk exposures are subject to regular monitoring. Performing wholesale accounts are reviewed on a regular basis, generally no less\\nfrequently than annually, with most subject to internal monitoring of triggers that, if breached, result in an interim review. The frequency of revie w\\nrises in accordance with the likelihood and size of potential credit losses, and deteriorating higher-risk situations are referred to specialized a ccount\\nmanagement groups for closer attention, as appropriate. In addition, regular portfolio and sector reviews are conducted, including stress testing and\\nscenario analysis based on current, emerging or prospective risks. Reporting is provided at least quarterly, and more frequently where appropriate ,t o\\nthe Board of Directors and senior management committees in order to keep them informed of credit risk developments in our portfolios, includingchanges in credit risk concentrations, watchlist accounts, impaired loans, provisions for credit losses, negative credit migration and significa nt\\nemerging credit risk issues. This supports the RRC and senior management committees in any related decisions they may make.\\nCounterparty credit risk (CCR) involves a bilateral risk of loss because the market value of a transaction can be positive or negative for either\\ncounterparty. CCR exposures are subject to the credit oversight, limits, risk management framework and approval process outlined above. However,given the nature of the risk, CCR exposures are also monitored under the market risk framework. In order to reduce our exposure to CCR, transactionsare often collateralized and trades may be cleared through a regulated central counterparty (CCP), which reduces overall systemic risk by standingbetween counterparties, maximizing netting across trades and insulating counterparties from each other’s defaults. CCPs mitigate the risk of defa ult\\nby any member through margin requirements (both initial and variation) and a default management process, including a default fund and otherprovisions. Our exposures to CCPs are subject to the same credit risk governance, monitoring and rating framework we apply to all other corporateaccounts.\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk Management\\nCollateral ManagementCollateral is used for credit risk mitigation purposes in order to minimize losses that would otherwise be incurred in the event of a default. Dependin g\\non the type of borrower or counterparty, the assets available and the structure and term of the credit obligations, collateral can take various forms.For wholesale borrowers, collateral can take the form of pledges of the assets of a business, such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or rea l\\nestate, or personal assets pledged in support of guarantees. For trading counterparties, BMO may enter into legally enforceable netting agreementsfor on-balance sheet credit exposures, when possible. In the securities financing business (including repurchase agreements and securities lendi ng\\nagreements), we obtain eligible financial collateral that we control and can readily liquidate.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 77\\n\\n\\n## Page 66\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nCollateral for BMO’s derivatives trading counterparty exposures primarily comprises cash and eligible liquid securities that are monitored and\\nrevalued on a daily basis. Collateral is obtained under the contractual terms of standardized industry documentation.\\nWith limited exceptions, we utilize the Master Agreement provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc., frequently with a\\nCredit Support Annex, to document our collateralized trading relationships with counterparties for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are n ot\\ncentrally cleared.\\nA Credit Support Annex entitles a party to demand a transfer of collateral (or other credit support) when its exposure to OTC derivatives of the\\nother party exceeds an agreed threshold. Collateral to be transferred can include variation margin or initial and variation margin. Credit SupportAnnexes contain, among other measures, certain thresholds and provisions setting out acceptable types of collateral, a method for their valuation(discounts are often applied to market values), the availability of the collateral for re-pledging by the recipient and the manner in which interest i st o\\nbe calculated.\\nTo document our contractual securities financing relationships with counterparties, we utilize master repurchase agreements for repurchase\\ntransactions, and master securities lending agreements for securities lending transactions.\\nOn a periodic basis, collateral is subject to revaluation based on the specific asset type. For loans, the value of collateral is initially establishe da t\\nthe time of origination, and the frequency of revaluation is dependent on the type of collateral. For certain types of collateral that change frequent ly\\n(e.g., accounts receivable and inventory), monitoring consists of borrower reporting, covenants and/or triggers, as appropriate, to provide earl y\\nwarning signs of collateral value deterioration. Periodic inspections of physical collateral may be performed, where appropriate, taking intoconsideration collateral type, borrower risk profile and the feasibility of conducting such inspections. For commercial real estate collateral, a full\\nexternal appraisal of the property is typically obtained at the time of loan origination, unless the exposure is below a specified threshold amount, i n\\nwhich case an internal evaluation and a site inspection are conducted. Internal evaluations may consider property tax assessments, purchase prices ,\\nreal estate listings or realtor opinions. The case for an updated appraisal is reviewed annually, with consideration given to the borrower risk ratin g,\\nexisting tenants and lease contracts, as well as current market conditions.\\nIn the event a loan is classified as impaired, and depending on its size, a current external appraisal, valuation or restricted use appraisal is\\nobtained and updated every 12 months, or more frequently as appropriate, as long as the loan remains classified as impaired. In Canada, forresidential real estate that has an original loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than 80%, an independent property valuation is routinely obtained at t he\\ntime of loan origination. For U.S. residential loans secured by real estate, an independent property valuation is obtained for loans that will be reta ined\\nin BMO’s loan portfolio. For certain real estate loans originated for sale to government-sponsored agencies, the requirement may be waived based onan existing valuation already on file with that agency.\\nWe may use an external service provided by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) or an automated valuation model from a third-\\nparty appraisal management provider to assist in determining either the current value of a property or the need for a full property appraisal.\\nFor insured residential mortgages in Canada with an original LTV ratio greater than 80%, the default insurer is responsible for confirming the\\ncurrent value of the property.\\nPortfolio Management and Concentrations of Credit and Counterparty Risk\\nOur credit risk governance policies require an acceptable level of diversification, intended to ensure we avoid undue concentrations of credit risk .\\nConcentrations of credit risk may exist when a relatively large number of clients are engaged in similar activities, are located in the same geographi c\\nregion or have similar economic characteristics such that their ability to meet contractual obligations could be similarly affected by changes ineconomic, political or other conditions. Limits may be specified for several portfolio dimensions, including industry, specialty segments, count ry,\\nproduct and single-name concentrations. We use a range of tools to reduce the credit risk exposures in our loan portfolio. These include asset sales,traditional securitizations, or the purchase of credit protection in the form of credit default swaps or credit insurance and risk transfer transact ions.\\nCredit risk is mitigated by obtaining protection from better-rated counterparties or high-quality collateral. Credit risk mitigation activities support our\\nmanagement of capital, and individual and portfolio credit concentration.\\nOur credit assets consist of a well-diversified portfolio representing millions of clients, the majority of them individual consumers and small to\\nmedium-sized businesses. On a drawn loans and commitments basis, our most significant credit exposure at default as at October 31, 2024 was toindividual consumers, comprising $353,309 million ($344,912 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nCredit valuation adjustments (CVA) are fair value adjustments to capture counterparty credit risk in our derivative valuations. CVA profit and loss\\n(P&L) is recognized daily and provides a mitigant to the loss from a counterparty default by recognizing the expected credit loss given thecounterparty’s probability of default, as well as our credit exposure. The risks that arise from CVA are subject to our risk governance framework andare actively monitored by a business unit reporting to trading management that has been designated to manage CVA P&L for the bank. Markethedging is performed to manage CVA risks. This activity is subject to the bank’s risk control framework in order to manage the effectiveness ofhedges, and to provide independent review and oversight. The bank calculates CVA capital using both the standardized and basic approachmethodologies for CVA.\\nWrong-Way Risk\\nWrong-way risk occurs when our exposure to a counterparty increases at the same time that the credit quality of that counterparty deteriorates.Specific wrong-way risk arises when the credit quality of the counterparty and the market risk factors affecting collateral or other risk mitigantsdisplay a high correlation, and general wrong-way risk arises when the credit quality of the counterparty, for non-specific reasons, is highly corre lated\\nwith macroeconomic or other factors that affect the value of the risk mitigant. Our procedures require that specific wrong-way risk be identified intransactions and accounted for in the assessment of risk, including any heightened level of exposure.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\n78BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 67\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Credit and Counterparty Risk Measurement\\nBMO quantifies credit risk at both the individual borrower or counterparty level and the portfolio level. In order to limit earnings volatility, mana ge\\nexpected credit losses and minimize unexpected losses, credit risk is assessed and measured using the following risk-based parameters:\\n‰Exposure at Default (EAD) represents an estimate of the outstanding amount of a credit exposure at the time a default may occur.\\n‰Loss Given Default (LGD) is a measure of BMO’s economic loss, such as the amount that may not be recovered in the event of a default, presented\\nas a proportion of the exposure at default.\\n‰Probability of Default (PD) represents the likelihood that a borrower or counterparty will go into default over a one-year time horizon.\\n‰Expected Loss (EL) is a measure of the loss that BMO is expected to incur in the normal course of business in a given period of time. EL is\\ncalculated as a function of EAD, LGD and PD.\\nUnder Basel III, OSFI permits three approaches to the measurement of credit risk: Standardized, Foundation Internal Ratings Based (FIRB) and\\nAdvanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB). BMO primarily uses the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach, which includes both FIRB and AIRB, todetermine credit risk-weighted assets (RWA) in its portfolios, including portfolios of the bank’s subsidiary BMO Financial Corp. Under the Basel II I\\nReform requirement, it is mandatory to apply FIRB to a subset of IRB exposures where LGD and EAD are based on regulatory prescribed values. Referto the Supplementary Regulatory Capital Information disclosure for details regarding the total exposure (measured as EAD) of Retail and Wholesaleportfolios under the IRB Approach to determining regulatory capital. The remaining exposures reflect waivers and exemptions to the IRB Approachand are measured under the Standardized Approach, subject to OSFI’s approval. We continue to transition all material exposures in this category tothe IRB Approach. For securitization exposures, we apply the Basel hierarchy of approaches, including the Securitization Internal Ratings BasedApproach and the External Ratings Based Approach, as well as the Standardized Approach.\\nBMO’s regulatory capital and economic capital frameworks both use EAD to assess credit and counterparty risk. Capital is calculated based on\\nexposures that, where applicable, have been redistributed to a more favourable PD band or LGD measure, or a different Basel asset class, as a resultof the application of credit risk mitigation and a consideration of credit risk mitigants, including collateral and netting.\\nTotal credit exposures at default by type and industry sector, as at October 31, 2024 and 2023, based on the Basel III classifications, are disclosed in\\nthe table below.\\nTABLE 34\\n(Canadian $ in millions) Drawn (3) (7)Commitments\\n(undrawn) (3) (8)Other off-balance\\nsheet items (3) (9) OTC derivatives (4) (10)Repo-style\\ntransactions (4) (5) (11) Total (1)\\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\\nIndividual 287,741 281,087 65,568 63,812 – 13 – – – – 353,309 344,912\\nFinancial institutions 105,378 95,366 20,484 18,690 7,447 7,201 27,393 19,307 17,712 16,177 178,414 156,741\\nGovernments 230,353 219,795 3,024 2,551 1,760 1,575 4,481 8,193 1,070 5,870 240,688 237,984\\nManufacturing 33,561 33,046 15,555 16,059 1,696 1,915 1,049 807 – – 51,861 51,827\\nReal estate 66,650 61,734 8,632 11,843 1,234 971 412 224 – – 76,928 74,772\\nRetail trade 30,595 27,825 4,262 4,621 645 441 152 129 – – 35,654 33,016\\nService industries 54,433 56,588 13,830 13,552 3,192 3,172 990 696 – – 72,445 74,008\\nWholesale trade 21,868 19,997 7,212 7,618 670 611 268 167 – – 30,018 28,393\\nOil and gas 3,180 3,335 3,010 2,889 623 788 610 1,444 – – 7,423 8,456\\nUtilities 10,068 11,101 9,304 8,767 3,799 4,547 2,444 1,850 – – 25,615 26,265\\nOthers (2) 54,173 63,210 19,247 18,132 4,343 4,009 2,306 1,634 – – 80,069 86,985\\nTotal exposure at\\ndefault (6) 898,000 873,084 170,128 168,534 25,409 25,243 40,105 34,451 18,782 22,047 1,152,424 1,123,359\\n(1) Credit exposure excluding equity, securitization and other assets, such as non-significant investments, goodwill, deferred tax assets and int angibles.\\n(2) Includes remaining industries that individually comprise less than 2% of total exposures.(3) Represents gross credit exposures without accounting for collateral.(4) Credit exposure at default is inclusive of collateral.(5) Repo-style transactions include repos, reverse repos and securities lending transactions, which represent both asset and liability exposures .

Adjudication models, behavioural scorecards, decision tree s and expert knowledge are combined to generate optimal credit decisions in a\\ncentralized and automated environment.\\nThe retail risk rating system assesses risk based on individual loan characteristics. We have a range of internally developed PD, LGD and EAD\\nmodels for each of the major retail portfolios. The principle product lines within each of the retail portfolios are modelled separately, so that the r isk-\\nbased parameters capture the distinct nature of each product. The models, in general, are based on internal historical data recorded over a multi-yea r\\nperiod that includes at least one full economic cycle, in compliance with regulatory requirements. Adjustments are incorporated into the parameter s,\\nas appropriate, to account for uncertainties. The retail parameters are tested and calibrated on an annual basis, if required, to incorporate additi onal\\ndata points and recent experience in the parameter estimation process. Risk drivers used in the retail credit models may include customer attributes\\nsuch as delinquency status and credit scores, and account attributes such as loan amounts and utilization.\\n‰APD estimate is assigned to each homogeneous pool to reflect the long-run average of one-year default rates over the economic cycle.\\n‰AnLGD estimate is calculated by discounting future recovery payments to the time of default, including collection costs.\\n‰AnEAD estimate is calculated as the balance at default divided by the credit limit at the beginning of the year. For non-revolving products, such as\\nmortgages, EAD is equal to 100% of the current outstanding balance and has no undrawn component.\\nFor capital purposes, the LGD and EAD estimates are calibrated to reflect downturn conditions. The PD, LGD and EAD estimates are updated annuallyand recalibrated as required by comparing the estimates to observed historical experience.\\nRetail Credit Probability of Default Bands by Risk RatingTABLE 35\\nRisk profile Probability of default band\\nExceptionally low ≤0.05%\\nVery low > 0.05% to 0.20%Low > 0.20% to 0.75%Medium > 0.75% to 7.00%High > 7.00% to 99.99%Default 100%\\nWholesale (Sovereign, Bank, Corporate and Commercial)\\nWithin our wholesale portfolios, an enterprise-wide risk rating framework is applied to all sovereign, bank, corporate and commercial counterpart ies.\\nOne key element of this framework is the assignment of appropriate borrower or counterparty risk ratings (BRRs). We have a range of internallydeveloped general and sector-specific BRR models, as well as portfolio-level LGD and EAD models.\\nThe BRR models capture the key financial and non-financial characteristics of the borrowers and generate a borrower-level rating that reflects the\\nrelative ranking of the default risk. The models are primarily based on internal data, supplemented by judgment as necessary, for low-defaultportfolios.\\nBRRs are assessed and assigned at the time of loan origination, and reassessed when borrowers request changes to credit facilities or when\\nevents trigger a review, such as an external rating change or a covenant breach. BRRs are typically reviewed no less frequently than annually, andmore frequent reviews are conducted for borrowers with less acceptable risk ratings. The assigned ratings are mapped to a PD reflecting the\\nlikelihood of default over a one-year time horizon. As a borrower migrates between risk ratings, the PD associated with the borrower also changes.\\nWe employ a master scale with 14 BRRs above default, and PDs are assigned to each rating within an asset class to reflect the long-run average\\nof one-year default rates over an economic cycle, supplemented by external benchmarking, as necessary.\\nAn LGD estimate captures the priority of claim, collateral, product and sector characteristics of the credit facility extended to a borrower. LGD\\nestimates are at the facility level.\\nAn EAD estimate captures the facility type, sector and utilization rate characteristics of the credit facility extended to a borrower. EAD estimates\\nare at the facility level. An EAD credit conversion factor is calculated for eligible facilities by comparing amounts drawn at the time of default and o ne\\nyear prior to default.\\nLGD and EAD models have been developed using internal data recorded over a multi-year period that includes at least one full economic cycle, in\\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. Results are benchmarked using external data when necessary and adjustments are incorporated into theparameters, as appropriate, to account for uncertainties. For capital purposes, the LGD and EAD parameters are calibrated to reflect downturnconditions.

CRE primarily refers to two distinct types of real estate businesses: income-producing real estate(office, industrial and retail space, and multi-family residential buildings with more than four dwelling units), including the construction of th ese\\nassets; and development of land and construction of properties for sale (subdivisions, condominiums and other types of property). Our primary focusis income-producing commercial real estate portfolios with stable operating performance, diversified portfolios, modest leverage and continuedaccess to capital, including those legally structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate investment funds and real estate operat ing\\ncompanies (REOCs), as well as pension funds and other established owners of income-producing commercial real estate.\\nOur CRE portfolio was $75.4 billion as at October 31, 2024 ($69.7 billion as at October 31, 2023) and accounted for 11% of total gross loans and\\nacceptances (10% as at October 31, 2023). The portfolio is well-managed, with consistent and conservative underwriting standards, strict lendingcriteria and structural resilience. As at October 31, 2024, impaired loans represented 1% of the portfolio (1% as at October 31, 2023).\\nOur CRE portfolio is well-diversified across businesses, property types and geographic regions. Given the widespread adoption of remote and\\nhybrid work arrangements, office space is one of the higher-risk portfolio segments within commercial real estate. Office CRE was $7.7 billion as atOctober 31, 2024, including $5.5 billion in the United States ($8.3 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, as at October 31, 2023). In addition tomonitoring the limits we set for the CRE portfolio, we apply lower limits on each segment, including office space, which helps us mitigate exposure torelated risks.\\nReal Estate Secured Lending\\nReal estate secured lending comprises residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) we extend to individuals, secured byresidential real estate, which is defined as residential structures with one to four dwelling units. The increases in prime interest rates duringfiscal 2022 and 2023 impacted variable-rate mortgages, resulting in extended and negative amortization. Customer actions and decreases in interes t\\nrates in fiscal 2024 have reduced extended and negative amortization compared with the prior year.

We manage loans through a credit risk framework, which includes structural elements, limits and risk mitigation. As atOctober 31, 2024, total leveraged loans outstanding, gross of risk mitigation, were $31.9 billion and represented 2% of total assets ($29.5 billionand 2%, respectively, as at October 31, 2023), of which $10.0 billion or 31% outstanding ($9.4 billion or 32% as at October 31, 2023) represented alower level of credit risk due to high-quality collateral assets, including asset-based lending and real estate. The remainder of the portfolio is we ll-\\ndiversified across sectors and includes loans to borrowers where we have relatively small hold sizes. As at October 31, 2024, $1.3 billion or 4% of allleveraged finance loans were classified as impaired ($589 million or 2% as at October 31, 2023). This portfolio is closely managed by specializedteams and within a limit structure. In addition to originating leveraged finance loans, we also underwrite leveraged finance loans, which is managedthrough the market risk framework.\\n(1) Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.\\n82BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 71\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Gross Impaired Loans\\nTotal gross impaired loans and acceptances (GIL) were $5,843 million, an increase from $3,960 million in the prior year. The increase in impairedloans was predominantly in business and government lending, with increases in several sectors.

We maintain both an allowance for credit losses on impaired loans and an allowance for credit losses onperforming loans, in accordance with IFRS. An allowance on performing loans is maintained to cover impairment in the existing portfolio for loansthat have not yet been individually identified as impaired. Our approach to establishing and maintaining the allowance on performing loans is basedon the requirements of IFRS, considering the guideline issued by our regulator, OSFI. Under the IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) expected credit\\nloss (ECL) methodology, an allowance is recorded for ECL on financial assets regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. We recognizean allowance for loss at an amount generally based on 12 months of ECL, if the credit risk at the reporting date has not increased significantly sinceinitial recognition (Stage 1). We record ECL over the remaining life of performing financial assets that are considered to have experienced a signifi cant\\nincrease in credit risk (Stage 2).\\nAn allowance on impaired loans is maintained to reduce the carrying value of individually identified impaired loans (Stage 3) to the expected\\nrecoverable amount.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) at a level that we consider appropriate to absorb credit-related losses. As at October 31, 2024,\\nthe total ACL was $4,936 million, an increase of $669 million from the prior year, reflecting higher allowances on both performing and impaired loans.The allowance on impaired loans was $731 million as at October 31, 2024, and the allowance on performing loans was $4,205 million. Theseamounts included an allowance on impaired loans of $78 million and an allowance on performing loans of $502 million, related to undrawncommitments and letters of credit that are considered other credit instruments and recorded in other liabilities. The allowance on impaired loansincreased $36 million from $695 million in the prior year. The allowance on performing loans increased $633 million from $3,572 million in the prioryear, primarily driven by portfolio credit migration, uncertainty in credit conditions and model updates, partially offset by improvement in themacroeconomic outlook, including the adoption of a fourth economic scenario, and the impact of the sale of a portfolio of recreational vehicle loans.\\nFurther details on the key assumptions used in the measurement of ACL can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section;\\ncontinuity in ACL by each product type can be found in Tables 71 and 72 in the Supplemental Information and in Note 4 of the audited annualconsolidated financial statements.\\nInternational Exposures\\nBMO’s geographic exposures to regions outside of Canada and the United States are subject to a risk management framework that incorporatesassessments of economic and political risks in each region or country. These exposures are also managed within limits based on product, entity andcountry of ultimate risk. Our total net exposure to these regions is set out in the table below.\\nThe table outlines total net exposure for funded lending and undrawn commitments, securities (including cash products, traded credit and credit\\ndefault swap activity), repo-style transactions and derivatives.

The magnitude and importance of these\\nactivities to the enterprise, along with the potential volatility of market variables, call for diligent governance and a robust market risk managem ent\\nframework that can provide effective identification, measurement, reporting and control of market risk exposures.\\nTrading and Underwriting Market Risk Governance\\nOur market risk-taking activities are subject to an extensive governance framework. The Risk Review Committee (RRC) oversees the managementof market risk on behalf of the Board of Directors and approves limits governing market risk exposures that are consistent with our risk appetite.The Risk Management Committee (RMC) regularly reviews and assesses significant market risk exposures and positions, and exercises ongoingsenior management oversight of our risk-taking activities. Both of these committees are kept apprised of specific market risk exposures and anydevelopments that could expose BMO to unusual, unexpected or unquantified risks associated with those market risk exposures, as well as othercurrent and emerging market risks. In addition, all businesses and individuals authorized to conduct trading and underwriting activities on behalf of\\nBMO are required to work within our governance framework and, as part of their first-line-of-defence responsibilities, they must adhere to allrelevant corporate policies, standards and procedures, and maintain and manage market risk exposures within specified limits and risk tolerances.In support of our risk governance framework, our market risk management framework comprises processes, infrastructure and supportingdocumentation which together support the identification, assessment, independent monitoring and control of our market risk exposures.\\nTrading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nOur trading and underwriting businesses give rise to market risk associated with buying and selling financial products in the course of meeting ourcustomers’ needs, such as market-making and related financing activities, and assisting clients to raise funds by way of securities issuance.\\nIdentification and Assessment of Trading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nAs the first step in the management of market risk, rigorous assessment processes are in place to identify market risk exposures associated with bothnew products and the evolving risk profile of existing products, including on- and off-balance sheet positions, trading and non-trading positions,leveraged loan, bond and equity underwriting, and market risk exposures arising from the domestic and foreign operations of our operating groups.\\nVarious metrics and techniques are then employed to measure identified market risk exposures. These include Value-at-Risk and stress tests, as\\nwell as sensitivity to market risk factors and position concentrations. Results are reported to the appropriate line of business, the RMC and RRC on aregular basis.\\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) measures the maximum loss likely to be experienced in the trading and underwriting portfolios, measured at a 99%\\nconfidence level over a one-day holding period. It incorporates the risk to the value of the bank’s trading and underwriting portfolios fromchanges in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices and their implied volatilities and correlations.\\nAlthough it is a useful indicator of risk, VaR has limitations, as with any model-driven metric. It assumes that all portfolio positions can be\\nliquidated within one day and that historical data can be used as a proxy to forecast future market events. In addition, VaR calculations are basedon portfolio positions at the close of business and do not reflect the impact of intra-day activity.\\nStress Tests are used to determine the potential impact of low-frequency, high-severity events on the trading and underwriting portfolios.\\nThe portfolios are measured daily against a variety of hypothetical and historical event scenarios, including the 2008 global financial crisis and t he\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, along with portfolio-specific impacts and asset class scenarios. Scenarios are continuously refined to reflect the latest mark et\\nconditions and portfolio risk exposures. Market liquidity horizons are reviewed for suitability and scenarios updated where appropriate. In addit ion,\\na range of assumptions, including the duration of the scenario and management actions, are incorporated in the stress tests to better reflect theanticipated impact on the trading and underwriting business.\\nVaR and stress testing metrics should not be viewed as definitive predictors of the maximum amount of losses that could be experienced in the\\ntrading and underwriting portfolios in any one day, as their results are based on models and estimates and are subject to confidence levels, and theestimates could be exceeded under unforeseen market conditions.\\nOur VaR model is back-tested on a daily basis, assuming there are no changes to the previous day’s closing position, and isolates the effects of\\neach day’s price movements against those closing positions. The one-day 99% confidence level VaR at the local and consolidated BMO levels iscompared with the estimated daily profit and loss (P&L) that would be recorded if the portfolio composition remained unchanged. If this P&L result isnegative and its absolute value is greater than the previous day’s VaR, a back-testing exception occurs. Each exception is investigated, explained a nd\\ndocumented.\\nModels support the measurement of our exposure to the risk of adverse outcomes for income, retained earnings and capital. We use a variety of\\nmethods to verify the integrity of our risk models, including the application of back-testing against hypothetical losses and approval by anindependent model validation team. The data and correlations that underpin our models are updated frequently, so that risk metrics reflect currentmarket conditions.\\nMarket Risk RWA is calculated using a standardized approach under Basel III for trading book activities along with foreign exchange risk in the\\nbanking book. Policies defining the activities eligible for trading book capital treatment and banking book capital treatment are used to delineatein-scope activity. Exceptions to general assumptions about trading and banking book categories are reported to OSFI. Such exceptions principally a rise\\nfrom instruments that are designated as trading under IFRS but used to hedge banking book market risks, along with deferred compensation planhedging. The fair value of instruments under exception is $1,459 million net liability and $11,571 million gross.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 85\\n\\n\\n## Page 74\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nMonitoring and Control of Trading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nLimits are set for our trading and underwriting activities, and are subject to regular monitoring and reporting.

The RMC and Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) provide ongoing senior management oversight of risk positionsand related activities.\\nStructural Market Risk Measurement\\nInterest Rate RiskStructural interest rate risk arises when changes in interest rates affect the market value, cash flows and earnings of assets and liabilities relate d\\nto our banking activities. The objective of structural interest rate risk management is to maintain high-quality earnings and maximize sustainableproduct spreads, while managing risk to the economic value of our net assets arising from changes in interest rates.\\nStructural interest rate risk primarily comprises interest rate mismatch risk and product-embedded option risk.Interest rate mismatch risk arises when there are differences in the scheduled maturities, repricing dates or reference rates of assets, liabilitie s\\nand derivatives. The net interest rate mismatch, representing residual assets funded by common shareholders’ equity, is managed to align with atarget maturity profile through interest rate swaps and securities.\\nProduct-embedded option risk arises when product features allow customers to alter the timing of cash flows, such as scheduled maturity or\\nrepricing dates, usually in response to changes in market conditions. Product-embedded options include loan prepayments, deposit redemptionprivileges and committed rates on unadvanced mortgages. Product-embedded options and associated customer behaviour are captured in riskmodelling, and hedging programs may be used to limit the level of exposure to this risk.\\nStructural interest rate risk is measured using simulations, analyses of the sensitivity of earnings and economic value, stress testing and gap\\nanalysis, in addition to other risk metrics.\\nEarnings Sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the projected 12-month pre-tax net income from a portfolio\\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions in response to presc ribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at z ero.\\nEconomic Value Sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the market value of a portfolio of assets, liabilities\\nand off-balance sheet positions in response to prescribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at zero.\\nThe models that measure structural interest rate risk incorporate project ed changes in interest rates and predi ct the likely reaction of our custome rs to\\nthese changes. For customer loans and deposits with scheduled maturit y and repricing dates (such as mortgages and term deposits), the models\\nmeasure the extent to which customers are likely to use embedded options to alter those scheduled dates and timing. For customer loans and deposits\\nwithout scheduled maturity and repricing dates (such as credit card loans a nd chequing accounts), exposure is measured using models that adjust for\\nelasticity in product pricing and reflect historical and forecasted trend s in balances. The results generated by these structural market risk model sa r e\\ninherently uncertain, as they reflect potential future pricing and custom er behaviour, which may differ from actual experience. These models have b een\\ndeveloped using statistical analysis and are independently validated an d periodically updated through regula r model performance assessment, bac k-\\ntesting and ongoing dialogue with the lines of busi ness. Models developed to predict customer beha viour are also used to support product pricing.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 87\\n\\n\\n## Page 76\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAll models are subject to BMO’s Model Risk Management Framework, which is described in more detail in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management\\nFramework section.\\nThe sensitivity of structural interest rate earnings and economic value to an immediate parallel increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the\\nyield curve is disclosed in the table below.\\nThe sensitivity of structural economic value to rising interest rates primarily reflects a lower market value for fixed-rate loans. The sensitivity of\\nstructural economic value to falling interest rates primarily reflects the impact of a higher market value for fixed-rate loans and minimum modelledclient deposit rates. The exposure of structural economic value to rising interest rates and the benefits of falling interest rates decreased relati ve to\\nOctober 31, 2023, primarily due to modelled deposit pricing being less rate sensitive at lower projected interest rate levels following the decrease in\\nterm market rates during the year. Structural earnings sensitivity quantifies the potential impact of interest rate changes on structural balance s heet\\npre-tax net income over the next 12 months. The sensitivity of structural earnings to falling interest rates primarily reflects the risk of fixed-rat e and\\nfloating-rate loans repricing at lower rates and the more limited ability to reduce deposit pricing as rates fall. The benefits of rising interest rat es to\\nstructural earnings primarily reflect the positive impact of reinvesting our net equity and non-rate sensitive deposits into assets with higher-te rm\\nrates. The benefits of rising interest rates to structural earnings increased modestly relative to October 31, 2023. The exposure of falling interes t rates\\nto structural earnings decreased relative to October 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of modelled prepayment penalty fee collection on certainprepayable instruments.\\nDuring 2024, both economic value sensitivity and earnings sensitivity remained within the limits established by the Board of Directors.\\nStructural Interest Rate Sensitivity(1) (2)\\nTABLE 45\\nEconomic value sensitivity Earnings sensitivity\\n(Pre-tax Canadian $ equivalent in millions)October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023\\nCanada (3) United States Total Total Canada (3) United States Total Total\\n100 basis point increase (693) (790) (1,483) (1,849) 139 228 367 304\\n100 basis point decrease 597 63 660 1,492 (101) (109) (210) (325)\\n(1) Losses are presented in brackets and gains are presented as positive numbers.\\n(2) Interest rate sensitivities assume an immediate and sustained parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at the end of the period, using a constant balance sheet.\\n(3) Includes Canadian dollar and other currencies.\\nThe table below presents net loans and acceptances by interest rate sensitivity.\\nTABLE 46\\n(Canadian $ in millions) 2024 2023\\nFixed rate (1)\\nContractual amounts that will reprice/repay within 3 months 213,314 213,854\\nContractual amounts that will reprice/repay after 3 months 254,872 248,688\\nFloating rate (2) 202,031 186,327\\nNon-rate sensitive (3) 8,158 15,907\\nTotal 678,375 664,776\\n(1) Includes index-based loans.\\n(2) Floating rate only includes loans that reprice immediately upon a change in interest rates.(3) Includes credit card balances that are paid when due, customers’ liability under acceptances, impaired loans and allowance for credit losses.\\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified for changes in accounting policy.\\nInsurance Market Risk\\nInsurance market risk includes interest rate and equity market risk arising from the activities of our BMO Insurance business. During the 2024 fiscal\\nyear, we entered into hedging arrangements to offset the impact of changes in interest rates and equity market values on our earnings. Thesensitivity includes the impact of these hedging relationships. The impact of insurance market risk on earnings is reflected in insurance investmen t\\nresults on our Consolidated Statement of Income, and the corresponding change in insurance contract liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.The impact of insurance market risk is not reflected in the Structural Interest Rate Sensitivity table above.\\nThe bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) effective November 1, 2023. IFRS 17 changes the fundamental principles used to\\nrecognize and measure insurance contracts, including life insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts held and investment contracts with discret ionary\\nparticipation features. This change impacts the timing of when investment-related income emerges and the associated market risk sensitivities, asthe discount rates used to calculate the present value of insurance liabilities are no longer based on the assets supporting those liabilities, but ra ther\\non the features of the insurance liabilities themselves. As such, insurance market risk largely reflects the interest rate risk arising from a mismat ch in\\nliability and asset cash flows.\\nOn transition, we applied the full retrospective approach to our creditor business and the fair value approach to all other products written prior to\\nNovember 1, 2022.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\n88BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 77\\n\\n                          MD&A                          The table below reflects the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, our net income to certain changes in interest rates, and includes the\\nestimated impact of hedging arrangements.\\nTABLE 47\\n(Pre-tax Canadian $ in millions) 2024 (1) 2023\\n50 basis point increase 6 23\\n50 basis point decrease (9) (30)\\n(1) Interest rate sensitivities assume a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at the end of the period, with no chan ge in the ultimate risk-free rate.\\nFor further information, refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section and Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial\\nstatements. In addition, information on insurance risk governance can be found in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section.\\nNon-Trading Foreign Exchange Risk\\nStructural foreign exchange risk arises primarily from translation risk related to our net investment in U.S. operations and from transaction riskassociated with U.S.-dollar-denominated net income.\\nTranslation risk arises from the potential impact that changes in foreign exchange rates could have on our reported shareholders’ equity and\\ncapital ratios. We economically manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our capital ratios. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital\\nManagement section for further discussion.\\nTransaction risk arises from the potential impact that fluctuations in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate could have on the Canadian\\ndollar equivalent of BMO’s U.S.-dollar-denominated financial results. Exchange rate fluctuations will affect future results measured in Canadia n dollars,\\nand the impact on those results is a function of the periods during which revenues, expenses and provisions for credit losses arise. Hedging positionsmay be taken to partially offset the pre-tax effects of Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations on financial results, although we did not\\nenter into any hedging arrangements in the current or prior year. If future results are consistent with results in fiscal 2024, each one cent increase(decrease) in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate would be expected to increase (decrease) the Canadian dollar equivalent of U.S. segmentnet income before income taxes for the year by $26 million, in the absence of hedging arrangements.

Insurance provides protection against the financial consequences of insured risks by transferring those risks to the insurer (underspecific terms and conditions) in exchange for premiums. Insurance risk is inherent in all of our insurance products: life insurance, annuities (whi ch\\ninclude the pension risk transfer business), accident and sickness insurance, and creditor insurance, as well as the reinsurance business. Insuran ce risk\\nconsists of:\\n‰Claims risk – the risk that the actual magnitude or frequency of claims will differ from those assumed in the pricing or underwriting process,including mortality risk, morbidity risk, longevity risk and catastrophic risk.\\n‰Policyholder behaviour risk – the risk that the behaviour of policyholders in regard to premium payments, withdrawals or loans, as well as policylapses and surrenders and other voluntary terminations, will differ from the behaviour assumed in the pricing process.\\n‰Expense risk – the risk that actual expenses arising from acquiring and administering policies and processing claims will exceed the expensesassumed in the pricing process.\\nOur risk governance practices provide effective independent oversight and control of risk within BMO Insurance. BMO Insurance’s risk management\\nframework addresses the identification, assessment, management, monitoring and reporting of risks. The framework includes: the Risk AppetiteStatement and key risk metrics; insurance risk policies and processes, including limits; capital requirements; stress testing; risk reports; the O wn Risk\\nand Solvency Assessment; and ongoing monitoring of experience. Senior management within the various lines of business uses this framework,serving as the first line of defence and assuming the primary responsibility for managing insurance risk. Second-line-of-defence oversight is prov ided\\nby the CRO, BMO Insurance, who reports to the CRO, BMO Wealth Management. Internal risk committees, the boards of directors of the BMO Insurancesubsidiaries and senior management provide senior governance and review. In particular, the Risk Committee of BMO Insurance oversees and reportson risk management activities to the insurance companies’ boards of directors on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Audit and Conduct ReviewCommittee of the Board of Directors acts as the Audit and Conduct Review Committee for BMO Life Insurance Company.\\nA robust product approval process is a cornerstone of the BMO Insurance risk management framework, as it identifies, assesses and manages\\nrisks associated with new insurance products or changes to existing products. This process, along with guidelines and practices for underwriting an d\\nclaims management, promotes the effective identification, assessment and management of insurance risk. Reinsurance transactions that transfer o r\\ncede insurance risk from BMO Insurance to independent reinsurance companies also mitigate our exposure to insurance risk by diversifying risk andlimiting claims. BMO Insurance has exited the Property and Casualty Reinsurance market, with the last remaining treaty terminated in January 2021,significantly reducing our exposure to catastrophic claims and, in turn, the risks arising from climate change. However, a certain portion of ourexposure to catastrophic claims remains as the portfolio runs off and until all outstanding claims that were made prior to the treaty termination date s\\nare settled and paid.\\nThe table below presents the sensitivities before and after risk mitigation by reinsurance and assumes that all other variables remain constant.\\nTABLE 49\\n2024 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions)Contractual service margin Profit or loss Contractual service margin Profit or loss\\nGross Net Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net\\nPolicy-related assumptions\\nMortality rates (1% increase) (1) (17) 10 1 1 (14) 9 – –\\nLapse rates (10% increase) (2) (151) (52) (10) (4) (161) (63) (4) (2)\\nExpenses (5% increase) (3) (15) (15) – – (9) (9) – –\\n(1) Mortality relates to the occurrence of death and is a key assumption for our life insurance business.\\n(2) Policies are terminated through lapses and surrenders, where lapses represent the termination of policies due to non-payment of premiums and sur renders represent the voluntary termination of\\npolicies by policyholders.\\n(3) Directly attributable operating expense assumptions reflect the projected costs of maintaining and servicing in-force policies, including as sociated directly attributable overhead expenses.\\nCaution\\nThis Insurance Risk section contains forward-looking statements.

Financial commitments include liabilities to depositors and suppliers, as well as lending, investment and pledging commitments.\\nManaging liquidity and funding risk is integral to maintaining enterprise soundness and safety, depositor confidence and earnings stability. It is BMO’s\\npolicy to maintain a level of liquid assets and funding capacity sufficient to meet our financial commitments, even in times of stress.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Governance\\nThe Corporate Treasury group and the operating groups, as the first line of defence, are responsible for the ongoing identification, assessment andmanagement of liquidity and funding risk. The Corporate Treasury group is responsible for monitoring and reporting on exposures to liquidity andfunding risk across the enterprise; develops and recommends for approval the Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework and the relatedrisk appetite statement and limits; monitors compliance with relevant corporate policies; and assesses the impact of market events on liquidity andfunding requirements on an ongoing basis.\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM), as the second line of defence, exercises oversight, conducts independent risk assessment and\\nprovides effective challenge of liquidity and funding management frameworks, policies, limits, monitoring and reporting across the enterprise.\\nThe Risk Management Committee (RMC) and Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) provide senior management oversight, and review and discuss\\nsignificant liquidity and funding policies, issues and developments that arise in the pursuit of BMO’s strategic priorities. The Risk Review Commit tee\\n(RRC) provides oversight of the management of liquidity and funding risk, annually approves the applicable policies, limits and contingency plan, a nd\\nregularly reviews liquidity and funding positions.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Management\\nBMO’s Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework is defined and authorized in alignment with corporate policies approved by our Board ofDirectors and standards approved by management. These policies and standards set out key management principles, liquidity and funding metricsand related limits, as well as roles and responsibilities in the management of liquidity and funding risk across the enterprise.\\nWe have a robust limit structure in place in order to manage liquidity and funding risk. These limits define BMO’s risk appetite for the key Stress\\nNet Liquidity Position (Stress NLP) measure, regulatory liquidity ratios, secured and unsecured funding appetite (for both trading and structuralactivities), as well as enterprise collateral pledging. Limits also establish the tolerance for concentrations of maturities, as well as requireme nts for\\ncounterparty liability diversification, business pledging activity, and the size and type of committed and uncommitted credit and liquidity facil ities that\\nmay be outstanding.\\nOperating within these limits helps to confirm that liquidity and funding risk is appropriately managed. An enterprise-wide contingency plan\\nintended to facilitate effective risk management in the event of a disruption is also in place. Early warning indicators identified in the contingenc y\\nplan are regularly monitored in order to detect any signs of rising levels of liquidity or funding risk in the market, or any exposure to other risksspecific to BMO.\\nBMO legal entities include regulated and foreign subsidiaries and branches, and as a result, movements of funds between entities in the\\ncorporate group are subject to, among other things, the liquidity, funding and capital adequacy requirements of these entities. As such, liquidity a nd\\nfunding positions are managed on both a consolidated and key legal entity basis. Liquidity and funding risk management policies and limits, informedby the laws and regulations that apply to each entity, are in place for key legal entities, and positions are regularly reviewed at the key legal entitylevel to confirm compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\\nBMO continued to maintain a strong liquidity position during fiscal 2024. Customer loans and deposits continued to grow, while wholesale\\nfunding decreased, reflecting net maturities. Our liquidity metrics, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NS FR),\\nexceeded internal targets and regulatory requirements throughout fiscal 2024.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Measurement\\nA key component of liquidity risk management is the measurement of liquidity risk under stress. We use Stress NLP as a key measure of liquidity risk.Stress NLP represents the amount by which liquid assets exceed potential funding needs under severe systemic and enterprise-specific stressscenarios, and a combination thereof. Potential funding needs may arise from obligations to repay retail, commercial and wholesale deposits that ar e\\nwithdrawn or not renewed, or to fund drawdowns on available credit and liquidity lines, as well as from obligations to pledge collateral due to ratingsdowngrades or market volatility, along with the continuing need to fund new assets and strategic investments. Potential funding needs are quantifie d\\nby applying factors to various business activities based on management’s view of the relative level of liquidity risk related to each activity. Thesefactors vary by deposit classification (e.g., retail, small business, non-financial corporate or wholesale counterparties) and deposit type (e.g ., insured,\\nuninsured, operational or non-operational deposits), as well as by commitment type (e.g., committed or uncommitted credit or liquidity facilities by\\ncounterparty type). Stress scenarios also consider the time horizon over which liquid assets can be monetized and management’s assessment of theliquidity value of those assets under conditions of market stress. These potential funding needs are assessed under severe systemic and enterprise-specific stress scenarios, and a combination thereof.\\nStress testing results are evaluated against our stated risk appetite and are considered in management’s decisions on limit-setting and internal\\nliquidity transfer pricing, and they also help to inform and shape the design of business plans and contingency plans. The Liquidity and Funding RiskManagement Framework is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing.\\nIn addition to Stress NLP, we regularly monitor positions in relation to the limits and liquidity ratios noted in the Liquidity and Funding Risk\\nManagement section above. These include regulatory metrics such as LCR, Net Cumulative Cash Flow and NSFR.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 91\\n\\n\\n## Page 80\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nUnencumbered Liquid Assets\\nUnencumbered liquid assets include high-quality assets that are marketable, can be pledged as security for borrowings, and can be converted to cash\\nin a time frame that meets liquidity and funding requirements. Liquid assets are primarily held in our trading businesses, as well as in supplementalliquidity pools that are maintained for contingent liquidity risk management purposes. The liquidity values recognized for different asset classes under\\nBMO’s risk management framework reflect management’s assessment of the liquidity values of those assets under a severe stress scenario. Liquidassets held in our trading businesses comprise cash on deposit with central banks, short-term deposits with other financial institutions, highly-r ated\\ndebt securities, equity securities and short-term reverse repurchase agreements. Supplemental liquidity pool assets primarily comprise cash ondeposit with central banks, securities, and short-term reverse repurchase agreements for highly-rated Canadian federal and provincial governmen t\\ndebt and U.S. federal government and agency debt. Substantially all supplemental liquidity pool assets meet the definition of high-quality liquidassets under Basel III. The size of the supplemental liquidity pool is integrated with our assessment of liquidity risk. In order to comply with localregulatory requirements, certain legal entities maintain their own minimum liquidity positions. There may be legal and regulatory restrictions onBMO’s ability to use liquid assets held at one legal entity to support the liquidity requirements of another legal entity.\\nIn the normal course of business, we may encumber a portion of cash and securities holdings as collateral in support of trading activities and\\nparticipation in clearing and payment systems in Canada and abroad. In addition, we may receive liquid assets as collateral and may re-pledge theseassets in exchange for cash or as collateral in support of trading activities. Net unencumbered liquid assets, defined as on-balance sheet assets, su ch\\nas BMO-owned cash and securities and securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, plus other off-balance sheet eligible collateralreceived, less assets encumbered as collateral, totalled $396.3 billion as at October 31, 2024, compared with $357.9 billion as at October 31, 2023.\\nThe increase in unencumbered liquid assets was primarily due to higher securities balances, partially offset by lower cash balances. Net\\nunencumbered liquid assets are primarily held at the parent bank level, at BMO Bank N.A. and in our broker/dealer operations. In addition to liquidassets, we have access to the Bank of Canada’s lending assistance programs, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window in the United States, theBank of England’s Sterling Monetary Framework and European Central Bank standby liquidity facilities. We do not consider central bank facilities asource of available liquidity when assessing the soundness of our liquidity position.\\nIn addition to cash and securities holdings, we may also pledge other assets, including mortgages and loans, to raise long-term secured funding.\\nAs part of the Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework, a Pledging of Assets corporate policy sets out the framework and limits forpledging financial and non-financial assets.\\nBMO’s total encumbered assets and unencumbered liquid assets are summarized in the table below.

Secured and unsecured wholesale funding for liquidtrading assets is largely shorter-term (maturing in one year or less), is aligned with the liquidity of the assets being funded and is subject to limits on\\naggregate maturities across different periods. Supplemental liquidity pools are funded largely with wholesale term funding.\\nWe maintain a large and stable base of customer deposits that, in combination with our strong capital position, is a source of strength. This\\nsupports the maintenance of a sound liquidity position and reduces our reliance on wholesale funding. Customer deposits totalled $715.3 billion asat October 31, 2024, increasing from $654.3 billion in fiscal 2023, driven by strong underlying deposit growth across all business groups.\\nTotal secured and unsecured wholesale funding outstanding, which largely consists of negotiable marketable securities, was $255.5 billion as at\\nOctober 31, 2024, with $67.5 billion sourced as secured funding and $188.0 billion sourced as unsecured funding. Total wholesale funding outstandin g\\ndecreased from $269.6 billion as at October 31, 2023, primarily due to net maturities of wholesale funding during the year. The mix and maturities ofBMO’s wholesale term funding are outlined later in this section. Additional information on deposit maturities can also be found in the ContractualMaturities of Assets and Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments section. We maintain a sizeable portfolio of unencumbered liquid assets,totalling $396.3 billion as at October 31, 2024 and $357.9 billion as at October 31, 2023, that can be monetized to meet potential fundingrequirements, as described in the Unencumbered Liquid Assets section above.\\nWholesale Funding Maturities(1)\\nTABLE 53\\nAs at October 31, 2024 As at October 31, 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions)Less than\\n1 month1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o1 2\\nmonthsSubtotal less\\nthan 1 year1t o2\\nyearsOver\\n2 years Total Total\\nDeposits from banks 2,531 1,283 556 1,222 5,592 7 – 5,599 7,714\\nCertificates of deposit and commercial\\npaper 12,023 23,099 23,525 30,838 89,485 864 – 90,349 94,372\\nBearer deposit notes 1,437 2,332 462 407 4,638 – – 4,638 954\\nAsset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) 1,702 2,453 5,114 343 9,612 – – 9,612 6,005\\nSenior unsecured medium-term notes 609 5,120 3,096 12,443 21,268 7,374 39,271 67,913 70,749\\nSenior unsecured structured notes (2) – – 14 297 311 498 10,283 11,092 9,415\\nSecured funding\\nMortgage and HELOC securitizations 25 781 909 1,474 3,189 2,752 12,246 18,187 17,916\\nCovered bonds – – – 4,117 4,117 12,267 10,585 26,969 28,412\\nOther asset-backed securitizations (3) ––––– 1,330 5,786 7,116 7,661\\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances – – – 1,460 1,460 1,391 2,782 5,633 18,148\\nSubordinated debt ––––– 2 5 8,378 8,403 8,227\\nTotal 18,327 35,068 33,676 52,601 139,672 26,508 89,331 255,511 269,573\\nOf which:\\nSecured 1,727 3,234 6,023 7,394 18,378 17,740 31,399 67,517 78,142\\nUnsecured 16,600 31,834 27,653 45,207 121,294 8,768 57,932 187,994 191,431\\nTotal (4) 18,327 35,068 33,676 52,601 139,672 26,508 89,331 255,511 269,573\\n(1) Wholesale unsecured funding primarily includes funding raised through the issuance of negotiable marketable securities.

The funding plan\\nconsiders expected maturities, as well as asset and liability growth projected for businesses in our forecasting and planning processes, and assess es\\nfunding needs in relation to the sources available. The plan is reviewed annually by the senior management committees with specific relatedresponsibilities and approved by the RRC, and is regularly updated to reflect actual results and incorporate updated forecast information.\\nRegulatory Developments\\nOSFI has announced proposed changes to its Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline that are expected to become effective in fiscal 2025.Under the proposal, BMO will be required to regularly file reports related to intraday liquidity management with OSFI. These changes are not expectedto have a material impact on our liquidity and funding practices.\\nCredit Ratings\\nThe credit ratings assigned to BMO’s short-term and senior long-term debt securities by external rating agencies are important in raising both capit al\\nand funding to support the bank’s business operations. Maintaining strong credit ratings allows us to access the wholesale markets at competitivepricing levels. Should BMO’s credit ratings experience a downgrade, our cost of funding may increase and our access to funding and capital throughthe wholesale markets could be constrained. A material downgrade of BMO’s ratings could also have other consequences, including those set out inNote 8 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe credit ratings assigned to BMO’s senior debt by rating agencies are indicative of high-grade, high-quality issues. In fiscal 2024, Moody’s,\\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch and DBRS affirmed their ratings and maintained their stable outlook on BMO.\\nTABLE 54\\nAs at October 31, 2024\\nRating agency Short-term debt Senior debt (1)Long-term deposits /\\nLegacy senior debt (2)Subordinated\\ndebt (NVCC) Outlook\\nMoody’s P-1 A2 Aa2 Baa1 (hyb) Stable\\nS&P A-1 A- A+ BBB+ StableFitch F1+ AA- AA A StableDBRS R-1 (high) AA (low) AA A (low) Stable\\n(1) Subject to conversion under the Bank Recapitalization (Bail-In) Regime.\\n(2) Long-term deposits / Legacy senior debt includes senior debt issued prior to September 23, 2018 and senior debt issued on or after September 23, 201 8 that is excluded from the Bank\\nRecapitalization (Bail-In) Regime.\\nWe are required to deliver collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of BMO’s current credit rating. The incremental collatera l\\nrequired is based on mark-to-market exposure, collateral valuations and collateral threshold arrangements, as applicable. As at October 31, 2024, we\\nwould be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties totalling $189 million, $440 million and $979 million as a result of a one-notch ,\\ntwo-notch and three-notch downgrade, respectively.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 95\\n\\n\\n## Page 84\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio\\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is calculated on a daily basis as the ratio of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) held to total net stressed cash\\noutflows over the next 30 calendar days, in accordance with OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline, and is summarized in the table below.BMO’s HQLA primarily comprises cash, highly-rated debt issued or backed by governments, highly-rated covered bonds and non-financial corporatedebt, and non-financial equities that are part of a major stock index. Net cash flows include outflows from deposits, secured and unsecured wholesalefunding, commitments and potential collateral requirements, offset by permitted inflows from loans, securities lending activities and other non- HQLA\\ndebt maturing over a 30-day horizon. Weightings prescribed by OSFI are applied to cash flows and HQLA to arrive at the weighted values and the LCR.The LCR does not reflect liquidity in BMO Financial Corp. (BFC) in excess of 100%, because of limitations on the transfer of liquidity between BFC andthe parent bank. Canadian domestic systemically important banks, including BMO, are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. The averagedaily LCR for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 was 132%, equivalent to a surplus of $61.0 billion above the regulatory minimum. The LCRincreased 4% from 128% in fiscal 2023, as higher HQLA more than offset an increase in net cash outflows. While banks are required to maintain anLCR of greater than 100% in normal conditions, they are also expected to be able to utilize HQLA during a period of stress, which may result in an LCRof less than 100% during such a period. The LCR is only one measure of a bank’s liquidity position and does not fully capture all of its liquid assets orthe funding alternatives that may be available during a period of stress. BMO’s total liquid assets are shown in the table below.\\nTABLE 55\\nAs at October 31, 2024\\n(Canadian $ in billions, except as noted)Total unweighted value\\n(average) (1) (2)Total weighted value\\n(average) (2) (3)\\nHigh-Quality Liquid Assets\\nTotal high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) * 253.4\\nCash Outflows\\nRetail deposits and deposits from small business customers, of which: 302.3 21.7\\nStable deposits 139.9 4.2\\nLess stable deposits 162.4 17.5\\nUnsecured wholesale funding, of which: 312.7 137.4\\nOperational deposits (all counterparties) and deposits in networks of cooperative banks 153.5 38.0\\nNon-operational deposits (all counterparties) 140.0 80.2\\nUnsecured debt 19.2 19.2\\nSecured wholesale funding * 23.0\\nAdditional requirements, of which: 258.7 52.4\\nOutflows related to derivatives exposures and other collateral requirements 32.4 8.7\\nOutflows related to loss of funding on debt products 2.7 2.7\\nCredit and liquidity facilities 223.6 41.0\\nOther contractual funding obligations 0.8 –\\nOther contingent funding obligations 544.3 11.3\\nTotal cash outflows * 245.8\\nCash Inflows\\nSecured lending (e.g., reverse repos) 164.0 24.1\\nInflows from fully performing exposures 18.1 9.9\\nOther cash inflows 19.4 19.4\\nTotal cash inflows 201.5 53.4\\nTotal adjusted value (4)\\nTotal HQLA 253.4\\nTotal net cash outflows 192.4\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (%) 132\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2023 Total adjusted value (4)\\nTotal HQLA 228.4\\nTotal net cash outflows 178.5\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (%) 128\\n* Disclosure is not required under the LCR disclosure standard.\\n(1) Unweighted values are calculated at market value (for HQLA) or as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflo ws).\\n(2) Values are calculated based on the simple average of the daily LCR over 62 business days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.(3) Weighted values are calculated after the application of the weights prescribed under the OSFI Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline f or HQLA and cash inflows and outflows.\\n(4) Adjusted values are calculated based on total weighted values after applicable caps, as defined in the LAR Guideline.\\n96BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 85\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Net Stable Funding Ratio\\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a regulatory metric that assesses the stability of a bank’s funding profile in relation to the liquidity value of its\\nassets and is calculated in accordance with OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline. Unlike the LCR, which is a short-term metric, the NSFRassesses a bank’s medium-term and long-term resilience. The NSFR is defined as the ratio of the amount of available stable funding (ASF) to theamount of required stable funding (RSF). ASF represents the proportion of own and third-party resources that are expected to be reliably available toa bank over a one-year time horizon (including customer deposits, long-term wholesale funding and capital). The stable funding requirements foreach institution are set by OSFI based on the liquidity and maturity characteristics of its balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures.Weightings prescribed by OSFI are applied to notional asset and liability balances to determine ASF, RSF and the NSFR. Canadian domestic systemicall y\\nimportant banks, including BMO, are required to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%. BMO’s NSFR was 117% as at October 31, 2024, equivalent to asurplus of $115.4 billion above the regulatory minimum. The NSFR increased from 115% as at October 31, 2023, as higher ASF more than offset theincrease in RSF.\\nTABLE 56\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2024\\nUnweighted value by residual maturity\\nWeighted\\nvalue (2) (Canadian $ in billions, except as noted)No\\nmaturity (1)Less than 6\\nmonths6t o1 2\\nmonths Over 1 year\\nAvailable Stable Funding (ASF) Item\\nCapital: – – – 95.4 95.4\\nRegulatory capital – – – 95.4 95.4\\nOther capital instruments –– –– –\\nRetail deposits and deposits from small business customers: 227.4 70.2 41.8 74.4 379.8\\nStable deposits 114.2 27.5 17.3 15.4 166.5\\nLess stable deposits 113.2 42.7 24.5 59.0 213.3\\nWholesale funding: 310.0 275.0 66.4 106.4 293.0\\nOperational deposits 151.0 – – – 75.5\\nOther wholesale funding 159.0 275.0 66.4 106.4 217.5\\nLiabilities with matching interdependent assets – 1.3 0.6 13.9 –\\nOther liabilities: 3.0 * * 77.5 20.5\\nNSFR derivative liabilities ** * 5 . 3 *\\nAll other liabilities and equity not included in the above categories 3.0 51.5 0.3 20.4 20.5\\nTotal ASF * * * * 788.7\\nRequired Stable Funding (RSF) Item\\nTotal NSFR high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) * * * * 18.5\\nDeposits held at other financial institutions for operational purposes – 0.2 – – 0.1\\nPerforming loans and securities: 202.3 211.3 74.3 362.1 538.3\\nPerforming loans to financial institutions secured by Level 1 HQLA – 94.1 3.2 – 4.0\\nPerforming loans to financial institutions secured by non-Level 1 HQLA and unsecured\\nperforming loans to financial institutions 32.0 61.5 8.7 21.3 65.0\\nPerforming loans to non-financial corporate clients, loans to retail and small business\\ncustomers, and loans to sovereigns, central banks and public sector entities, of which: 124.8 39.4 44.3 167.8 287.9\\nWith a risk weight of less than or equal to 35% under the Basel II standardized approach\\nfor credit risk –– –– –\\nPerforming residential mortgages, of which: 13.6 13.8 17.7 143.7 127.9\\nWith a risk weight of less than or equal to 35% under the Basel II standardized\\napproach for credit risk 13.6 13.8 17.7 143.7 127.9\\nSecurities that are not in default and do not qualify as HQLA, including exchange-traded equities 31.9 2.5 0.4 29.3 53.5\\nAssets with matching interdependent liabilities – 1.3 0.6 13.9 –\\nOther assets: 46.6 * * 101.7 94.6\\nPhysical traded commodities, including gold 9.5 * * * 8.1\\nAssets posted as initial margin for derivative contracts and contributions to default\\nfunds of CCPs * * * 17.7 15.0\\nNSFR derivative assets * * * 3.8 –\\nNSFR derivative liabilities before deduction of variation margin posted * * * 14.6 0.7\\nAll other assets not included in the above categories 37.1 41.0 0.3 24.3 70.8\\nOff-balance sheet items – – – 623.3 21.8\\nTotal RSF * * * * 673.3\\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (%) * * * * 117\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2023Weighted\\nvalue (2)\\nTotal ASF 724.1\\nTotal RSF 627.8\\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (%) 115\\n* Disclosure is not required under the NSFR disclosure standard.\\n(1) Items in the no maturity column do not have a stated maturity.

The\\ncontractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities is an input to, but is not necessarily consistent with, the expected maturity of assets andliabilities that is used in the management of liquidity and funding risk. We forecast asset and liability cash flows, under both normal marketconditions and a number of stress scenarios to manage liquidity and funding risk. Stress scenarios incorporate assumptions for loan repayments,deposit withdrawals, and credit commitment and liquidity facility drawdowns by counterparty and product type. Stress scenarios also consider thetime horizon over which liquid assets can be monetized and the related discounts (“haircuts”) and potential collateral requirements that may arisefrom both market volatility and credit rating downgrades, among other assumptions.\\nTABLE 57\\n2024\\n(Canadian $ in millions)0t o1\\nmonth1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o9\\nmonths9t o1 2\\nmonths1t o2\\nyears2t o5\\nyearsOver 5\\nyearsNo\\nmaturity Total\\nOn-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\\nAssets\\nCash and cash equivalents 62,827 ––––––– 2,271 65,098\\nInterest bearing deposits with banks 2,513 628 481 18 – – – – – 3,640\\nSecurities 6,787 14,011 7,840 6,707 9,720 21,264 84,775 172,886 72,890 396,880\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\\nresale agreements 85,185 16,803 5,701 2,330 888 – – – – 110,907\\nLoans (1)\\nResidential mortgages 1,683 3,284 6,413 6,653 9,252 52,489 77,867 33,227 212 191,080\\nConsumer instalment and other personal 581 974 1,703 1,827 2,671 14,815 24,595 18,830 26,691 92,687\\nCredit cards –––––––– 13,612 13,612\\nBusiness and government 8,647 14,418 16,461 19,448 21,828 63,613 105,740 32,444 102,394 384,993\\nAllowance for credit losses –––––––– (4,356) (4,356)\\nTotal loans, net of allowance 10,911 18,676 24,577 27,928 33,751 130,917 208,202 84,501 138,553 678,016\\nOther assets\\nDerivative instruments 5,573 7,996 7,211 2,482 1,660 6,365 8,374 7,592 – 47,253\\nCustomers’ liabilities under acceptances 3 5 9–––––––– 3 5 9\\nReceivable from brokers, dealers and\\nclients 31,916 –––––––– 31,916\\nOther 3,847 1,012 948 31 14 13 13 7,717 61,983 75,578\\nTotal other assets 41,695 9,008 8,159 2,513 1,674 6,378 8,387 15,309 61,983 155,106\\nTotal assets 209,918 59,126 46,758 39,496 46,033 158,559 301,364 272,696 275,697 1,409,647\\nTABLE 58\\n2024\\n(Canadian $ in millions)0t o1\\nmonth1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o9\\nmonths9t o1 2\\nmonths1t o2\\nyears2t o5\\nyearsOver 5\\nyearsNo\\nmaturity Total\\nLiabilities and Equity\\nDeposits (2) (3) 47,637 74,759 69,479 68,110 48,835 51,789 87,297 25,602 508,932 982,440\\nOther liabilities\\nDerivative instruments 6,769 10,541 10,828 3,311 2,160 6,470 9,112 9,112 – 58,303\\nAcceptances 3 5 9–––––––– 3 5 9\\nSecurities sold but not yet purchased (4) 35,030 –––––––– 35,030\\nSecurities lent or sold under repurchase\\nagreements (4) 99,364 7,777 721 106 1,016 1,807 – – – 110,791\\nSecuritization and structured entities’\\nliabilities 44 981 1,072 2,183 152 4,353 9,913 21,466 – 40,164\\nInsurance-related liabilities 93 89 18 18 30 83 195 701 17,543 18,770\\nPayable to brokers, dealers and clients 34,407 –––––––– 34,407\\nOther 12,409 2,968 805 144 1,611 2,492 4,058 2,799 9,434 36,720\\nTotal other liabilities 188,475 22,356 13,444 5,762 4,969 15,205 23,278 34,078 26,977 334,544\\nSubordinated debt ––––– 2 5 2 5 8,327 – 8,377\\nTotal equity –––––––– 84,286 84,286\\nTotal liabilities and equity 236,112 97,115 82,923 73,872 53,804 67,019 110,600 68,007 620,195 1,409,647\\n(1) Loans receivable on demand have been included under no maturity.\\n(2) Deposits payable on demand and payable after notice have been included under no maturity.(3) Deposits totalling $29,136 million as at October 31, 2024 have a fixed maturity date; however, they can be redeemed early (either fully or partiall y) by customers without penalty.

These losses can stem from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, humanerror or misconduct, and external events that may directly or indirectly impact the fair value of assets we hold in our credit or investmentportfolios. Examples of these risks include cyber and information security risk, technology risk, fraud risk and business continuity risk, but excl ude\\nlegal and regulatory risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and other types of financial risk.\\nOperational non-financial risk (ONFR) is inherent in all our business and banking activities and can lead to significant impacts on our operating and\\nfinancial results, including financial loss, restatements of financial results and damage to BMO’s reputation. Like other financial service organ izations,\\nwe are exposed to a variety of operational risks arising from potential failure of our internal processes, technology systems and employees, as wellas from external threats. Potential losses may be the result of process and control failures, unauthorized transactions by employees, businessdisruption, information security breaches, theft or fraud and cyber security threats, exposure to risks related to third-party relationships and d amage\\nto physical assets. For example, given the large volume of transactions that we process daily and the complexity and speed of our businessoperations, it is possible that certain operational or human errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.\\nONFR is not only inherent in our business and banking activities, it is also inherent in the processes and controls we use to manage risks. There is\\nthe possibility that errors could occur, as well as the possibility that a failure in our internal processes or systems could lead to a failure to manage or\\nmitigate risk, financial loss and reputational harm. Shortcomings or failures of internal processes, systems or employees, or of services and produ cts\\nprovided by third parties, including any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems, could lead to financial loss, restatements o f\\nfinancial results and damage to BMO’s reputation.\\nThe nature of our business activities also exposes us to the risk of theft and fraud when we transact with customers or counterparties. BMO relies\\non the accuracy and completeness of any information provided by, and any other representations made by, customers and counterparties. While weconduct due diligence in relation to such customer information and, where practicable and economically feasible, engage valuation experts and othe r\\nexperts or sources of information to assist in assessing the value of collateral and other customer risks, our financial results may be adverselyimpacted if the information provided by customers or counterparties is materially misleading and this is not discovered during the due diligenceprocess.\\nWe have established various risk management frameworks to manage and mitigate these risks, including internal controls, limits and\\ngovernance processes. However, despite the contingency plans we have in place to maintain our ability to serve our clients and minimize disruptionsand adverse impacts, and the contingency plans of our third-party service providers, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by adisruption to the infrastructure that supports our operations and the communities in which we do business, including, but not limited to, disruptioncaused by public health or other emergencies, civil disorder, acts of war or terrorism.\\nWe regularly review top and emerging risk exposures that could impact BMO’s business and operations, and we assess our preparedness to\\nproactively manage the risks we face or could face in the future. Consistent with the management of risk across the enterprise, we employ a three-lines-of-defence approach in managing our exposures to non-financial risk.\\nRefer to the Risks That May Affect Future Results – Top and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results section for further discussion of these\\nrisks.\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Governance\\nThe Operational Risk Committee (ORC), a sub-committee of the Risk Management Committee (RMC), is the primary governance committee exercisingoversight of all operational non-financial risk management matters, including: providing direction on, and monitoring against, strategic object ives and\\ndeliverables; and improving operational resilience, with the objective of maintaining BMO’s reputation for preventing avoidable operating failu res and\\nmistakes. As part of its governance responsibilities, the ORC reviews and recommends corporate policies and standards to the Risk Review Committee(RRC), the RMC and senior executives for review and approval as required, as well as the methodologies and tools that comprise the governingprinciples of the Operational Non-Financial Risk Management (ONFRM) framework. The documentation that gives effect to these governing principlesis reviewed on a regular basis in order to confirm that it incorporates sound governance practices and is consistent with BMO’s risk appetite. Regularanalysis and reporting of our enterprise operational risk profile to the various committees (ORC, RMC and RRC) are important elements of our riskgovernance framework. Operational risk reporting provides an integrated view of top and emerging risks, trends in loss data, capital consumption,key risk indicators (KRIs) and operating group profiles. We continue to invest in our reporting platforms, supporting timely and comprehensivereporting capabilities in order to enhance risk transparency and facilitate the proactive management of operational risk exposures.\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Management\\nAs the first line of defence, the operating groups and Corporate Services are accountable for the day-to-day management of non-financial risk,including the Chief Risk Officers of our businesses, who provide governance and oversight for their respective business units, along with CorporateServices, which provides additional governance and oversight in certain targeted areas. Operational Risk Officers independently assess the opera tional\\nrisk profiles of our operating groups, identify material exposures and potential weaknesses in our product, service and process-based risk and cont rol\\nenvironment, and recommend appropriate mitigation strategies and actions.\\nIndependent risk management oversight is provided by ONFRM, which is responsible for developing and implementing effective risk-related\\nstrategies, tools and policies, and for exercising second-line oversight, effective challenge and governance. ONFR sets out and maintains the ONFR M\\nframework, which defines the processes to be used by the first line of defence to identify, assess, manage, monitor, mitigate and report on keyoperational risk exposures, losses and near-miss operational risk events with significant potential impact. In addition, the ONFRM framework sets out\\nthe processes by which ONFRM, as the second line of defence, guides, supports, monitors, assesses and communicates with the first line in itsmanagement of operational non-financial risks.\\n100 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 89', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 11, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667361', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 89\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Implementing the governing principles of the ONFRM framework also involves continuing to strengthen our risk culture and reinforce ethical and\\nresponsible behaviour by setting clear expectations from leadership, promoting greater awareness and understanding of non-financial risk across all\\nthree lines of defence, learning from loss events and near-misses, providing related training and communication, and aiming to ensure effectivepositive reinforcement and consequence management. BMO’s Board of Directors has overall accountability for BMO’s culture. We continue tostrengthen our second-line-of-defence support and oversight capabilities with an enhanced Operational Non-Financial Risk Operating Model, whic h\\ntakes a differentiated approach based on the nature of the underlying risk and existing organizational structures.\\nThrough the implementation and oversight of the ONFRM framework, we seek to maintain an operational risk profile that is consistent with our\\nrisk appetite and supported by adequate capital, and reflects our commitment to an ethical culture defined by BMO’s values, including integrity andresponsible risk management, reinforced by enhanced operational resilience. Operational resilience is an organization’s ability to protect and s ustain\\ncore business products and services that are essential for its clients, both during the normal course of business and when experiencing operationalstress or disruption. It involves the ability to deal with unpredictable events and adapt to changes and external circumstances, and is an outcome ofeffective management of ONFR. Operational resilience is a positive, forward-looking strategic positioning that allows us to take measured risks wi th\\nconfidence and prepare BMO to withstand challenges in the market arising from both expected and unexpected events.\\nIn August 2024, OSFI released Guideline E-21, which sets out revised operational risk management and new operational resilience requirements\\nfor financial institutions. We are further enhancing our program to comply with these requirements by September 2026.\\nThe following are the key programs, methodologies and processes set out in the ONFRM framework that assist us in the ongoing review of our\\noperational non-financial risk profile:\\n‰BMO has transitioned to a new program for the assessment of non-financial risk, known as Product/Service and Process Risk Assessment . This\\nprogram is used by our operating groups and Corporate Services to assess the controls and residual risk exposures in their business operations byfocusing on the key controls applied to their products, services, internal activities and processes. It provides a current and forward-looking view of\\nthe impact of both our internal controls and the external business environment on the risk profiles of our operating groups and Corporate Services,supporting the proactive identification, assessment, management, monitoring and mitigation of risk.\\n‰BMO’s Initiative Assessment and Approval Process is used to assess, document and approve new products and services when a new business,\\nproduct or service is developed, or existing products and services are enhanced, as well as review projects which could impact the existing controlenvironment. This process supports continuous oversight of change in risk exposure by setting out specific requirements for due diligence, approva l,\\nmonitoring and reporting that apply at all levels of the organization.\\n‰Material trends, metrics and risk assessments comprising Key Risk Indicators, Issues Management andInternal Loss Data Events are integral\\ncomponents of an operational risk profile and are utilized to assess specific risk exposures in relation to BMO’s overall risk appetite.\\n‰Historical Internal Loss Data Events are recorded and maintained within the bank’s central operational risk platform. Our policies and standards\\nrequire the timely, concise and accurate reporting of events, including second line effective challenge. Root cause analysis is undertaken onmaterial events and loss data is monitored based on the bank’s risk appetite.\\n‰Operational Risk Capital Measurement : The bank’s operational risk capital is determined using the Basel III Standardized Approach (SA), which is\\na product of the Business Indicator Component (BIC) and Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM). BIC is a financial statement-based proxy representing activ ity\\nwithin the bank and ILM is a proxy representing the control environment relative to activity. ILM is a mathematical calculation based on 10-yearaverage historical losses (net of recoveries) and the three-year average BIC.\\n‰Stress Testing Scenario Analysis assesses the potential impact of severe, hypothetical but plausible scenarios covering material and emerging\\nrisks, as well as critical business processes at the bank. Results of the stress test scenarios are leveraged to derive operational loss projections t hat\\nmay be used for risk management (understanding areas of concentration, susceptibility, prioritizing incremental risk mitigation strategies, etc .) and\\nrisk measurement (understanding exposures, benchmarking, developing KRIs, controls and supporting regulatory stress submissions).\\n‰BMO’s Corporate Risk & Insurance (CR&I) group provides a second layer of mitigation for certain operational risk exposures. CR&I is also\\naccountable for establishing and maintaining the enterprise-wide insurance program. We purchase insurance when required by law, regulation orcontractual agreement, and when it is economically attractive and practicable to mitigate our risks, in order to provide adequate protection agains t\\nunexpected material loss. The policy structures and coverage provisions of our insurance positions are assessed annually to confirm alignment withBMO’s overall risk tolerance.\\n‰BMO is evolving its approach to overseeing payment risk by horizontally assessing both financial and non-financial risks, which can arise at anystage in the end-to-end life cycle of its products and services.\\nThe following are some of the operational non-financial risks that may adversely affect BMO’s business and financial results.\\nAnti-Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Risk\\nMoney laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risks are associated wi th laundering the proceeds of crime, financing terrorist activity or vi olating\\neconomic sanctions by making use of the bank’s products or services. Complia nce with applicable anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing ( AML/\\nATF) and sanctions measures is critical to safeguarding BMO, our custo mers and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to managing\\nAML/ATF and sanctions risks effectively, and to complying with releva nt laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\\nconsequences of non-compliance with these requirements include legal pr oceedings, financial losses, regulatory enforcement actions, sanctions and\\nfines, criminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or a n inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in investor and customer\\nconfidence, and damage to our reputation. Under the direction of the Chie f Anti-Money Laundering Officer (CAMLO), BMO’s enterprise AML/ATF and\\nsanctions compliance program promotes effective governance and oversi ght across all of our businesses, and sets out policies, risk assessments, du e\\ndiligence processes and controls and training, including targeted train ing and mandatory annual training for all employees. BMO’s compliance prog ram\\napplies data analytics, technology and professional expertise in order to deter, detect and report suspicious activity. BMO has implemented a\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 101\\n\\n\\n## Page 90\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nKnow-Your-Customer program which aims to understand who its customers ar e, as well as the beneficial ownership of entities holding BMO products. In\\naddition, customers and transactions are routinely screened against curre nt sanctions, terrorist and other designated watch lists. The CAMLO repo rts\\nregularly to the Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Boar d of Directors and to senior management on the effectiveness of the\\ncompliance program. The effectiveness of our AML/ATF and sanctions comp liance program is subject to regular review and independent assessment by\\nthe Corporate Audit Division. We remain committed to effective com pliance and the ongoing effort to protect the financial system.\\nArtificial Intelligence Risk\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) risk arises from the development, implementation and incorrect or biased use of AI systems, including machine learnin g\\n(ML) and generative AI system outputs, which may lead to financial loss, poor customer experiences and damage to our reputation.\\nThe AI capabilities available to the industry have been evolving at unprecedented speed, highlighting new opportunities for innovation across a\\nbroad range of products and services. AI is expected to become a key driver of future operating efficiencies, but only if we adopt and integrate newtechnologies in a safe and responsible manner. Our use of AI has the potential to pose risks to the organization that overlap existing riskmanagement frameworks (e.g., model risk). These AI risks may be exacerbated by the scale, scope and processing speed of AI, or can take novelforms. In addition, the use of AI outside of BMO can complicate the threat landscape and could impact other risk frameworks which are evolving tomeet these more complex threats.\\nOur management and oversight of AI risk, including risks arising from the use of generative AI, are consistent with our ERMF, employ our three-\\nlines-of-defence model and consider industry standard frameworks and existing regulatory requirements such as privacy laws. Significant AIinitiatives are reviewed by a cross-functional group before implementation, which considers potential risks and adverse impacts, including unfai ro r\\nbiased output from AI systems, and measures to mitigate such risks. We are focused on advancing our commitment to serving our customers in a waythat fosters confidence and trust in our fair, secure, transparent and ethical use of these technologies, utilizing our risk management practices, o ur\\nglobal privacy principles and our internal safeguards, such as oversight, monitoring and testing, to employ AI responsibly. Our approach to theresponsible use of AI, including generative AI, continues to evolve and adapt to ongoing regulatory developments in the jurisdictions in which weoperate.\\nBusiness Continuity Risk\\nBusiness continuity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to maintain, continue or restore essential business operations during and /\\nor after an event that prevents BMO from conducting business in the normal course.\\nBusiness continuity management should enable BMO to recover, maintain and manage critical processes, as well as safeguard the interests and\\nwell-being of our customers, shareholders and employees. In the event of an operational disruption, effective business continuity plans aim tominimize adverse impacts on our customers, employees and other interested parties. These operational disruptions could result from severe weather ,\\ntechnology failures, cyber attacks or any other event that can lead to process failure. We have a framework in place that facilitates the rapid recover y\\nand timely resumption of critical operations, including availability of our people, processes, facilities and technology, and maintenance of our t hird-\\nparty relationships. Our comprehensive business continuity management strategy involves developing, testing and maintaining recovery strategi es\\nand plans with the objective that critical processes and third-party relationships remain resilient throughout any disruption.\\nCyber and Information Security Risk\\nCyber and information security risk arises from the possibility that BMO’s business could be materially affected by security incidents, including t he\\nloss, theft or misuse of information, including all types of data (e.g., client data, employee data and the organization’s proprietary data), as well as\\nany potential failure to comply with rules concerning information or cyber security. We are the target of attempted cyber attacks and mustcontinuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure, as well as access to and th e\\nsecurity of our data. Any resulting data breaches may lead to exposure or loss of data, including customer or employee information and the bank’sstrategic or other sensitive internal information, and could result in identity theft, fraud or business losses. Cyber attacks could result in syste m\\nfailures and disruption of services, and expose the bank to litigation and regulatory risk, as well as reputational harm. Threat campaigns are becomi ng\\nmore sophisticated and well-organized, and often take place through third-party suppliers, which can negatively impact our business, brand andreputation, as well as customer retention and acquisition. Due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective serviceproviders), central agents, exchanges, clearing-houses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of these are subjec tt oa\\nsuccessful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the thirdparty or result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client, employee or other confidential information, which could interrupt our business an d\\nadversely affect our operations and reputation.\\nCyber and information security is critical to the delivery of the bank’s strategies, initiatives and goals. As technology evolves rapidly and the\\nconnective capabilities of digital devices continue to grow, cyber threats and risks also evolve. These threats include breaches of, or disruptions to,\\nour systems or operations, as well as unauthorized access to, or use or dissemination of, information pertaining to BMO, our customers or employees.At BMO, our response includes investing in our Financial Crimes Unit and technological infrastructure, equipping our team to detect and address cybe r\\nsecurity threats across North America, Europe and Asia. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not beable to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, as the techniques used are increasingly sophistic ated,\\nchange frequently and are often not recognized until launched. As a result of these risks, we could become subject to legal or regulatory action,reputational and operational harm, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against, or not fully covered through any insurancemaintained by BMO.\\n102 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 91\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Data and Analytics Risk\\nData and analytics risk arises from the possibility of loss or harm from the inadequate or failed identification, management, accuracy or timeliness of\\nstructured or unstructured data used to support business processes and decision-making, including analytics. Data quality, governance andarchitecture impact our understanding and management of BMO’s data assets and the data quality of analytical output.\\nWe continue to invest in new capabilities in support of BMO’s digital transformation. Our ability to effectively manage and safeguard critical data\\nhas a direct impact on our successful deployment of digital processes and our ability to develop and introduce innovative new capabilities with toolsand systems driven by AI. Our management of data and analytics risk is focused on the quality, resilience, retention and governance of BMO’s dataassets, which are foundational to our business operations, strategy and future growth, including BMO’s Digital First strategy.\\nFraud and Physical Security Risk\\nFraud risk arises from the possibility that an intentional act, misstatement or omission designed to deceive others may result in the intended targetexperiencing a loss or the perpetrator achieving a gain. Fraud may be perpetrated by our employees, suppliers or other external parties, includingBMO customers. Fraudsters continue to target the financial industry with increasingly sophisticated methods that facilitate fraud and remit funds to\\nfraudulent accounts. BMO maintains a Fraud Risk Management program intended to proactively manage fraud risks across the bank.\\nThe management of physical security risk seeks to ensure that the bank, its customers, employees and third parties are protected against the risk\\nof loss, interference, unauthorized physical access, damage or injury to which they may be exposed as a result of the bank’s operations. Physicalsecurity risks may emerge through various threat vectors, including criminal activities, terrorist attacks, sociopolitical unrest, human error, natural\\ndisasters and/or geopolitical threats. Physical security measures may also support the management of other risks, including risks related toinformation security, privacy and fraud.\\nProject and Change Management Risk\\nProject and change management risk is the risk of loss arising from the possibility that BMO could experience a loss due to substandard delivery of aninitiative that may result in the business not achieving its intended outcome, as well as attracting additional regulatory scrutiny.\\nThe bank has established a Project and Change Management Risk Framework to drive consistency in the delivery of an initiative within a\\nprescribed control environment. This framework outlines the principles and processes for providing governance, monitoring and reporting, as well as\\nthe roles and responsibilities necessary to address project and change management risk across the enterprise in order to meet or exceed theexpectations of interested parties.\\nTechnology Risk\\nTechnology risk, including risks related to emerging technology and digital platforms, is the possibility that the inadequacy, misuse, disruption or\\nfailure of information technology systems, infrastructure or data could result in an inability to meet business needs. Technology risk managementmeasures are intended to protect BMO’s systems, data and assets, and help safeguard their confidentiality, integrity and availability. As the adopt ion\\nof digital banking channels continues to grow, we continue to invest in new and innovative technological capabilities in order to meet our customers’expectations and keep their data secure. In alignment with our operational risk management framework, we follow a program that addressesexposures to technology risk, supported by a team of technology risk management experts.\\nThird-Party Risk\\nThird-party risk is the risk of loss associated with an entity failing to provide goods, business activities, functions and/or services, failing to p rotect\\ndata or systems of the bank, or exposing BMO to other negative outcomes. BMO’s third-party risk management (TPRM) framework sets therequirements for the identification, assessment, management, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of third-party risk across the third-party li fe cycle.\\nThis framework is supported by a centrally maintained TPRM program.\\nWe continue to enhance and evolve our capabilities in order to maintain robust risk management practices, support operational resilience\\nobjectives and comply with regulatory requirements.\\nFor further discussion of third-party risk, refer to the Cyber and Information Security section.\\nModel Risk\\nModel Risk is the potential for adverse outcomes resulting from decisions that are based on incorrect or misused model results. These adverse\\noutcomes can include financial loss, poor business decision-making and damage to reputation.\\nModel risk arises from the use of quantitative analytical tools that apply statistical, mathematical, economic, algorithmic or other advanced\\ntechniques, such as AI and ML, to process input data and generate quantitative output or estimates. These analytical tools range from very simplequantitative methods that produce straightforward estimates to highly sophisticated models that can be used to value complex transactions orprovide a broad range of forward-looking estimates. These analytical tools generate results that can inform business, risk and capital managementdecision-making, and assist in making daily lending, trading, underwriting, funding, investment and operational decisions.\\nThese analytical tools provide important insights and are effective when used within a framework that identifies key assumptions and\\nlimitations, while controlling and mitigating model risk. In addition to applying judgment to evaluate the reliability of model results, we mitigat e\\nmodel risk by maintaining strong controls over the development, validation, implementation and use of all models across the enterprise. We alsoseek to ensure that other analytical tools, including critical calculations and other estimation approaches, such as model overlays used for keybusiness decision-making, are intuitive, experience-based, well-documented and subject to effective challenge by employees, who have sufficien t\\nexpertise and knowledge in order to deliver reasonable results.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 103\\n\\n\\n## Page 92\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nModel Risk Management Framework\\nRisk is inherent in models because model results are estimates that rely on statistical, mathematical or other quantitative techniques to approxima te\\nreality and transform data into estimates or forecasts of future outcomes. Model risk also arises from the potential misuse of models or model results .\\nModel risk is governed at BMO by a risk-based enterprise-wide Model Risk Management Framework.\\nInitiation &\\nIdentification123 67 4Model Life Cycle\\nDevelopment Validation ImplementationUse &\\nMaintenanceOngoing\\nMonitoring\\n& ValidationDecommission5\\nThe Model Risk Management Framework sets out an end-to-end approach for model risk governance across the model life cycle and for the\\nmanagement of model risk within the limits of our risk appetite. The framework includes BMO’s Model Risk Corporate Policy, Model Risk Guidelinesand supporting operating procedures, which outline the governing principles for managing model risk, describe model risk management processes indetail and define the roles and responsibilities of interested parties across the model life cycle. Model owners, developers and users serve as the fi rst\\nline of defence, while the Model Risk Management group is the second line of defence and the Corporate Audit Division is the third line of defence.\\nOur Model Risk Management group is responsible for developing and maintaining our Model Risk Management Framework in alignment with\\nregulatory expectations, as well as for exercising oversight of the effectiveness of model processes, model inventory and the overall aggregation,assessment and reporting of model risk. This framework incorporates guidance on the management of risks, the safe and responsible adoption ofadvances in automation used for decision-making, such as large language models and algorithmic trading, as well as other AI and ML applications. Ourenterprise Model Risk Management Committee (MRMC), a sub-committee of the RMC, is a cross-functional group representing interested parties acrossthe enterprise. The MRMC meets regularly to help direct BMO’s use of models, oversee the development, implementation and maintenance of theModel Risk Management Framework, provide effective challenge and discuss governance of the enterprise’s models.\\nOutcomes Analysis and Back-TestingOnce models are validated, approved and in use, they are subject to ongoing monitoring, including outcomes analysis, at varying frequencies. As akey component of outcomes analysis, back-testing compares model results against actual observed outcomes. Variances between model forecastsand actual observed outcomes are measured against defined risk materiality thresholds and tolerance ranges, which may result in further steps beingtaken, such as model review and parameter recalibration, as appropriate. This analysis serves to confirm the validity of a model’s performance overtime. Controls are in place to address identified issues and enhance our models’ overall performance.\\nAll models used within BMO, including models that incorporate AI and ML techniques, are subject to validation and ongoing monitoring to\\nconfirm that they are being used in alignment with our framework and in compliance with regulatory expectations, such as those related to ethics,privacy, fairness and explainability. This framework applies to a wide variety of models, ranging from market, credit and non-financial risk models to\\nstress testing, pricing and valuation, and anti-money laundering models.\\nCautionThis Operational Non-Financial Risk section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Stateme nts.\\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\\nLegal and Regulatory Risk is the potential for loss or harm resulting from failure to comply with laws or satisfy contractual obligations or\\nregulatory requirements. This includes the risk arising from any failure to: comply with the law (in letter or in spirit) or maintain standards of care ;\\nimplement legal or regulatory requirements; enforce or comply with contractual terms; assert non-contractual rights; effectively manage dispute s;\\nor act in a manner so as to maintain our reputation.\\nThe success of BMO’s business operations relies in part on our ability to manage our exposure to legal and regulatory risk. The financial services\\nindustry is highly regulated and subject to strict enforcement of legal and regulatory requirements. Banks globally continue to be subject to fines a nd\\nother penalties for a number of regulatory and conduct issues. We are exposed to risks in connection with regulatory and governmental inquiries,investigations and enforcement actions, as well as criminal prosecutions. As rulemaking and supervisory expectations continue to evolve, we monit or\\ndevelopments to enable BMO to respond by implementing changes as required.\\nUnder the direction of BMO’s General Counsel, our Legal & Regulatory Compliance group maintains enterprise-wide frameworks that set out the\\nsteps to be taken to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on exposure to legal and regulatory risk. We identify applicable laws andregulations and potential risks, recommend mitigation measures and strategies, conduct internal investigations, and oversee legal proceedings a nd\\nenforcement actions, including civil claims and litigation, criminal charges, and regulatory examinations and audits.\\nHeightened regulatory and supervisory scrutiny has a significant impact on the way we conduct business. Working with the operating groups and\\nCorporate Services, Legal & Regulatory Compliance assesses and analyzes the implications of changes in regulatory and supervisory expectations. W e\\ndevote substantial resources to the implementation of systems and processes required to comply with new regulations. Failure to comply withapplicable legal and regulatory requirements may lead to legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions or fines, enforcement actions ,\\ncriminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in investor and cus tomer\\nconfidence, and damage to our reputation. Certain businesses are also subject to fiduciary requirements, including policies and practices that add ress\\nthe responsibilities of a business to a customer, such as service requirements and expectations, customer suitability determinations, disclosureobligations and communications.\\n104 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 93\\n\\n                          MD&A                          BMO is subject to legal proceedings, including investigations by regulators, arising in the ordinary course of business, and the unfavourable\\nresolution of any such legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow s,\\ncapital position or credit ratings; require material changes in our operations; result in operational restrictions or an inability to execute certa in business\\nstrategies; result in loss of customers; and damage our reputation. The volume of legal proceedings and the amount of damages and penaltiesassessed in such legal proceedings could grow in the future. Information regarding material legal proceedings to which we are a party is included inthe Legal Proceedings section in Note 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intend ed\\nto provide reasonable assurance that relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, so that appropriatedecisions can be made regarding public disclosure. In assessing the materiality of legal proceedings, factors considered include a case-by-caseassessment of specific facts and circumstances, our past experience and the opinions of legal experts. However, some legal proceedings may behighly complex, and may include novel or untested legal claims or theories. The outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to anticipate until latein the proceedings, which may last several years.\\nBMO’s Anti-Corruption Office, through its global program, has articulated key principles and procedures that support the effective oversight of\\ncompliance with anti-corruption legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These include guidance on identifying, avoiding and reporti ng on\\ncorrupt practices and rigorously investigating allegations of corrupt activity. Evolving competition or antitrust risk is managed globally throu gh BMO’s\\nCompetition/Antitrust Office, which is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of a compliance program that supports theoversight of competition/antitrust laws or regulatory expectations.\\nGovernments and regulators around the world continue to focus on anti-mon ey laundering and related concerns, raising their expectations for the\\nquality and efficacy of anti-money laundering programs and penalizing i nstitutions that fail to meet these expectations. Failure to meet these\\nexpectations may lead to legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions or fines, enforcement actions, criminal convictions and penal ties,\\noperational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business stra tegies, a decline in investor and customer confidence, and damage to our\\nreputation. Under the direction of the Chief Anti-Money Laundering Offi cer (CAMLO), BMO’s Anti-Money Laundering Office is responsible for the\\nassessment, governance and oversight of the principles and procedures th at support the effective oversight of compliance with laws and regulations\\nand internal risk parameters related to anti-money laundering, anti-terr orist financing and sanctions measures. For further discussion, refer to the\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Management – Anti-Money Lau ndering, Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Risk section.\\nBMO has built its reputation on a strong foundation of ethical business practices, a client service culture and our track record of responsible risk\\nmanagement. We have adopted a wide range of practices, in addition to BMO’s Code of Conduct, to support the ethical conduct of our employees andBoard of Directors and mitigate the risk of potential misconduct. Misconduct is behaviour that falls short of legal, professional, internal conduct and\\nethical standards. Acting with integrity and competing ethically and responsibly support our focus on maintaining a strong risk culture. For furthe r\\ndiscussion, refer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework – Risk Culture section.\\nAll of these frameworks reflect the three-lines-of-defence operating model described previously. The operating groups and Corporate Services\\nmanage day-to-day risks by implementing and monitoring corporate policies and standards, while Legal & Regulatory Compliance units specificallyassigned to each of the operating groups provide advice and independent legal and regulatory risk management oversight.\\nThe General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer regularly report to the Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Board of\\nDirectors and senior management on the effectiveness of our enterprise compliance program. The program takes a risk-based approach to identify,assess and manage any risks related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and directs operating groups and Corporate Services tomaintain policies, procedures and controls that address these laws and regulations. Under the direction of the Chief Compliance Officer, we identif y\\nand report on gaps and deficiencies, and we track remedial action plans. The CAMLO also regularly reports to the ACRC.\\nAll BMO employees must regularly complete legal and regulatory training on topics such as anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, competition/\\nantitrust and privacy policies, standards and directives. This is carried out in conjunction with our Code of Conduct training, which tests employee s’\\nknowledge and understanding of the behaviour required of BMO employees.\\nWe continue to respond to other global regulatory developments, including the impact of changes in capital and liquidity requirements. These\\ndevelopments include sustainability and climate change related developments, consumer protection measures and specific financial reforms andprivacy matters, which are discussed further below. For additional discussion of regulatory developments related to capital management and liquid ity\\nand funding risk, refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section and the Liquidity and Funding Risk section. For a discussion of the impact o f\\ncertain other regulatory developments, refer to: Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments – Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets; Risks That MayAffect Future Results – Fiscal and Monetary Policies and Other Economic Conditions in the Countries in which BMO Conducts Business; Tax Legislationand Interpretations; and Other Regulatory Developments.\\nSustainability and Climate Change Matters\\nWe continue to monitor the rulemaking activities of regulatory authorities, and we are participating in programs and consultations that focus on ris k\\nmanagement and disclosures related to sustainability matters, as well as trends in climate-related litigation. Globally, we are also tracking theemergence and finalization of formal supervisory regulatory frameworks governing the analysis and reporting of risks related to sustainability an d\\nclimate change, including frameworks in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. In addition, current and emergingregulatory requirements in certain U.S. states may apply restrictions or sanctions on financial institutions that impose any environmental standa rds\\nthat exceed the legal or regulatory requirements of the states in which they operate.

In Canada, there is continuing focus on requiring financial institutions to support mortgage holders at risk, asoutlined in the federal government’s Canadian Mortgage Charter. In addition, the government is taking steps to reduce the costs of banking, includin g\\nby lowering banking fees, through a cap on non-sufficient funds fees, which will reduce our fee revenue when implemented. Several provinces arealso enhancing protections for consumers, including such areas as consumer fraud, through legislative changes to their consumer protection regime s.\\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators adopted changes to harmonize and enhance reporting of theongoing costs, including embedded fees, of owning investment funds and segregated funds. In the United States, banking regulators have aheightened focus on matters pertaining to racial equity, financial inclusion and consumer protection, including the impact on consumers from fraud or\\nprocesses to protect consumers from fraud. Key consumer concerns, including fair lending and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, are nowsubject to heightened regulatory scrutiny in bank examination programs. In both Canada and the United States, there is a growing focus on consumerdata rights and both jurisdictions have started to introduce regulatory frameworks for open banking that will require banks to share data, aspermitted by consumers, with authorized third parties.\\nPrivacy\\nProtection of personal information is critical to maintaining the trust of our customers. Our handling of personal information is increasingly impo rtant\\nas we continue to drive our Digital First strategy. There is a growing focus on regulation related to privacy and the use and safeguarding of personalinformation, and we continue to advance our privacy program to comply with new and amended legislation where we do business. In Canada,significant reform to federal privacy laws is expected under Bill C-27, including new regulatory powers and penalties and additional legislation toaddress the use of artificial intelligence. In Quebec, Law 25 (previously Bill 64) came into effect in three phases, beginning in fiscal 2021 and endin g\\nin September 2024. Law 25 modernizes the province’s private-sector privacy regime, introduces new regulations related to biometrics and automateddecisions, and gives new powers to regulators to impose monetary administrative penalties. Outside of Canada, large fines and settlements havebeen imposed for breaches of privacy rights and failure to comply with regulatory privacy requirements – evidence of heightened regulatory vigilanc e\\nand enforcement. The California Consumer Privacy Act was enhanced and amended in 2023 by the California Privacy Rights Act , which includes new\\nand expanded privacy rights for California residents. Other states have introduced privacy legislation, which is leading to a growing patchwork ofprivacy laws in the United States. In the European Union and the United Kingdom, there are ongoing concerns regarding the transfer of personal datato countries lacking adequate privacy protection. Privacy-related risks, including risks of privacy breaches, have escalated as a result of the thr eat\\nlandscape. For further discussion, refer to the Top and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results – Cyber and Information Security Risk section an d\\nthe Operational Non-Financial Risk – Cyber and Information Security Risk section.\\nU.S. Regulatory Developments\\nThere are several pending regulatory rules that will likely impact BMO’s U.S. operations, including the following:\\n‰Capital: In July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued new rule proposals that would revise the regulatory capital framework for large bank holdingcompanies and their depository institutions, including BMO Financial Corp. (BFC), BMO’s U.S. holding company, and BMO Bank N.A. These proposalswould implement the risk-based capital standards contained in the Basel III Reforms (referred to as Basel III Endgame) published by the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision. On September 10, 2024, the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the proposed rules will be revised andre-issued as a new proposal.\\n‰Long-term debt: In August 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a new rule proposal that would require large banks with total assetsof $100 billion or more to maintain a layer of long-term debt, which would improve financial stability by increasing the resolvability and resilienceof such institutions.\\nThe impact of these proposed rules on our results will depend on the final rules issued by the U.S. banking agencies. We currently do not expect a\\nmaterial change to our enterprise-level funding activities if these rules are enacted as proposed.\\nBFC is regulated as a Category III firm under the Enhanced Prudential Standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Additional information\\nregarding regulatory requirements that apply to BFC is set out in the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section.\\nCautionThis Legal and Regulatory Risk section contains forward-looking statements.

The impact of this risk can be limited through an effective strategic risk management framework and stress testing.\\nBMO’s Corporate Strategy group oversees the strategic planning process and works with the lines of business and Corporate Services to identify,\\nmonitor and mitigate risks across the enterprise. Our rigorous strategic risk management framework encourages a consistent approach in thedevelopment of strategic plans through an integrated, multi-year strategic and financial planning process, in alignment with our enterprise riskappetite.\\nThe framework promotes consistency and adherence to management standards, including a consideration of the results of stress testing as an\\ninput into our decision-making. The potential impacts of changes in the business environment, including macroeconomic developments, broadindustry trends, the actions of existing and new competitors and regulatory developments, are considered in this process and inform decision-makin g\\nwithin each line of business. Oversight of strategic risk is the responsibility of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. This is carried out\\nthrough an annual review of enterprise and operating group strategies, which involves interactive sessions that challenge assumptions and thestrategies in the context of both the current and potential future business environment. Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management reviews businessstrategies to confirm that they are developed and executed in accordance with the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework and are within ourestablished risk appetite, tolerances and limits. Where required, these strategies are revised to address new or unexpected developments.\\nStrategic risk also includes business risk arising from specific enterprise activities and the effects these could have on earnings. Within BMO, eac h\\noperating group is responsible for controlling its respective business risk by assessing, managing and mitigating risks. To manage exposure totransverse business risks (i.e., those spanning multiple lines of business, such as climate change), the Corporate Strategy group works in tandem wi th\\nthe relevant business partners to shape effective mitigation approaches.\\nOur ability to implement the strategic plans developed by management influences our financial performance. Performance objectives are\\nestablished through the strategic planning process and our progress toward those objectives is monitored regularly and reported on quarterly, usin g\\nboth leading and lagging indicators of absolute and relative performance, so that strategies can be reviewed and adjusted where necessary. Regularstrategic and financial updates are also reviewed closely in order to identify any significant emerging risk issues.\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk is the potential for loss or harm directly or indirectly resulting from environmental and social factors that impact\\nBMO or its customers, and BMO’s impact on the environment and society.\\nIn recognition of its unique characteristics, environmental and social (E&S) risk is classified in BMO’s Risk Taxonomy as a transverse risk that may\\nmanifest itself through other risk types, namely credit and counterparty risk, market risk, insurance risk, liquidity and funding risk, operationa l\\nnon-financial risk, legal and regulatory risk, strategic risk and reputation risk. E&S risk may arise over a range of time frames, from short-term tolong-term. Factors that may give rise to E&S risk include, but are not limited to: climate change; pollution and waste; the use of energy, water andother resources; biodiversity and land use; human rights; diversity, equity and inclusion; labour standards; community health, safety and securit y; land\\nacquisition and involuntary resettlement; Indigenous peoples’ rights; and cultural heritage. We are advancing our risk identification efforts by defining\\nthese factors and identifying any risk exposures that may be affected by the transverse impact of these factors.\\nWe recognize that climate change involves exposure to physical and transition risks. Physical risks are associated with a changing climate, which\\ncan have both acute and chronic physical effects. These risks may include an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather-related events, suchas storms, floods, wildfires and heatwaves, or longer-term changes, such as temperature changes, rising sea levels and changes in soil productivity .\\nTo date, key climate change indicators, weather-related events and associated scientific research indicate that global exposure to climate change risks\\nappears to be accelerating. Transition risks are associated with the shift to a net zero carbon economy. These risks may arise from climate-relatedpolicy changes, technological changes and behavioural changes involving carbon-pricing mechanisms, or a shift in consumer preferences towardlower-carbon products and services. We continue to closely monitor these changes, some of which may unfold more rapidly than others asconsumers, clients, investors, governments and communities act to enhance their resilience to climate-related risks.\\nWe may have direct exposure to E&S risk associated with the ownership and operation of BMO’s businesses. We may be indirectly exposed to the\\nrisk of financial loss or reputational harm if our customers or suppliers are affected by E&S factors or are associated with adverse environmental orsocial impacts to such an extent that they are unable to meet their financial or other obligations to us, or cause reputational risks for BMO. E&S factor s\\nmay also give rise to the risk of reputational harm if we are perceived to not respond effectively to those factors, or to cause, contribute or be linkedto adverse impacts on the environment or society, as discussed in the Reputation Risk section.\\nGovernance\\nThe Board of Directors, through the Risk Review Committee (RRC), approves the E&S Risk Appetite Statement and the E&S Risk Corporate Policy, asdiscussed below. The RRC assists the Board of Directors in meeting its oversight responsibilities for the identification, assessment and managemen to f\\nour exposure to E&S risk, including risks arising from climate change, for the overall adherence to risk management corporate policies, and forcomplying with risk-related regulatory requirements. The Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) assesses the effectiveness of BMO’sgovernance of sustainability matters and approves BMO’s sustainability reporting and disclosures, including our Sustainability Report and Publi c\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 107\\n\\n\\n## Page 96\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAccountability Statement, and our Climate Report. The Human Resources Committee has responsibility for the alignment of executive compensation\\nwith performance, including performance in relation to BMO’s environmental and social objectives. The Governance and Nominating Committeeregularly reviews the charters of our Board of Directors and its committees to assess the coverage and alignment of their responsibilities foroverseeing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues with their respective mandates.\\nBMO’s General Counsel is the bank’s Executive Committee Sponsor for Sustainability and Climate, and has accountability for legal and regulatory\\nrisk, reputation risk, business conduct and ethics, and sustainability, including climate change. Our ESG Executive Committee comprises executiv e\\ncommittee members from the lines of business and Corporate Services, and provides oversight and leadership for our sustainability strategy,including our Climate Ambition. In addition to the ESG Executive Committee, BMO has a Sustainability Council which acts as a leadership forum foradvancing sustainability initiatives. Senior management oversees E&S risk through management committees and forums that provide oversight andreceive updates on sustainability matters and E&S risk. These include, but are not limited to: Disclosure Committee, Risk Management Committee(RMC), Reputation Risk Management Committee (RRMC), Enterprise Regulatory Committee, Climate Commercialization Working Group and ImpactInvestment Fund Committee, as well as the Investment Committee of BMO Global Asset Management. Additional committees, forums and workinggroups may be established as needed. In addition, the Board of Directors and any management committees active in other jurisdictions receiveupdates and oversee E&S risk for the relevant jurisdiction. They also receive updates on sustainability matters and E&S risk across the enterprise.\\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO), as Head of Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM), and supported by the Risk Executive Committee, acts\\nas the second line of defence on the transverse impacts of E&S risk on credit and counterparty risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, insurancerisk and operational non-financial risk; oversees risk appetite for E&S risk in the context of these risks; and reports to the Board of Directors, its R RC\\nand the RMC on E&S risk.\\nStrategy\\nOur climate ambition is to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world. This ambition is explicitly linked to our enterprisecommercial strategy, and we are working to realize this ambition through a four-pillar climate strategy: Commitment; Capabilities; Client partner ship\\nand commercialization; and Convening for climate action. Our strategy seeks to capture commercialization opportunities by working with our client s\\non their decarbonization journeys. The strategy is being implemented by our operating groups, overseen by the ESG Executive Committee andsupported by the BMO Climate Institute, which serves as an enterprise resource to accelerate BMO’s climate-related transition efforts and as aninternal and external convenor on climate action.\\nIn order to remain informed about emerging E&S risks, we participate in global forums with other financial institutions and maintain an open\\ndialogue with other external parties.\\nE&S Risk Management\\nA successful future for BMO and our customers depends on the sustainability of the environment, communities and economies in which we operate.We seek to understand the impact that E&S risk factors could have on our business environment, as well as on our clients, portfolios and operations.With this understanding, we are better positioned to make informed strategic decisions.\\nOur E&S Risk Corporate Policy, applicable to all BMO employees, sets out our approach to integrating E&S risk into the Enterprise-Wide Risk\\nManagement Framework (ERMF). The policy affirms the expectation of our Board of Directors that BMO will integrate considerations of E&S risk acrossthe ERMF, including risks arising from climate change. It is supported by BMO’s three-lines-of-defence operating model and is underpinned by our ris k\\nculture. Its implementation involves building new capabilities, while also leveraging our existing risk governance provisions and resources, to i dentify,\\nassess, manage, monitor and report on potential impacts on our clients, portfolios and operations. The E&S Risk Corporate Policy is complemented bytwo enterprise-wide policy documents: a Climate Risk Corporate Standard to enable effective climate risk management and support legal andregulatory compliance, and an E&S Risk Management Framework Directive, which supports implementation of the corporate policy.\\nWe have developed a qualitative Risk Appetite Statement that includes E&S risks, including risks related to climate change. In addition, we have\\nenhanced a transition key risk metric with risk tolerance thresholds, which measures our credit risk exposure in support of carbon-related assets as a\\npercentage of our total credit risk exposure. In parallel, we have also included a key risk indicator to quantify BMO’s exposure to physical risks offlooding, and will continue to expand and enhance these key risk metrics and indicators as appropriate to monitor climate risk concentrations.\\nE&S risk is also addressed in our Credit Risk Management Framework, including provisions for governance and accountabilities, enhanced due\\ndiligence and thresholds for escalations or exceptions. Sector-specific financing guidelines help us identify and manage exposure to E&S risk in hi gher-\\nrisk sectors and integrate consideration of these risks into our decision-making, which also considers factors such as climate change and Indigenou s\\nconsultation. The E&S Risk General Financing Guideline is an enterprise-level second-line directive that applies to wholesale lending transactio ns;\\narticulates our lending risk appetite for E&S risk, outlines the enhanced due diligence process, supported by E&S Risk Rating (ESRR) assessment tool s\\ndeveloped to address sectors with heightened risk and outlines lending considerations, escalations and elevations. The E&S Risk General FinancingGuideline includes direction on developing an understanding of the specific impacts of climate change on borrowers and their operations, includingregulatory and/or legislative changes.\\nWe maintain a diversified lending portfolio to limit our exposure to any one sector or geographic region that might be vulnerable to climate-\\nrelated risk, and we continue to conduct sector-specific reviews across our lending portfolio to assess exposure to climate-sensitive industries. Social\\nand environmental requirements in financing arrangements and transactions are monitored by the lines of business as part of our overall monitoringprocess. Transactions involving significant environmental or social concerns may be escalated to the RRMC for consideration.\\nWe are continuing to develop our climate scenario analysis program to explore climate-specific vulnerabilities and enhance our resilience to\\nclimate-related risks, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The climate scenario an alysis\\nprogram leverages existing risk capabilities in combination with climate-specific expertise, tools and data. This program includes the evaluatio no f\\ntransition risks and physical risks through comprehensive climate-based scenarios across portfolios and risk types, and also considers integrati on of\\nscenario impacts at the enterprise level. This capability enables the bank to execute on regulatory scenario analysis, such as the Standardized Clim ate\\n108 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 97\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Scenario Exercise from OSFI. These analyses help to identify potential exposures and concentrations to short-, medium- and long-term climate risks\\nand may inform our business strategy in relation to climate change going forward. For example, we have identified the channels through whichclimate risk manifests itself in credit, market, operational, liquidity and insurance risk. In addition, we have developed an integrated loss asses sment\\napproach for incorporating climate risk within the bank’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\\nWe continue to assess the credibility, reliability, comparability and decision-making usefulness of various measurement, assessment and\\nreporting approaches, as well as the ways in which we could incorporate them into our climate risk management program and associated disclosures.\\nManaging E&S Risk in the Supply Chain\\nOur Sustainability group partners with the Procurement and Corporate Real Estate groups on operational sustainability. Together, these groups areresponsible for establishing and maintaining an operational environmental management approach, including the application of the framework set ou t\\nin ISO 14001 across our essential facilities, and for setting objectives and targets that are intended to align our operations with our sustainabilit y\\nperformance goals.\\nBMO’s Code of Conduct has been approved by our Board of Directors, and reflects our commitment to manage our business responsibly. We\\nreport publicly under the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 2015 , the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 and Canada’s Fighting Against Forced\\nLabour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act , and we have in place a Supplier Code of Conduct which outlines our standards for integrity, fair dealing\\nand sustainability. We require our suppliers to be aware of, understand and comply with the principles of our Supplier Code of Conduct.\\nBMO’s disclosures will be updated to meet any evolution in the expectations of pertinent legislation, in accordance with applicable timelines.\\nRegulatory Developments\\nE&S-related regulations, frameworks and guidance are rapidly evolving and we continue to monitor such developments, updating our riskmanagement practices and disclosures as necessary.\\nIn March 2024, OSFI released updates to Guideline B-15, Climate Risk Management to align with the International Sustainability Standards\\nBoard’s final IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures , standard. We incorporated these updates into our implementation plans for the first set of\\ndisclosures, effective the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after the fiscal year-end, as well a s\\nthe second phase of disclosure requirements that will be effective the fiscal year ending October 31, 2025.\\nWe are also assessing the impact of the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires disclosure across\\nvarious sustainability topics, as detailed in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards.\\nMetrics and Targets\\nOur reporting on climate-related metrics and targets includes a discussion of BMO’s Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, calculated usingthe GHG Protocol, and a discussion of our Scope 3 emissions, calculated using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). More detaileddiscussion, as well as a discussion of financed emissions targets for certain sectors, can be found in the Climate Report. The BMO Sustainability Repo rt\\nand Climate Report contain metrics, including the tracking of sustainable finance, which are relevant for sustainability purposes but may not bedirectly related to net zero goals or emissions reductions outcomes. The shareholders’ auditors provide a limited assurance report on selectedenvironmental and social indicators in the Sustainability Report and Climate Report.\\nCautionThis Environmental and Social Risk section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statement s.\\nReputation Risk\\nReputation Risk is the potential for loss or harm to the BMO brand. It can arise even if other risks are managed effectively.\\nOur reputation is built on our commitment to high standards of business conduct and is one of our most valuable assets. By protecting and\\nmaintaining our reputation, we safeguard our brand, increase shareholder value, reduce our cost of capital, improve employee engagement andpreserve our customers’ loyalty and trust.\\nWe manage risks to our reputation by considering the potential reputational impact of all business activities, including strategy development and\\nimplementation, transactions and initiatives, data and technology use (including artificial intelligence), product and service offerings, and e vents or\\nincidents impacting BMO, as well as day-to-day decision-making and conduct. We consider our reputation in everything that we do.\\nBMO’s Code of Conduct is the foundation of our ethical culture, and it provides employees with guidance on the behaviour that is expected of\\nthem, so that they can make the right choice when making a decision. Ongoing reinforcement of the commitments set out in the Code of Conductminimizes risks to our reputation that may result from inappropriate behaviour or poor decision-making. Recognizing that non-financial risks can h ave\\na negative impact as significant as the effect of financial risks, we actively promote a culture in which employees are encouraged to raise concernsand are supported in doing so, with zero tolerance for retaliation.\\nIn our corporate governance practices and Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework, we have specific controls in place to manage risks to\\nour reputation. We seek to identify activities or events that could impact our reputation with customers, regulators or other interested parties. Wh ere\\nwe identify a potential risk to our reputation, we take steps to assess and manage that risk. Instances of significant or heightened exposure toreputation risk are escalated to BMO’s Reputation Risk Management Committee (RRMC) for review. As misconduct can impact our reputation, theChief Ethics Officer, who is responsible for enterprise-wide reporting on employee conduct, may escalate instances of misconduct involving signif icant\\nreputation risk to BMO’s RRMC for review, as appropriate.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 109\\n\\n\\n## Page 98\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAccounting Matters and Disclosure and Internal Control\\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\\nThe most significant assets and liabilities for which we must make estimates and judgments include: allowance for credit losses; financial instrume nts\\nmeasured at fair value; pension and other employee future benefits; impairment of securities and investments in associates and joint ventures;income taxes and deferred tax assets; goodwill and intangible assets; insurance contract liabilities; provisions, including legal proceedings an d\\nrestructuring charges; transfers of financial assets; consolidation of structured entities (SEs); and valuation of the Bank of the West assets acqu ired and\\nliabilities assumed. We make judgments in assessing the business model for financial assets, as well as whether substantially all risks and rewardshave been transferred in respect of transfers of financial assets and whether we control structured entities. These judgments are discussed in Notes 6\\nand 7 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements. Note 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements provides furtherdetails on the estimates and judgments made in determining the fair value of financial instruments. If actual results were to differ from theseestimates, the impact would be recorded in future periods.\\nBy their nature, the judgments and estimates that we make for the purposes of preparing financial statements relate to matters that are\\ninherently uncertain. However, we have detailed policies and control procedures in place that are intended to ensure the judgments made inestimating these amounts are well-controlled, independently reviewed and consistently applied from period to period. We believe that the estimate s\\nof the values of our assets and liabilities are appropriate.\\nFor a more detailed discussion of the use of estimates, refer to Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\nThe allowance for credit losses primarily consists of allowances for impaired loans and allowances for performing loans. Our approach to establishi ng\\nand maintaining the allowance on performing loans is based on the requirements of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), and considering the\\nguideline issued by OSFI. Under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) methodology, an allowance is recorded for expected credit losses on financialassets, regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. In particular, the ECL requirements of IFRS 9 incorporate the following elementsthat are subject to a high level of judgment: measuring 12-month and lifetime credit losses; determining when a significant increase in credit risk ha s\\noccurred; forecasting forward-looking information for multiple scenarios and determining the probability weighting of each scenario; and applic ation\\nof experienced credit judgment.\\nECL is calculated on a probability-weighted basis, based on four economic scenarios, and is calculated for each exposure in the portfolio as a\\nfunction of the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD), with the timing of the loss also considered. Wherethere has been a significant increase in credit risk, lifetime ECL is recorded; otherwise, 12 months of ECL is generally recorded. The determination o fa\\nsignificant increase in credit risk requires consideration of many different factors that will vary by product and risk segment. The main factorsconsidered in making this determination are the change in PD since origination and certain other criteria, such as 30-day past due and watchliststatus. We may apply experienced credit judgment to reflect factors not captured in the results produced by the ECL models, as we deem necessary.We apply experienced credit judgment to reflect the impact of the uncertain environment on credit conditions and the economy. We have controlsand processes in place to govern the ECL process, including judgments and assumptions used in determining the allowance on performing loans.These judgments and assumptions will change over time, and the impact of any such change will be recorded in future periods.\\nIn establishing our allowance on performing loans, we attach probability weightings to economic scenarios, which are representative of our view\\nof economic and market conditions. In fiscal 2024, we added a fourth scenario to reflect a less severe downside, allowing us to expand the range ofeconomic forecasts used in the allowance estimation. The base scenario represents our view of the most probable outcome, as well as upside,downside and severe downside scenarios, and are all developed by our Economics group.\\nThe allowance on performing loans is sensitive to changes in economic forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each forecast scenario.\\nWhen changes in economic performance in the forecasts are measured, we use real GDP as the basis, which acts as the key driver for movements inmany of the other economic and market variables used, including the equity volatility index (VIX), corporate BBB credit spreads, unemployment rates ,\\nhousing price indices and consumer credit. We also consider industry-specific variables, where applicable. Many of the variables have a high degree of\\ninterdependency, and as such, there is no single factor to which the allowances as a whole are sensitive. Holding all else constant, as economicvariables worsen, the allowance on performing loans would increase and conversely, as they improve, the allowance would decrease. In addition,assuming all variables are held constant, an increase in loan balances or a deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio would each drive a n\\nincrease in the allowance on performing loans.\\nInformation on the provision for credit losses for the years ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 can be found in the Total Provision for Credit Losses\\nsection. Additional information on the process and methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses can be found in the discussion ofCredit and Counterparty Risk, as well as in Note 4 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\\nWe record assets and liabilities classified as held for trading, assets and liabilities designated at fair value, derivatives, certain equity and de bt\\nsecurities and securities sold but not yet purchased at fair value. Fair value represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset orpaid on the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between willing parties at the measurement date. We employ a fair value hierarchy basedon inputs we use in valuation techniques to measure the fair value of our financial instruments. The extent of our use of quoted market prices(Level 1), internal models with observable market information (Level 2) and internal models without observable market information (Level 3) in thevaluation of loans, securities, derivatives, certain other assets and liabilities recorded at fair value as at October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 i s\\n110 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 99', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 13, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667380', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 99\\n\\n                          MD&A                          disclosed in Note 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.

It meets at least monthly to address the more challenging valuation issues related to\\nour portfolios, approves valuation methodology changes as needed to enhance the reliability of our fair value estimates, and is a key forum for thediscussion of sources of valuation uncertainty and how these have been addressed by management. Certain financial instruments, including corporat e\\nequities, are valued by the respective business groups. Senior management oversees our valuation processes through various valuation and riskcommittees.\\nAs at October 31, 2024, total valuation adjustments were a net decrease in value of $268 million for financial instruments carried at fair value on\\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet (net decrease of $135 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nPension and Other Employee Future Benefits\\nOur pension and other employee future benefits expense is calculated by independent actuaries using assumptions determined by management.Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used are recognized in other comprehensive income.\\nPension and other employee future benefits expense, plan assets and defined benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in discount rates. We\\ndetermine discount rates at each year-end for all plans, using high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans’ specific cash flows.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for pension and other employee future benefits, including a sensitivity analysis for key assumptions ,\\nis included in Note 22 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nImpairment of Securities and Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\\nDebt securities measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are assessed for impairment using theexpected credit loss model. For securities determined to have low credit risk, the allowance for credit losses is measured with an amount equalto 12-month expected credit loss.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for debt securities measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, other securities, the related allowance for\\ncredit losses and the determination of fair value is included in Notes 3 and 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nWe review our investments in associates and joint ventures, included within other assets, at each quarter-end reporting period in order to\\nidentify and evaluate any investments that show indications of possible impairment. For these investments, a significant or prolonged decline in fa ir\\nvalue to an amount below cost is objective evidence of impairment.\\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\\nOur approach to tax matters is guided by our Statement on Tax Principles, elements of which are described below, and governed by our tax riskmanagement framework, which is implemented through internal controls and processes. We operate with due regard to risks, including tax andreputation risks. We actively seek to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report any tax risks that may arise in order to understand our financialexposure to those risks. Our intention is to comply fully with tax laws. We consider all applicable laws in connection with our commercial activities,and where tax laws change in our business or for our customers, we adapt and make adjustments accordingly. We monitor applicable tax-relateddevelopments, including legislative proposals, case law and guidance from tax authorities. When an interpretation or application of tax laws is notclear, we take well-reasoned positions based on available case law and administrative positions of tax authorities, and we engage external advisorswhen necessary. We do not engage in tax planning that does not have commercial substance, and we do not knowingly work with customers webelieve use tax strategies to evade taxes. We are committed to maintaining productive relationships and cooperating with tax authorities on all taxmatters. We seek to resolve disputes in a collaborative manner; however, when our interpretation of tax law differs from that of tax authorities, weare prepared to defend our position.\\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in either the Consolidated Statement\\nof Income, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. In determining the provisionfor income taxes, we interpret tax legislation, case law and administrative positions in numerous jurisdictions and, based on our judgment, we recor d\\nthe estimate of the amount required to settle tax obligations. We also make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred taxassets and liabilities. If the interpretations and assumptions differ from those of tax authorities or if the timing of reversals is not as expected, t he\\nprovision for income taxes could increase or decrease in future periods. The amount of any such increase or decrease cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which\\ndeductible temporary differences or unused tax losses and tax credits may be utilized. We are required to assess whether it is probable that deferredincome tax assets will be realized. Factors used to assess the probability of realization are past experience of income and capital gains, forecasts o f\\nfuture net income before taxes, and the remaining expiration period of tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. Changes in our assessment of thesefactors could increase or decrease the provision for income taxes in future periods.\\nCanadian tax authorities have reassessed us for additional income tax and interest in an amount of approximately $1,465 million in respect of\\ncertain 2011-2018 Canadian corporate dividends. These reassessments denied certain dividend deductions on the basis that the dividends were\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 111\\n\\n\\n## Page 100\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nreceived as part of a “dividend rental arrangement”. In general, the tax rules raised by Canadian tax authorities were prospectively addressed in\\nthe 2015 and 2018 Canadian federal budgets. We filed Notices of Appeal with the Tax Court of Canada and the matter is in litigation. We remain ofthe view that our tax filing positions were appropriate and intend to challenge all reassessments. However, if such challenges are unsuccessful, theadditional expense would negatively impact net income.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for income taxes is included in Note 23 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. This assessment includes a comparison of the carrying value and the recoverable amount ofeach of our cash-generating units (CGUs) in order to verify that the recoverable amount of each CGU is greater than its carrying value. If the carryingvalue of a CGU were to exceed its recoverable amount, an impairment calculation would be performed. The recoverable amount of a CGU is thehigher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\\nFair value less costs to sell has been used to perform the impairment test in all periods. In determining fair value less costs to sell, we employ a\\ndiscounted cash flow model, consistent with that used when a business is acquired. This model is dependent on assumptions related to revenuegrowth, discount rates, synergies achieved on acquisition and the availability of comparable acquisition data. Changes in any of these assumptionswould affect the determination of fair value for each of our CGUs in a different manner. Management must exercise judgment and make assumptionsin determining fair value. Differences in judgments and assumptions could affect the determination of fair value and any resulting impairmentwrite-down.\\nAs at October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, no goodwill impairment was recorded, as the estimated fair value of the CGUs was greater than\\ntheir carrying value.\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized to income on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over a period not exceeding\\n15 years, depending on the nature of the asset. We test intangible assets with definite lives for impairment when circumstances indicate thatthe carrying value may not be recoverable.\\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment. If an intangible asset is determined to be impaired, it will be written\\ndown to its recoverable amount, the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, when this is less than the carrying value.\\nAdditional information regarding the composition of goodwill and intangible assets is included in Note 11 of the audited annual consolidated\\nfinancial statements.\\nInsurance Contract Liabilities\\nInsurance contract liabilities represent estimates of fulfillment cash flows, which include a risk adjustment, and the contractual service margin (CSM).\\nFulfillment cash flows include estimates of future cash flows related to the remaining coverage period and for previously incurred claims, which arethen discounted and probability weighted. This is based on non-financial risk assumptions including mortality, policy lapses and expenses, which a re\\nbased on a combination of industry and entity specific data, and in the case of expenses, on historical analysis of which expenses are attributable toinsurance operations. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect actual experience and market conditions. In addition ,\\nwe add a risk adjustment for non-financial risk to bring the confidence level on the sufficiency of reserves to 70%-80%. The CSM is a component ofthe liability representing the unearned profit we recognize as we provide services.\\nAdditional information on insurance contract liabilities is provided in Note 15 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements, and\\ninformation on insurance risk is provided in the Insurance Risk section and the Insurance Market Risk section.\\nProvisions\\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, we have a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it isprobable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the amountrequired to settle any obligation as at the balance sheet date, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. For example, BMOand its subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions in the normal course of business. Factors considered in estimating any obligation related to\\nthese legal actions include a case-by-case assessment of specific facts and circumstances, past experience and the opinions of legal experts.Management and internal and external experts are involved in estimating any amounts that may be required. Certain provisions also relate torestructuring initiatives that we have undertaken. These provisions are recorded at management’s best estimate of the amounts that will ultimatelybe paid out.\\nThe actual costs of settling some obligations may be substantially higher or lower than the amount of the provisions.Additional information regarding provisions is included in the Legal and Regulatory Risk section and in Note 25 of the audited annual\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nTransfers of Financial Assets\\nWe sell Canadian residential and commercial mortgages to third-party Canadian securitization programs, including the Canada Mortgage BondProgram, and directly to third-party investors under the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities program.\\nWe also purchase or originate certain commercial mortgage loans that are subsequently sold and derecognized, and we purchase U.S.\\ngovernment agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) issued by third-party sponsored vehicles, which we may further securitize byrepackaging them into new CMOs prior to selling to third-party investors.\\nWe assess whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of, or control over, the assets have been transferred in order to determine if they\\nqualify for derecognition. Where we continue to be exposed to substantially all of the prepayment, interest rate and/or credit risk associated with t he\\nsecuritized assets, they do not qualify for derecognition. We continue to recognize these financial instruments, and recognize the related cashproceeds as a secured financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n112 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 101\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Consolidation of Structured Entities\\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into arrangements with SEs as described in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section. We are required\\nto consolidate a SE if we control the SE. We control a SE when we have power over the SE, exposure or rights to variable returns as a result of ourinvolvement, and the ability to exercise power to affect the amount of those returns. For certain SEs, we exercise judgment in determining whetherwe control the entity.\\nAdditional information concerning our interests in SEs is included in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section, as well as in Note 7 of the\\naudited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition of Bank of the West – Valuation of Assets and Liabilities\\nSignificant judgments and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the Bank of the West assets acquired and liabilities assumed,including the loan portfolio, core deposit and other relationship intangible assets and fixed-maturity deposits.\\nAdditional information regarding the accounting for this acquisition is included in Notes 4 and 10 of the audited annual consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\nCautionThis Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section contains forward-looking statements.

Upon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for the\\nmeasurement of investment properties, included in insurance-related assets in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, from cost to fairvalue. These changes were applied retrospectively to our fiscal 2023 results.\\nFurther details can be found in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nIFRS 9, Financial Instruments\\nEffective November 1, 2023, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy to account for regular way contracts to buy or sell financial assets on the\\ntrade date, instead of on the settlement date, and applied this change retrospectively.\\nIAS 12, Income Taxes\\nEffective November 1, 2023, we adopted an amendment to IAS 12, Income Taxes (IAS 12), which narrows the IAS 12 exemption to exclude\\ntransactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.\\nFurther details can be found in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nFuture Changes in Accounting Policies\\nIFRS 9, Financial Instruments\\nIn May 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), which introduce\\nadditional guidance in two areas. The first relates to financial assets with contingent features and when these features can be considered consisten t\\nwith a basic lending arrangement, in which case the instrument can be measured at amortized cost. The second relates to the timing of derecognitionof financial liabilities when payment takes place through an electronic payment system and certain conditions are met. These amendments will beeffective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of these amendments on our consolidated financialstatements.\\nIAS 12, Income Taxes\\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 12. The amendment addresses concerns around accounting for the global minimum top-up tax, as\\noutlined in the two-pillar plan for international tax reform developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/G20 Inclusiv e\\nFramework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. The amendment to IAS 12 includes temporary mandatory relief from recognizing and disclosingdeferred taxes related to the top-up tax. We have applied the temporary mandatory relief related to deferred taxes in jurisdictions in which weoperate where the top-up tax legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted. The global minimum tax rules will be effective for our fiscal yearbeginning November 1, 2024, and as a result, we expect an increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 of up to 65 basis points.\\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\\nIn April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18), which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\\nFinancial Statements , and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2027. IFRS 18 changes how information is grouped and\\npresented in the financial statements, and requires that certain management performance measures be included in the financial statements. We arecurrently assessing the impact of the standard on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\\nCautionThis Future Changes in Accounting Policies section contains forward-looking statements.

Beginning January 1, 2024, we no longer report this revenue related tocertain Canadian dividends on a taxable equivalent basis in BMO Capital Markets.\\nIn addition, the legislation included the Global Minimum Tax Act , which introduced a 15% global minimum tax on income earned by large\\nmultinational groups and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2024, as noted in the Future Changes in Accounting Policies –IAS 12, Income Taxes section.\\nU.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Assessment\\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) approved the final rule to implement the special assessment on depository\\ninstitutions to recover the losses incurred in the deposit insurance fund that were attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors of Silico n\\nValley Bank and Signature Bank. BMO recorded a $357 million ($476 million pre-tax) charge related to the FDIC special assessment in fiscal 2024. Weexpect further refinements of the amount of the special assessment in subsequent periods as the FDIC has greater visibility of the final loss amounts.\\nInterbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform\\nBMO has transitioned all exposure to Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) settings to alternative reference rates as at October 31, 2024.

The audit report states in its conclus ion\\nthat, in KPMG’s opinion, BMO maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at October 31, 2024, inaccordance with the criteria established in the 2013 COSO Framework.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended October 31, 2024 which materially affected, or arereasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n116 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 105\\n\\n         Supplemental Information         Supplemental Information\\nTen-Year Statistical Review\\nTABLE 64\\n($ millions)\\nAs at or for the year ended October 31 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015\\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet\\nAssetsCash and cash equivalents 65,098 77,934 87,466 93,261 57,408 48,803 42,142 32,599 31,653 40,295\\nInterest bearing deposits with banks 3,640 4,109 5,677 8,303 9,035 7,987 8,305 6,490 4,449 7,382\\nSecurities 396,880 320,084 272,551 232,849 234,260 189,438 180,935 163,198 149,985 130,918\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements 110,907 115,662 113,194 107,382 111,878 104,004 85,051 75,047 66,646 68,066\\nLoans, net of allowances 678,016 656,665 551,814 458,262 447,420 426,984 384,172 358,507 357,518 321,531\\nOther 155,106 172,552 142,695 88,118 89,260 74,979 72,688 73,763 77,709 73,689\\nTotal assets 1,409,647 1,347,006 1,173,397 988,175 949,261 852,195 773,293 709,604 687,960 641,881\\nLiabilities\\nDeposits 982,440 910,879 776,547 685,631 659,034 568,143 520,928 479,792 470,281 438,169\\nOther 334,544 351,776 317,662 238,128 225,218 225,981 199,862 180,438 170,910 159,383\\nSubordinated debt 8,377 8,228 8,150 6,893 8,416 6,995 6,782 5,029 4,439 4,416\\nTotal liabilities 1,325,361 1,270,883 1,102,359 930,652 892,668 801,119 727,572 665,259 645,630 601,968\\nTotal equity 84,286 76,123 71,038 57,523 56,593 51,076 45,721 44,345 42,330 39,913\\nTotal liabilities and equity 1,409,647 1,347,006 1,173,397 988,175 949,261 852,195 773,293 709,604 687,960 641,881\\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Income\\nNet interest income 19,468 18,681 15,885 14,310 13,971 12,888 11,438 11,275 10,945 9,796\\nNon-interest revenue 13,327 10,578 17,825 12,876 11,215 12,595 11,467 10,832 10,015 9,593\\nTotal revenue 32,795 29,259 33,710 27,186 25,186 25,483 22,905 22,107 20,960 19,389\\nInsurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit\\nliabilities (CCPB)\\n(1) – – (683) 1,399 1,708 2,709 1,352 1,538 1,543 1,254\\nProvision for credit losses (PCL) 3,761 2,178 313 20 2,953 872 662 746 771 544\\nNon-interest expense 19,499 21,134 16,194 15,509 14,177 14,630 13,477 13,192 12,916 12,250\\nIncome before income taxes 9,535 5,947 17,886 10,258 6,348 7,272 7,414 6,631 5,730 5,341\\nProvision for income taxes 2,208 1,510 4,349 2,504 1,251 1,514 1,961 1,292 1,100 936\\nNet income 7,327 4,437 13,537 7,754 5,097 5,758 5,453 5,339 4,630 4,405\\nNet income available to common shareholders 6,932 4,094 13,306 7,510 4,850 5,547 5,269 5,153 4,471 4,253\\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\\nPreferred shares and other equity instruments 8,087 6,958 6,308 5,558 6,598 5,348 4,340 4,240 3,840 3,240\\nCommon shares 23,921 22,941 17,744 13,599 13,430 12,971 12,929 13,032 12,539 12,313\\nContributed surplus 354 328 317 313 302 303 300 307 294 299\\nRetained earnings 46,469 44,006 45,117 35,497 30,745 28,725 25,850 23,700 21,207 18,930\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 5,419 1,862 1,552 2,556 5,518 3,729 2,302 3,066 4,426 4,640\\nNon-controlling interest in subsidiaries 36 2 8 –––––– 2 4 4 9 1\\nTotal equity 84,286 76,123 71,038 57,523 56,593 51,076 45,721 44,345 42,330 39,913\\nBMO adopted various new and amended IFRS standards in 2015, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) in 2018 and IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16) in 2020 prospectively, with no changes to prior periods.

The CAR Guideline is not made pursuant to subsections 485(2) or 949(2) of the BA, or to subsection 473(2) of the TLCA. However, the capital standards set out in this guideline together with the leverage r equirements set out in the Leverage Requirements Guideline provide \\nthe framework within which the Superintendent assesses whether a bank, a bank holding company, a trust company, or a loan company maintains adequate capital pursuant to the Acts. For this purpose, the Superintendent has established two minimum standards: the leverage ratio described in the Leverage Requirements Guideline, and the risk- based capital ratio described in \\nthis guideline.\\n1 The first test provides an overall measure of the adequacy of an institution's \\ncapital. The second measure focuses on risk faced by the institution. Notwithstanding that a bank, bank holding company, trust company, or loan company may meet these standards , the \\nSuperintendent may direct a bank or bank holding company to increase its capital under subsections 485(3) or 949(3) of the BA, or a trust company or a loan company to increase its capital under subsection 473(3) of the TLCA.  OSFI, as a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, participated in the development of the Basel capital framework on which this guideline is based. Where relevant, the Basel framework paragraph numbers are provided in square brackets at the end of each \\nparagraph referencing material from the Basel framework.  \\n \\n1    The capital and leverage requirements for domestic systemically important banks are supplemented by the \\nrequirements described in OSFI’s Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Guideline .   \\n\\n\\n## Page 2\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 2 Chapter 1  - Overview of risk -based capital \\nrequirements  \\n \\nThe Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) for banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies are set out in nine chapters, each of which has been issued as a separate document.

Outlined below is an overview of the capital adequacy requirements for banks \\n(including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, and federally regulated loan companies , collectively referred to as ‘institutions’.  \\n 2. This chapter is drawn from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Basel \\nFramework published on the Bank for I nternational S ettlements (BIS)  website .\\n2 For reference, \\nthe Basel paragraph numbers that are associated with the text appearing in this chapter are indicated in square brackets at the end of each paragraph .\\n3  \\n \\n1. 1. Scope of Application  \\n 3. The capital adequacy requirements outlined in this guideline apply on a consolidated \\nbasis to the following institutions:  \\na. all institutions designated  by OSFI as domestic systemically important banks (D -\\nSIBs); and  \\nb. small and medium- sized deposit -taking institutions (SMSBs\\n4), which fall into \\nCategories I, II or III as defined in OSFI’s SMSB Capital and Liquidity Requirements Guideline.\\n5  \\n 4. The consolidated entity includes all subsidiaries except insurance subsidiaries.\\n OSFI \\nexpects institutions to hold capital within the consolidated group in a manner that is consistent with the level and location of risk.    \\n1. 2. Regulatory Capital  \\n 5. Total capital consists of the sum of the following elements: \\ni. Tier 1 capital, consisting  of: \\na. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ; and  \\nb. Additional Tier 1 capital  \\nii. Tier 2 capital  \\n \\n \\n2    The Basel Framework   \\n3  Following the form at: [Basel Framework, XXX yy.zz]  \\n4    SMSBs are banks (including federal credit unions), bank holding companies, federally regulated trust companies, \\nand federally regulated loan companies that have not been designated by OSFI as domestic systemically \\nimpo rtant banks (D -SIBs). This includes subsidiaries of SMSBs or D -SIBs that are banks (including federal \\ncredit unions) , federally regulated trust companies or federally regulated loan companies.  \\n5    SMSB Capital and Liquidity Guideline  \\n\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 5 6. The criteria for the capital elements comprising the two tiers, as well as the various \\nlimits, restrictions and regulatory adjustments to which they are subject, are de scribed in \\nChapter  2. \\n \\n1. 3. Total Risk -weighted Assets \\n \\n7. Risk-weighted assets (RWA) make up the denominator of the risk- based capital ratios, \\nand is calculated as the higher of:  \\na. the sum of the following three elements:  \\ni. RWA for credit risk;  \\nii. RWA for market risk; and  \\niii. RWA for operational risk; and \\nb. the adjusted RWA determined as per the capital floor described in section 1.5. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.4]  \\n 1.3.1. Credit Risk   8. RWA for credit risk (including counterparty credit risk) is calculated as the sum of:  \\na. Credit  RWA for banking book exposures which, except the RWA listed in (b) \\nthrough (e) below, is calculated using:   \\ni. the standar dized approach (as set out in Chapter 4); or  \\nii. the Internal Ratings -Based (IRB) approach (as set out in Chapter 5).  \\nb. RWA for counterparty credit risk from banking book exposures and trading book exposures (as set out in Chapter 7), except the exposures liste d in (c) and (f) below.  \\nc. Credit RWA for equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book calculated using one or more of the approaches set out in Chapter 4:  \\ni. The look- through approach \\nii. The mandate -based approach  \\niii. The fall -back approach  \\nd. RWA for se curitization exposures held in the banking book, calculating using one \\nor more of the approaches set out in Chapter 6:  \\ni. Securitization Standardized Approach (SEC -SA) \\nii. Securitization External  Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -ERBA)  \\niii. Securitization Internal Ratings -Based Approach (SEC -IRBA)  \\niv. Securitization Internal Assessment Approach (SEC -IAA)  \\nv.

RWA for exposures to central counterparties in the banking book and trading \\nbook, calculated using the approach set out in Chapter 7.  \\nf. RWA for the risk posed by unsettled transactions and failed trades, where the transactions are in the banking book or tra ding book and are within the scope of \\nthe rules set out in Chapter 7.  \\ng. RWA for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk for exposures in the trading and banking book, calculated as set out in Chapter 8 using either:  \\ni. The standardized approach for CVA; or  \\nii. The advanced approach for CVA.    \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.6]  \\n 9. Institutions that have total regulatory capital (net of deductions) in excess of CAD $5 \\nbillion, or that have greater than 10% of total assets or greater than 10% of total liabilities that are international ,\\n6 are expected to use IRB approaches for all material portfolios and credit \\nbusinesses in Canada and the United States.   \\n10. Under the IRB approaches, exposure at default (EAD) is determined gross of all specific \\nallowances. The amount used in the calculation of EAD should normally be based on book \\nvalue, except for the following where EAD should be based on amortized cost:  \\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge; and  \\n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensi ve Income.  \\n 11. Under the standardized approach, on- balance sheet exposures should normally be \\nmeasured at book value, except the following where exposures should be measured at amortized cost:  \\n• loans fair valued under the fair value option or fair value hedge;   \\n• debt and loans fair valued through Other Comprehensive Income; and  \\n• own-use property, plant and equipment  \\n 12. For own- use property that is accounted for using the revaluation model, reported \\nexposures should be based on an adjusted book value that reverses the impact of:  \\n• the balance of any revaluation surplus included in Other Comprehensive Income; and  \\n• accumulated net after -tax revaluation losses that are reflected in retained earnings or as a \\nresult of subsequent revaluations  \\n 13. The approaches listed  in paragraph 8 specify how institutions should measure the size of \\ntheir exposures (i.e. EAD) and determine their RWA. Certain types of transactions in the banking book and trading book (such as derivatives and securities financial transactions) give \\nrise to counterparty credit risk, for which the measurement of the size of the exposure can be \\ncomplex. Therefore, the approaches listed in paragraph 8 include, or cross refer to, the following methods available to determine the size of the counterparty exposures (refer to section 7.1 of Chapter 7 for a n overview of the counterparty credit risk requirements including the types of \\ntransactions to which the methods below can be applied):  \\n \\n6 This includes assets and liabilities booked outside of Canada as well as assets and liabilities of non -residents \\nbooked in Canada.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 7  \\na.

Market risk requirements, as outlined in Chapter 9, apply to internationally active \\ninstitutions and all institutions designated by OSFI as D -SIBs. OSFI retains the right to apply the \\nframework to other institutions, on a case -by-case basis, if trading activities are a large \\nproportion of overall operations. \\n \\n16. Institutions subject to market risk requirements must identify the instruments that are in \\nthe trading book following the requirements of Chapter 9. All instruments that are not in the trading book and all other a ssets of the institution (termed “banking book exposures”) must be \\ntreated under one of the credit risk approaches.

Approval to use Internal Model Based Approaches  \\n \\n21. Institutions  must receive explicit prior approval from OSFI in order to use any of the \\nfollowing model- based ap proaches for regulatory capital purposes: the Foundation and \\nAdvanced IRB Approaches to credit risk, the IMM to counterparty credit risk, and the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to market risk. The steps involved in the application for approval of these app roaches are outlined in OSFI Implementation Notes.  \\n 22. OSFI will consider approval with conditions for those institutions that have made a \\nsubstantial effort and are found to satisfy most requirements of the internal model regime. The institution must also b e able to provide out of sample back-testing and parallel reporting \\nconsistent with OSFI' s capital models implementation note .\\n8 Institutions that do not receive \\napproval will be required to employ a form of the Standardized Approach.  23. An institution achie ving approval with conditions for one of the model- based \\napproaches will normally be allowed to use the approach (in some cases only after OSFI confirms closure of certain deficiencies) but may be required to adhere to a higher initial capital floor. Once it achieves full compliance with all rollout and data requirements, and OSFI has agreed, the institution may proceed to the capital floor of 72.5% described in section 1.5. In either case, OSFI will not rule out the possibility of requiring floors on individual asset classes or reviewing approval conditions based on implementation progress.  \\n \\n24. Once approved, institutions are expected to meet the qualitative and quantitative \\nrequirements for the internal model approach as set out in the guideline and the supporting implementation notes on an ongoing basis.  1.4.1. Approval to use the IRB Approaches to Credit Risk  \\n 25. For IRB credit risk approval, besides meeting the qualitative and quantitative \\nrequirements for an IRB rating system, institutions will need, at a minimum, to satisfy the following requirements to obtain approval with conditions (with a possibly higher initial floor): \\n• The institution is meeting the IRB use test principles .\\n9 The use test prohibits institutions \\nfrom using default and loss estimates from their own internal ratings that are developed for the sole purpose of calculating regulatory capital, these systems must be used in other operations of the institution. \\n• On implementation, the institution will have rolled out the Advanced IRB (AIRB) or Foundation IRB (FIRB) approach to approximately 80% of its consolidated credit exposures, as of the end of the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the institution receives approval to use the IRB approach, measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit RWA.  \\n \\n \\n8      Implementation Note - Assessm ent of Regulatory Capital Models for Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n9     The Use of Ratings and Estimates of Default and Loss at IRB Institutions – Implemen tation Note  \\n\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 9 26. Once an institution has received an approval to use the IRB Approach, OSFI will \\nmonitor, on a quarterly basis, the institution’s compliance with the 80% IRB threshold for its \\nconsolidated credit exposures  for which an IRB approach is permitted. In the post -approval \\nperiod, compliance will be measured in terms of gross exposure and total credit risk- weighted \\nassets as at the applicable quarter.  \\n \\n \\n1. 5. Capital Floor –Internal Model Based Approaches  \\n \\n27. To reduce excessive variability of RWA and to enhance the comparability of risk- based \\ncapital ratios, institutions using internal model -based approaches for credit risk, counterparty \\ncredit risk, or market risk a re subject to a floor requirement that is applied to RWA. The capital \\nfloor ensures that institutions’ capital requirements do not fall below a certain percentage of capital requirements derived under standardized approaches . The calculation of the floor i s set \\nout below for institutions that have implemented the IRB approach for credit risk, IMM for counterparty credit risk, or IMA for market risk. Institutions that have only implemented the standardized approaches for credit risk, counterparty credit risk, and market risk are not subject to the capital floor.  \\n Institutions that have implemented one of the internal model -based approaches for credit risk, \\ncounterparty credit risk, or market risk must calculate the difference between:  \\ni. the capital floor as def ined in section 1.5.1, and \\nii. an adjusted capital requirement as defined in section 1.5.2. \\n[Basel Framework, R BC 20.11]  \\n 28. If the capital floor amount is larger than the adjusted capital requirement (i.e. the \\ndifference is positive), institutions are required to add the difference to the total RWAs otherwise calculated under this guideline. This adjusted RWA figure must be used as the denominator in the calculation of the risk -based capital ratios.  \\n 1.5.1. The Capital Floor  \\n \\n29. The base of the capital floor includes the standardized approaches to credit risk and \\noperational risk as described in paragraphs 31 through 35. The specific approach for market risk is described in paragraph 33. The capital floor is derived by applying an adjustment factor to the net total of the following amounts:  \\ni. total risk -weighted assets for the capital floor, less  \\nii. 12.5 times the amount of any general allowance that may be recognized in Ti er 2 capital \\nfollowing the standardized approach methodology as outlined in Chapter 2 of this guideline. \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 10\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 10 30. The adjustment factor is normally set at 72.5%. However, OSFI may set a higher or \\nlower adjustment factor for individual institutions. This factor will be phased-in over three years, \\nstarting at a 65% factor in 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in 2026.   \\nTable 1: Capital Floor Transition  \\nFiscal year  \\n 2023  2024  2025  2026 +  \\nFloor adjustment factor  65% 67.5%  70% 72.5%  \\n 31. Credit risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized approach as outlined in Chapter \\n4 of this guideline for all asset classes except securitization. The treatment of securitization exposures under the capital floor is outlined in section 6.11 of Chapter 6. Credit r isk RWAs also \\ninclude charges for central counterparty (CCP) exposures and non- Delivery -versus- Payment \\n(DvP) trades outlined in Chapter 7, and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) outlined in Chapter 8 of this guideline. \\n \\n32. For the exposure values used in the calculation of credit risk RWAs, the treatment of \\ncredit risk mitigation should follow the standardized approach outlined in section 4.3 of Chapter 4 of this guideline, while counterparty credit risk exposures must be determined using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk outlined in section 7.1.7 of Chapter 7 of this guideline. Additionally, in order to reduce the operational complexity of implementing the capital floor, institutions may choose to apply the IRB definition of default for IRB portfolios rather than applying the standardized approach default definition.  \\n \\n33. Prior to November 2023/January 2024,\\n10 market risk RWAs are calculated using the \\nvalue at risk (VaR ) and standardized approaches as outlined in Chapter 9 of the 2019 CAR \\nguideline, excluding the comprehensive risk measure (CRM, section 9.11.5.2), the incremental risk charge (IRC, Appendix 9-9), and stressed VaR (SVaR, paragraph 194i) capital charges. After November 2023/January2024, market risk RWAs are calculated using the standardized \\napproach as outlined in Chapter 9 of this guideline.   34. Operational risk RWAs are calculated using either the Standardized Approach or the \\nSimplified Standardized Approach, outlined in Chapter 3 of this guideline.  35. The following approaches are not permitted to be used, directly or indirectly, in the \\ncalculation of the capital floor:  \\na. IRB approach to credit risk;  \\nb. SEC-IRBA;  \\nc. the IMA for market risk;  \\nd. the VaR  models approach to counterparty credit risk; and  \\n \\n10  For institutions with a fiscal year ending October 31 or December 31, respectively.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 11 e. the IMM for counterparty credit risk.11  \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 20.12] \\n1.5.2. Adjusted Capital Requirement  \\n \\n36. The adjusted capital requirement is based on application of all of the chapters of this \\nguideline and is equal to the net total of the following amounts: \\ni. total risk -weighted assets, plus \\nii. 12.5 times the provisioning shortfall deduction, less \\niii. 12.5 times excess provisions included in Tier 2, less \\niv. 12.5 times the amount of general allowances that may be recognized in Tier 2 in respect of exposures for which the standardized approach is used. \\n 37. The provisioning shortfall deduction, excess provisions included in Tier 2, and general \\nallowances in Tier 2 in respect of standardized portfolios are defined in section 2.1.3.7 of Chapter 2 of this guideline.  \\n1. 6. Calculation of OSFI Minimum Capital Requirements  \\n 1.6.1. Risk -Based Capital Ratios for D-SIBs and Category I and II SMSBs  \\n 38. Institutions are expected to meet minimum risk -based capital requirements for \\nexposures to credit risk, operational risk and, where they have significant trading activity, market risk. Total risk -weighted assets are determined by multiplying  the capital requirements for \\nmarket risk and operational risk by 12.5 and adding the resulting figures to risk- weighted assets \\nfor credit risk. The capital ratios are calculated by dividing regulatory capital by total risk-weighted assets. The three ratios measure CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy and are calculated as follows:  \\nRisk Based Capital Ratios  =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\\n𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 \\n Where:  \\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \\nRWA =  Risk-weighted assets, calculated as described in paragraph 7. \\n 39. Table 2 provides the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios for institutions \\nbefore application of the capital conservation buffer.   \\n \\n11  There are two exceptions to this rule. One is that banks who have approval to use the IMM and who are \\ncurrently using the Standardized CVA (S -CVA) approach are permitted to use the IMM EADs and maturities in \\nthe calculation of the S- CVA for purposes of the capital floor. The other is that banks currently using the \\nAdvanced CVA (A -CVA) approach for purposes of the capital floor may continue to do so. Both of these \\nexceptions expire when the revised CVA framework is implemented in the first fiscal quarter of 2024.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 12\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 12 Table 2: Minimum capital requirements (in RWA)  \\nCET1  4.5%  \\nTier 1  6.0%  \\nTotal  8.0%  \\n \\n1.6.2. Simplified Risk -Based Capital Ratio for Category III SMSBs \\n 40.   Category III SMSBs are subject to a Simplified Risk -Based Capital Ratio (SRBCR), \\ncalculated as follows:  \\n \\nSRBCR  =  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\\n𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴\\n𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑇𝑇\\n𝑇𝑇\\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑅𝑅𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐴𝐴\\n + 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶𝑶  𝑹𝑹𝑶𝑶𝑹𝑹 𝑹𝑹 \\n Where:  \\n \\nCapital =  CET1, Tier 1, or Total capital as set out in Chapter 2. \\n \\nAdjusted Total Assets =  Total Assets from the Balance Sheet, less the aggregate of all adjustments to regulatory capital as  \\nset out in Chapter 2.  \\n \\nRWA \\nOperational Risk =  Risk-Weighted Assets for operational risk, calculated as \\ndetailed in Chapter 3 . \\n  41.

Mandated Capital Buffers  \\n 42. In addition to the minimum capital ratios, institutions are required to hold a capital \\nconservation buffer and, where applicable, a countercyclical buffer.    43. Outside of periods of stress, institutions should hold buffers of capital above the \\nregulatory minimum. The intent of these buffers is to increase institutions’ resilience going into a downturn and provide a mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help to ensure that capital becomes available to support the ongoing business operations of institutions through periods of stress. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.20]  \\n\\n\\n## Page 13\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 13 44. When buffers have been drawn down, there is a range of actions that can be taken to \\nrebuild buffers including reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include \\nreducing dividends or other discretionary payments on shares or other capital instruments, share buy-backs and, to the extent they are discretionary, staff bonus payments.\\n12 Institutions may also \\nchoose to raise new capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital. Should buffers be drawn down, institutions should implement a capital restorat ion plan for rebuilding buffers within a reasonable timeframe or, where the breach is \\nexpected to be corrected promptly, a plan that provides assurance that the capital conservation buffer will be restored on a sustained basis. The capital restoration plan should be discussed with \\nOSFI as part of the capital planning process. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.21]  45. Greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have been depleted. In \\nthe absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of earnings retained by institutions \\nfor the purpose of rebuilding capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirements. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.22]  46. It is not acceptable for institutions which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \\npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. It is also not acceptable for institutions that have depleted their capital buffers to use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.23] \\n \\n1.7.1. Capital Conservation Buffer  47. The capital conservation buffer establishes a safeguard above the minimum capital \\nrequirements and can only be met with CET1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of RWA .\\n13 Table 4 provides the minimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conversation buffer. \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.2]   \\n \\nTable 4: Capital conservation buffer (as % of RWA)  \\nCapital conservation buffer  2.5%  \\nMinimum capital ratios plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer  \\nCET1  7.0%  \\nTier 1  8.5%  \\nTotal  10.5%  \\n 48. Capital distribution constraints will be imposed on an institution when capital levels fall \\nwithin the buffer conservation range. Institutions will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall within the buffer range as they experience losses. The constraints imposed \\n \\n12    Applies only to performance bonuses issued to institutions’ senior management. The term “senior management”  \\nis defined in OSFI’s Corporate Governance Guideline .  \\n13   For Category  III SMSBs, the capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of [Adjusted Total Assets +  \\nRWA Operational Risk ] \\n\\n\\n## Page 14\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 14 relate only to distributions, not the operations of the institution. The distribution constraints \\nincrease as institutions’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design, the constraints imposed on institut ions with capital levels at the top of the range would be minimal. \\nThis reflects an expectation that institutions’ capital levels may fall into this range from time to time. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.2 and 30.3]  49. Table 5 sets out the minimum capital conservation ratios an institution must meet at \\nvarious levels of CET1 capital.\\n14 The applicable conservation ratio must be recalculated at each \\ndistribution date. Once imposed, conservation ratios will remain in place until such time as capital ratios have been restored. If an institution wants to make payments in excess of the constraints set out in Table 5, sufficient capital must be raised in the private sector to fully compensate for the excess distribution. This alternative should be discussed with OSFI as p art of an institution’s \\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For the purposes of determining the minimum capital conservation ratio , the CET1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% \\nminimum CET1 requirement, but excludes any additiona l CET1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and \\n8% Total Capital requirements , as well as any CET1 capital needed to meet D- SIBs’ Total Loss \\nAbsorbing Capacity (TLAC) requirements where applicable. For example, an institution with 8% CET1 and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but would have a 0%  capital conservation buffer and therefore be subject to the 100% constraint on \\ncapital distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \\nTable 5: Minimum capital conservation ratios for corresponding levels of CET1  \\nCET1 Ratio  Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios (expressed as percentage \\nof earnings)  \\n4.5% - 5.125%  100%  \\n>5.125% - 5.75%  80% \\n>5.75% - 6.375%  60% \\n>6.375% - 7.0%  40% \\n>7.0%  0% \\n 50. If an institution’s capital ratio falls below the levels set out in Table 4, capital \\nconservation ratios will be imposed that automatically limit distributions. As outlined in Table 5, these limits increase as an institution’s capital levels approach the minimum requirements. For example, an institution with a CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% would be \\nrequired to maintain the equivalent of 80% of its earnings in the subsequent payment period (i.e. \\npay out no more than 20% in capital distributions). For clarity, where an institution’s disclosed ratio is within the ranges where restrictions apply, distributions for the following payment period will be constrained based on the most recently reported ratio irrespective of the current capital position of the institution. Restrictions will remain in place until the capital conservation buffer is restored. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.4]  \\n \\n14  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where an institution breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital \\nrequirements. In the event that an institution simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 7% CET1, 8.5% Tier 1, 10.5% Total capital ) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio . \\n\\n\\n## Page 15\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 15 51. Items considered to be distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary \\npayments on CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments \\nto staff. Payments that do not result in a depletion of CET1, which may for example include certain stock dividends, are not considered distributions. The distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all of the following conditions: \\n (a) the dividends cannot legally be cancelled by the institution;  \\n(b) the dividends have already been removed from CET1; and \\n(c) the dividends were declared in accordance with the applicable capital conservat ion \\nratio set out in Table 5 at the time of the declaration.   \\n[Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  52. Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to the deduction of \\nelements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impacts of making such distributions are reversed out. Where an institution does not have positive earnings and has a shortfall in its C ET1, Tier 1, or Total Capital ratio, it will be \\nrestricted from making positive net distributions. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.5]  1.7.2. Countercyclical Buffer  \\n 53. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take \\naccount of the macro -financial environment in which institutions operate. It will be deployed \\nwhen excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system- wide \\nrisk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it again st future potential \\nlosses. [Basel Framework, RBC 30.7]  54. The countercyclical buffer regime consists, in Canada, of the following elements: \\n(a) OSFI, in consultation with its Senior Advisory Committee\\n15 (SAC) partners, will monitor \\ncredit growth and other indic ators16 that may signal a build -up of system-wide risks17 and \\nmake an assessment of whether credit growth is excessive and is leading to the build-up of system-wide risks. Based on this assessment, a countercyclical buffer requirement, ranging from 0% to 2.5% of total risk- weighted assets ,\\n18 will be put in place  when \\n \\n15  SAC is a non -statutory body chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance. Its membership is the same as the \\nFinancial Institutions Supervisory Committee (“FISC”), i.e. OSFI, the Department of Finance, the Bank of \\nCanada, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada. The SAC operates as a consultative body and provides a forum for policy discussion on issues pertaining to the financial sector.  \\n16  The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the countercyclical capital buffer , sets out the \\nprinciples that national authorities have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides informat ion that should help institutions to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national \\nauthorities in the jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 30.10]  \\n17  The Bank of Canada will be the primary source of public information on macro- financial developments and the \\nstate of vulnerabilities in Canada with regard to the countercyclical buffer, including as published in its Financial \\nSystem Review (FSR).  \\n18   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer requirement would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total \\nAssets + RWA Operational Risk ] \\n\\n\\n## Page 16\", 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'chunk_index': 0, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:07.307404', 'file_size': 554263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt1_0.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165506_263c93f7-5bcb-4741-b4f2-a6d0fff1aa15_car24_chpt1_0.pdf'}, {'page_content': \"## Page 16\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 16 circumstances warrant.

OSFI has designated six Canadian institutions as D -SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of \\nNova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto- Dominion Bank.\\n29 D-SIBs will be subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1% \\nof RWAs. The 1% capital surcharge will be periodically reviewed in light of national and international developments . This is consistent with the levels and timing set out in the BCBS D -\\nSIB framework. [BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.7 to 40.23]  \\n 66. The 1% surcharge will be implemented through an extension of the capital conservation \\nbuffer. This is in line with the tre atment of the higher loss absorbency requirement for global \\nsystemically important banks (G -SIBs) prescribed by the BCBS .\\n30 Table 7 below sets out the \\nminimum capital conservation ratios a D -SIB must meet at various CET1 capital ratios  and Tier \\n1 leverage ratio s.31 D-SIBs will thus be subject to a pre -determined set of restrictions on the \\n \\n25  The Superintendent will consider factors such as whether an institution’s business model involves providing \\ncredit through intermediation of funds or whether  the conditions that give rise to financial system -wide issues are \\nexplicitly addressed in a robust manner in the institution’s internal capital targets.  \\n26   The countercyclical buffer is to be computed and applied at the consolidated FRFI parent level, i. e. OSFI \\nregulated deposit -taking institutions who are subsidiaries of an OSFI regulated deposit -taking institution are not \\nsubject to the countercyclical buffer.  \\n27   The pre -announced buffer decision and actual buffer in place will be published on the BIS website.  \\n28   For Category III SMSBs, the countercyclical buffer would be applied as a % of [Adjusted Total Assets + RWA \\nOperational Risk ]. \\n29  Annex 1 contains additional details around OSFI’s process for designating Canadian institutions as D -SIBs.  \\n30   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6  \\n31  Similar capital conservation ratios apply where a D -SIB breaches its Tier 1 capital or Total capital requirements.  \\nIn the event that a D -SIB simultaneously breaches more than one capital requirement (e.g. 8% CE T1, 9.5% Tier \\n1, 11.5% Total Capital) it must apply the most constraining capital conservation ratio.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 19\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 19 ability to make distributions, such as dividends and share buy-backs, if they do not meet these \\nrequirements (see relevant provisions of section 1.7.1).  \\n \\n \\nTable 7: Minimum capital conservation ratios for D -SIBs at various ranges of \\nCET1  or Tier 1 Leverage Ratios  \\nCET1 Ratio  Tier 1 Leverage \\nRatio  Minimum Capital Conservation \\nRatio  \\n4.5% - 5.375%  3%–3.125%  100%  \\n>5.375% - 6.250%  > 3.125% –3.25%  80% \\n>6.250% - 7.125%  > 3.25% –3.375%  60% \\n>7.125% - 8.0%  > 3.375% –3.50%  40% \\n>8.0%  > 3.50%  0% \\n  \\n1. 9. Domestic Stability Buffer  \\n 67. In addition to the buffers described in sections 1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.8, D- SIBs are subject to \\na Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) .\\n32 The DSB is intended to cover a range of systemic \\nvulnerabilities that, in OSFI’s supervisory judgement, are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements described in this guideline. In addition to the DSB, D-SIBs may be required to hold further Pillar II capital, as warranted, to address idiosyncrat ic or systemic risks that are \\nnot adequately captured by the Pillar I requirements and buffers. Decisions on the calibration of the DSB are based on supervisory judgement, informed by analytical work on a range of vulnerabilities, and are made in consultation with the Financial Institutions Supervisory \\nCommittee (FISC) .\\n33 \\n \\n68. The level of the DSB will range between 0 and 4.0% of a D -SIB’s total RWA calculated \\nunder this guideline. The level of the DSB will be the same for all D- SIBs and must be met with \\nCET1 c apital.  \\n 69. Unlike the other buffers described in this guideline, the DSB is not a Pillar 1 buffer and \\nbreaches will not result in D -SIBs being subject to the automatic constraints on capital \\ndistributions described in section 1.7. If a D -SIB breaches the buffer (i.e. dips into the buffer \\nwhen it has not been released), OSFI will require a remediation plan. Supervisory interventions pursuant to OSFI’s Gu ide to Intervention\\n34 would occur in cases where a remediation plan is not \\nproduced or executed in a timely manner satisfactory to OSFI.   \\n \\n \\n32   Details related to the OSFI’s DSB are included on OSFI’s website : Domestic  Stability Buffer  \\n33   Established under section 18 of the OSFI Act, the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee consists of the \\nSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, the Commissioner of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, the \\nGovernor of the Bank of Canada, the Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \\nthe Deputy Minister of Finance.  \\n34  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n\\n\\n## Page 20\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 20 70. D-SIBs should take into account the DSB in their internal capital planning process. \\nAdditionally, D -SIBs should report the DSB in their quarterly public disclosures, and include a \\nbrief narrative on any changes to the buffer level. Breaches of the buffer by an individual D -SIB \\nwill require public disclosure pursuant to International Financial Reporting Standards (IF RS). \\n \\n71. The specific vulnerabilities covered by the DSB are expected to evolve over time, as they \\nare based on current market conditions in combination with forward -looking expectations around \\nthe materialization of risks to key vulnerabilities, and will be communicated as part of the semi -\\nannual DSB level -setting announcements. The decision to include a vulnerability will be based \\non whether it is measurable, material, cyclical and has a system -wide impact that could \\nmaterialize in the foreseeable future.  \\n \\n72. OSFI will undertake a review of the buffer on a semi -annual basis, and any changes to \\nthe buffer will be made public, in June and December, along with supporting rationale. In \\nexceptional circumstances, OSFI may make and announce adjustments to the buffer in -between \\nscheduled review dates. Transparency in setting the DSB will support institutions’ ability to use this capital in times of stress by improving the understanding of the purpose of the buffer and how it should be used.  \\n \\n73. Decreases of the buffer may occur in a situation when OSFI identifies that D -SIBs’ \\nexposures to the vulnerabilities have diminished or that risks have materialized. In the latter case, a decrease would be intended to allow D -SIBs to continue to provide loans and services to credit \\nworthy households and businesses and/or to incur losses without breaching their capital targets. Increases to the buffer may occur when OSFI is of the view that it would be prudent for D -SIBs \\nto hold additional capital to protect against the identified vul nerabilities. Increases will be subject \\nto a phase -in period; decreases will be effective immediately.  \\n \\n1. 10.  Capital Targets  \\n 74. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described in section 1.6, OSFI expects \\nall institutions to maintain target capital ratios equal to or  greater than the minimum capital ratios \\nplus the conservation buffer .\\n35 For SMSBs, this means target ratios of at least 7% for CET1, \\n8.5% for Tier 1 and 10.5% for Total capital. D -SIBs are expected to maintain target capital ratios \\nequal to or greater tha n the minimum capital ratios plus the sum of the conservation buffer, the \\nD-SIB surcharge and the DSB. For D -SIBs, this equates to target ratios of least 8% for CET1, \\n9.5% for Tier 1, and 11.5% for Total capital plus  the DSB .36 The target capital ratios fo r SMSBs \\nand D -SIBs are summarized below in Table 8 below and illustrated in Annex 2.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n35   The conservation buffer is the sum of the 2.5% capital conservation buffer plus any countercyclical buffer add-\\nons, where applicable.  \\n36   As an example, w here the DSB is set to 2% of RWA, D -SIBs’ target capital ratios would be at least 10% for \\nCET1, 11.5% for Tier 1 and 13.5% for Total capital. This reflects a conservation buffer of 2.5% and a D -SIB \\nsurcharge of 1.0%.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 21\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 21 Table 8: Target Capital Ratios  \\n \\n SMSBs  D-SIBs  \\nTarget CET1 capital  7.0%  8.0% plus DSB  \\nTarget Tier 1 capital  8.5%  9.5% plus DSB  \\nTarget Total capital  10.5%  11.5%  plus DSB  \\n \\n75. These targets are applicable to all institutions and are triggers for supervisory intervention \\nconsistent with OSFI’s Guide to Intervention.37 If an institution is offside the relevant target ratios, \\nsupervisory action will be taken proportional to the shortfall and circumstances that caused the shortfall and may include a range of actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on distribu tions.  \\n 76. The Superintendent may set higher target capital ratios for individual institutions or \\ngroups of institutions where circumstances warrant, including in respect of idiosyncratic and/or systemic risks that are not adequately captured by institutions ’ Pillar I capital requirements and \\nbuffers. The need for Pillar II capital and corresponding higher target capital ratios would consider how robust existing capital ratios are in light of an institution’s allowances, stress testing program, and ICAAP results .\\n38  \\n \\n \\n37  Guide to Intervention for Federally Regulated Deposit -Taking Institutions  \\n38  For OSFI’s expectations refer to Guideline E -18: Stress Testing  and Guideline E -19: Internal Capital Adequac y \\nAssessment Process (ICAAP) . \\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 22 Annex 1   Domestic Systemic Importance and Capital Targets  \\n \\n1. The framework39 for dealing with D- SIBs set out by the BCBS indicates that domestic \\nsystemic importance should be assessed with reference to the impact that an institution’s failure could have on the domestic economy. Further, it notes that this assessment should conside r \\ninstitution -specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter -connectedness and \\nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI’s assessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian ins titutions considers a range of \\nindicators such as asset size, intra- financial claims and liabilities, and an institution’s roles in \\ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI’s inferences from various measures of systemic importance.  \\n \\nSize  \\n 2. In general, an institution’s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \\nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity.  \\nWhen Canadian institutions are compar ed according to their size as measured by total \\nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are booked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: \\n• the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banki ng assets;  \\n• the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered; and \\n• relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank.  \\n \\nInter -connections \\n 3. The more inter -connected an ins titution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \\npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system and to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter- connectedness also inform \\ninstitutions’ systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of intra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra -financial liabilities (i.e. \\nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian banks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-connectedness measure under consideration.   \\n \\nSubstitutability  \\n \\n4. The systemic impact of an institution’s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \\nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI’s identification of D -SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \\ndomestic financial markets and in domestic f inancial infrastructures, which inform views \\nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial \\n \\n39  A framework for dealing with domestic systemically important banks  (BCBS : October 2012)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 23\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 -  Page 23 markets, and an institution’s shares of Canadian dollar payments made through Canada’s Large \\nValue Transfer System (LVTS) and the Automated Clearing and Settlement System (ACSS).40 \\nAgain, activity and volume in both LVTS and ACSS are dominated by the largest Canadian \\nbanks, and bank relative importance varies according to the measure of interest. The largest \\nbanks ar e also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \\nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \\nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \\nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian -dollar liquidity providers for \\nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network.  \\n \\n5. A variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \\nrange of evidence are the following:  \\n• The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \\ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   \\n• The rank -order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \\nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   \\n \\n6. This suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \\nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. Further, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from individual D -SIB failures is largely moot, given the diffi culty of credibly differentiating between \\nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest banks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D -SIBs to \\nassign degrees of systemic impo rtance.\\n  \\n 7. Given these various considerations, the Canadian D -SIBs are judged to be Bank of \\nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, and The Toronto -Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \\nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D -SIB given its importance relative to other less \\nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \\nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in tim es of stress. The designation of D -SIB \\nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \\n \\nHigher Loss Absorbency Targets  \\n \\n8. The goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \\nof a D -SIB relative to non- systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D -SIB failure \\nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy. This  surcharge takes into account \\nthe structure of the Canadian financial system, the importance of large banks to the financial \\narchitecture, and the expanded regulatory toolkit required to resolve a troubled financial \\n \\n40   ACSS handles all Canadian dollar payments not processed by the LVTS.  \\n41  CLS Bank provides a real -time global network that links a number of national payments systems to settle the \\nforeign exchange transactions of its member banks  \\n\\n\\n## Page 24\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 24 institution. The BCBS D- SIB framework pr ovides for national discretion to accommodate \\ncharacteristics of the domestic financial system and other local features, including the domestic \\npolicy framework. The additional capital surcharge for banks designated as systemically important provides credible additional loss absorbency given: \\n• extreme loss events as a percentage of RWA among this peer group over the past 25 years would be less than the combination of the CET1 (2.5%) capital conservation buffer and an additional 1%; and \\n• current business models of the six largest banks are generally less exposed to the fat tailed risks associated with investment banking than some international peers, and the six largest banks have a greater reliance on retail funding models compared to wholesale funding than some international peers – features that proved beneficial in light of the experience of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \\nFrom a forward -looking perspective:  \\n• Canadian D -SIBs that hold capital at current targets plus a 1% surcharge (i.e. 8%) \\nshould be able to weather a wide range of severe but plausible shocks without becoming non- viable; and  \\n• the higher loss absorbency in a crisis scenario achieved by the conversion to common \\nequity) of the 2% to 3% in Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 NVCC capital instruments \\npromoted by Basel III also adds to the resiliency of banks.  \\n Relationship with Basel Committee G -SIB Framework  \\n 9. OSFI has adopted the Basel Committee’s framewo rk on the assessment methodology for \\nG-SIBs. The assessment methodology for G-SIBs follows an indicator-based approach agreed by the BCBS that will determine which institutions are to be designated as G -SIBs and subject to \\nadditional loss absorbency requirements that range from 1% to 3.5% RWA, depending on an institution's global systemic importance.\\n42 For Canadian D -SIBs that are also designated as G -\\nSIBs, the higher of the D-SIB and G-SIB surcharges will apply.43  \\n Supervisory Implications  \\n 10. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have advanced practices in terms of the design and \\noperation of oversight functions and internal controls. OSFI expects these practices to continue to improve as supervision becomes more intensive and international best practices evolve. The institutions designated as D-SIBs have historically had, and will continue to be subject to, more intensive supervision because of their larger size, broader and more complex business models and consequently more significant risk profiles. The principles of risk based supervisory intensity are reflected in OSFI’s Supervisory Framework.\\n44 The Framework is applied on a \\nconsolidated basis to all Canadian institutions and requires OSFI supervisors to determine the \\n \\n42   BCBS Consolidated framework RBC 40.1 to 40.6 and SCO 40.1 to 50.20  \\n43   Details related to G -SIB’s annual public disclosure requirements are included in OSFI’s Global Systemically \\nImportant Banks – Public Disclosure Requirements Advisory    \\n44  OSFI’s Supervisory Framework  (OSFI: Febru ary 2011)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 25\\n\\n \\n  Banks/BHC/T&L   Overview of risk -based capital requirements  \\n  October 2023   Chapter 1 - Page 25 level, extent and intensity of the supervision of institutions based on the size, nature, complexity \\nand risk profile of the institution. OSFI’s enhanced supervision of D-SIBs includes the following: \\n• extensive use of supervisory colleges to share and coordinate supervision, including the execution of supervisory plans, with the relevant host country authorities of Canadian D -SIBs’ major foreign subsidiaries and affiliates;  \\n• greater frequency and intensity of on- and off- site monitoring of institutions’ risk \\nmanagement activities and corporate governance, including more granular reporting to OSFI and more structured interactions with boards and senior management; \\n• more extensive use of specialist expertise relating to credit risk, market risk, operational risk, corporate governance, and AML/compliance; \\n• stronger control expectations for important businesses, including the use of \\n‘advanced’ approaches credit, market and operational risks;  \\n• greater use of cross -institution reviews, both domestically and internationally, in \\norder to confirm the use of good risk management, corporate governance and \\ndisclosure practices;  \\n• selective use of external reviews to benchmark leading risk -control practices, \\nespecially for instances where best practices may reside outside Canada;  \\n• regular use of stress tests to inform capital and liquidity assessments;  \\n• setting, monitoring, and enforcing minimum and target TLAC ratios as set out in OSFI’s TLAC Guideline ; and  \\n• assessing D -SIBs’ recovery and resolution plans, as well as discussion of such plans \\nwith FISC partners and at crisis management groups.\\n45  \\n Information Disclosure Practices  \\n 11. Canadian D -SIBs are expected to have public information disclosure practices covering \\ntheir financial condition and risk management activities that are among the best of their international peers .\\n46 Enhanced disclosure of institutions’ risk models and risk management \\npractices can play a helpful role in enhancing market confidence. As a result, D- SIBs are \\nexpected to adopt the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Enhanced Disclosure Task Force,\\n47 future disclosure recommendations in the banking arena that are \\nendorsed by international standard setters and the FSB, as well as evolving domestic and international bank risk disclosure best practices.  \\n \\n \\n45   Consistent with the Financial Stability Board’s  Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Systemically \\nImportant Financial Institutions .

Treatment of counterparty credit risk and cross -product netting  \\n 2. This rule identifies permissible methods for estimating the Exposure at Default (EAD) \\nor the exposure amount for instruments with counterparty credit risk under this guideline.\\n3  \\nInstitutions may seek OSFI approval to make use of an Internal Modelling Method (IMM) meeting the requirements and specifications identified herein. As an alternative institutions may also use the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA- CCR).  [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 53.1] \\n7.1.1 Definitions and general terminology  \\n3. This section defines terms that will be used throughout this chapter. \\n \\n7.1.1.1 General terms  \\n \\n• Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR)  is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could \\ndefault before the final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. An economic loss would occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default. Unlike an institution’s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is unilateral and only the lending institution faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral risk of loss: the market value of the transaction can be positive or negative to either counterparty to the transaction. The market value is uncertain and can vary over time with the movement of underlying market factors.  \\n• A central counterparty  (CCP) is a clearing house that interposes itself between \\ncounterparties to contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance of open contracts. A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants through novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. For the purposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.   \\n• A qualifying central counterparty  (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as  a \\nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted by the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products \\n \\n1    The Basel Framework   \\n2  Following the format: [Basel Framework XXX yy.zz].  \\n3 In this document, the terms “exposure at default” and “exposure amount” are used together in order to identify \\nmeasures of exposure under both an internal ratings -based (IRB) and a standardi zed approach for credit risk.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 5\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 5 offered. This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised \\nin a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly indicated that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the CPSS -IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.  \\nWhere the CCP is in a jurisdiction that does not have a CCP regulator applying the \\nPrinciples to the CCP, then OSFI may make the determination of whether the CCP meets \\nthis definition.  \\nIn addition, for a CCP to be considered as a QCCP, the requirements in paragraph 204 \\nmust be met to permit each clearing member institution to calculate its capital requirement for its default fund contributions.  \\n• A clearing member is a member of, or a direct participant in, a CCP that is entitled to enter into a transaction with the CCP, regardless of whether it enters into trades with a CCP for its own hedging, investment or speculative purposes or wh ether it also enters \\ninto trades as a financial intermediary between the CCP and other market participants .\\n4  \\n• A client is a party to a transaction with a CCP through either a clearing member acting as \\na financial intermediary, or a clearing member guaranteeing the performance of the client \\nto the CCP.  \\n• Initial margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted to the CCP to mitigate the potential future exposure of the CCP to the clearing member arising from the possible future change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of the calculation of counterparty credit risk capital requirements, initial margin does not include contributions to a CCP for mutualized loss sharing arrangements (i.e., in case a CCP uses initial margin to mutualize losses among the clearing members, it will be treated as a default fund exposure). Initial margin may include excess collateral, in cases \\nwhere the CCP may prevent the clearing member and the clearing member may prevent the client from withdrawing the excess.   \\n• Variation margin means a clearing member’s or client’s funded collateral posted on a daily or intraday basis to a CCP based upon price movements of their transactions.  \\n• Trade exposures (in section 7.1.8) include the current\\n5 and potential future exposure of a \\nclearing member or a client to a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange traded derivatives transactions or securities financing transactions (SFTs), as well as initial margin.  \\n• Default funds , also known as clearing deposits or guaranty fund contributions (or any \\nother names), are clearing members’ funded or unfunded contributions towards, or underwriting of, a CCP’s mutualized loss sharing arrangements. The description given by \\n \\n4  For the purposes of this chapter, where a CCP has a link to a second CCP, that second CCP is to be treated as a \\nclearing member of the first CCP. Whether the second CCP’s collateral contribution t o the first CCP is treated as \\ninitial margin or a default fund contribution will depend upon the legal arrangement between the CCPs. OSFI \\nshould be consulted to determine the treatment of this initial margin and default fund contributions.    \\n5  For the pu rposes of this definition, the current exposure of a clearing member includes the variation margin due \\nto the clearing member but not yet received.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 6\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 6 a CCP to its mutualized loss sharing arrangements is not determinative of its status as a \\ndefault fund; rather, the substance of such arrangements will govern its status.  \\n• Offsetting transaction means the transaction leg between the clearing member and the CCP when the clearing member acts on behalf of a client (e.g. , when a clearing member \\nclears or novates a client’s trade). \\n \\n• A multi -level client structure is one in which institutions can centrally clear as indirect \\nclients; that is, when clearing services are provided to the institution by an institution which is not a direct clearing member, but is itself a client of a clearing member or another clearing client. For exposures between clients and clients of clients, we use the term “ higher -level client ” for the institution providing clearing services; and the term \\n“lower level client ” for the institution clearing through that client.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.6]  \\n \\n7.1.1.2 Transaction types  \\n \\n• Long Settlement Transactions are transactions where a counterparty undertakes to deliver a security, a commodity, or a foreign exchange amount against cash, other financial instruments, or commodities, or vice versa, at a settlement or delivery date that is contractually specified as more than the lower of the market standard for this particular instrument and five business days after the date on which the institution enters into the transaction.  \\n• Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) are transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and borrowing, and margin lending transactions, where the value of the transactions depends on market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements.  \\n• Margin Lending Transactions are transactions in which an institution extends credit in connection with the purchase, sale, carrying or trading of securities. Margin lending transactions do not include other loans that happen to be secured by securities collateral. Generally, in margin lending transactions, the loan amount is collaterali zed by securities \\nwhose value is greater than the amo unt of the loan. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.14]  \\n \\n7.1.1.3 Netting sets, hedging sets, and related terms  \\n \\n• Netting Set  is a group of transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a \\nlegally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is  recogni zed for \\nregulatory capital purposes under Chapter 4 or the Cross -Product Netting Rules set forth \\nin this chapter. Each transaction that is not subject to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement that is recogni zed for regulatory capital purposes should be \\ninterpreted as its own netting set for the purpose of these rules.  \\n• Hedging Set  is a set of transactions within a single netting set within which full or partial \\noffsetting is recognized for purposes of calculating the potential future exposure (PFE) add-on of the SA -CCR. .  \\n\\n\\n## Page 7\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 7 • Margin Agreement is  a contractual agreement or provisions to an agreement under \\nwhich one counterparty must supply collateral to a second counterparty when an \\nexposure of that second counterparty to the first counterpa rty exceeds a specified level.  \\n• Margin Threshold  is the largest amount of an exposure that remains outstanding until \\none party has the right to call for collateral.  \\n• Margin Period of Risk is the time period from the last exchange of collateral covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterpart until that counterpart is closed out and the resulting market risk is re -hedged.  \\n• Effective Maturity under the Internal Model Metho d for a netting set with maturity \\ngreater than one year is the ratio of the sum of expected exposure over the life of the transactions in a netting set discounted at the risk- free rate of return divided by the sum of \\nexpected exposure over one year in a ne tting set discounted at the risk -free rate. This \\neffective maturity may be adjusted to reflect rollover risk by replacing expected exposure with effective expected exposure for forecasting horizons under one year. The formula is given in paragraph 35.  \\n• Cross -Product Netting refers to the inclusion of transactions of different product \\ncategories within the same netting set pursuant to the Cross -Product  Netting Rules set out \\nin this chapter.  \\n• Current Market Value (CMV) refers to the net market value of the portfolio of \\ntransactions within the netting set with the counterparty. Both positive and negative market values are used in computing CMV. \\n[ Basel Fr amework, CRE 50.15]  \\n \\n7.1.1.4 Distributions  \\n \\n• Distribution of Market Values  is the forecast of the probability distribution of net \\nmarket values of transactions within a netting set for some future date (the forecasting horizon) given the reali zed market value of those transactions up to the present time.  \\n• Distribution of Exposures is the forecast of the probability distribution of market values that is generated by setting forecast instances of negative net market values equal to zero (this takes account of the fact that, when the institution owes the counterparty money, the institu tion does not have an exposure to the counterparty).  \\n• Risk -Neutral Distribution is  a distribution of market values or exposures at a future \\ntime period where the distribution is calculated using market implied values such as implied volatilities.  \\n• Actual D istribution is a distribution of market values or exposures at a future time \\nperiod where the distribution is calculated using historic or reali zed values such as \\nvolatilities calculated using past price or rate changes.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.22 to 50.25]  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 8\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 8 7.1.1.5 Exposure measures and adjustments  \\n \\n• Current Exposure is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction or portfolio \\nof transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon the default \\nof the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transactions in \\nbankruptcy. Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.  \\n• Peak Exposure  is a high percentile (typically 95% or 99%) of the distribution of \\nexposures at any particular future date before the maturity date of the longest transaction in the netting set. A peak exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the longest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.  \\n• Expected Exposure is the mean (average) of the distribution of exposures at any particular future date before the longest -maturity transaction in the netting set matures. \\nAn expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates up until the \\nlongest maturity date of transactions in the netting set.  \\n• Effecti ve Expected Exposure at a specific date is the maximum expected exposure that \\noccurs at that date or any prior date. Alternatively, it may be defined for a specific date as \\nthe greater of the expected exposur e at that date, or the effective exposure at the previous \\ndate. In effect, the Effective Expected Exposure is the Expected Exposure that is constrained to be non- decreasing over time.  \\n• Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of exp ected \\nexposures where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval. When calculating the minimum capital requirement, \\nthe average is taken over the first year or, if all the contracts in the net ting set mature \\nbefore one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract in the netting set.  \\n• Effective Expected Positive Exposure (Effective EPE) is the weighted average over time of effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if al l the contracts in the \\nnetting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest -maturity contract \\nin the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval.  \\n• Credit Va luation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid -market valuation of the \\nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of the credit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a counterparty. This a djustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty or the \\nmarket value of the credit risk of both the institution and the counterparty.  \\n• One-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment that reflects \\nthe mar ket value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does not reflect the \\nmarket value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty.  \\n• Debit Valuation Adjustment  is a valuation adjustment that reflects the market value of \\nthe credit  risk of the institution to the counterparty (i.e. changes in the reporting \\ninstitution’s own credit risk), but does not reflect the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution. [Added by OSFI]  \\n[ Basel Framework, CRE 50.26 to 50.33]  \\n\\n\\n## Page 9\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 9  \\n7.1.1.6 CCR -related risks  \\n \\n• Rollover Risk  is the amount by which expected positive exposure is understated when \\nfuture transactions with a counterpart are expected to be conducted on an ongoing basis, \\nbut the additional exposure generated by those future transactions is not included in calculatio n of expected positive exposure.  \\n• General Wrong -Way Risk arises when the probability of defaul t of counterparties is \\npositively correlated with general market risk factors.  \\n• Specific Wrong -Way Risk arises when the exposure to a particular counterpart is \\npositively correlated with the probability of default of the counterparty due to the nature of the transactions with the counterparty.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 50.34 to 50.36]  \\n7.1.2 Scope of application  \\n4. Banks  must calculate a counterparty credit risk charge for all exposures that give rise to \\ncounterparty credit risk, with the exception of those transactions listed in paragraphs  10 and 11 \\nbelow. The categories of transaction that give rise to counterparty credit ris k are:  \\n• OTC Derivatives;  \\n• Exchange -traded derivatives (ETDs)  \\n• Long Settlement transactions; and \\n• Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs)  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.4]  \\n 5. Such instruments generally exhibit the following abstract characteristics:  \\n• the transactions generate a current exposure or market value;  \\n• the transactions have an associated random future market value based on market variables;  \\n• the transactions generate an exchange of future payments or an exchange of a financial instrument (including commodities) against payment;  \\n• the transactions are undertaken with an identified counterparty against which a unique probability of default can be determined.\\n6 \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.5]  \\n \\n \\n6  Transactions for which the probability of default is defined on a pooled basis are not included in this t reatment of \\nCCR.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 10\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 10 6. Other common characteristics of the transactions to be covered may include the \\nfollowing:  \\n• collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in the nature of some \\ntransactions;  \\n• short -term financing may be a primary objective in that the t ransactions mostly consist of \\nan exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a relatively short period of time, usually for the business purpose of financing. The two sides of the transactions are not the result of separate decisions but form an indivisible whole to accomplish a defined objective;  \\n• netting may be used to mitigate the risk; \\n• positions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis), according to market \\nvariables . \\n• remargining may be employed. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.6]  \\n \\n7.1.3 Methods for Computing CCR Exposure  \\n7. For the transaction types listed in paragraph 4 above, banks must calculate their \\ncounterparty credit risk exposure, or exposure at default (EAD) ,\\n7 using one of the methods set \\nout in paragraphs 8 to 9 below. The methods vary according to the type of the transaction, the \\ncounterpar ty to the transaction, and whether the bank has received supervisory approval to use \\nthe method (if such approval is required). [Basel Framework, CRE 51.7]  \\n8. For exposures that are not cleared through a central counterparty (CCP) the following \\nmethods must be used to calculate the counterparty credit risk exposure:  \\n(1) The standardi zed approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures (SA -CCR), \\nwhich is set out in section 7.1.7. This method is to be used for exposures arising from OTC \\nderivatives, exchange -traded derivatives and long settlement transactions. This method must be \\nused if the bank does not have approval to use the internal model method (IMM).  \\n(2) The simple approach or comprehensive approach to the recognition of collateral, which are \\nboth set out in the credit risk mitigation section  of the standardi zed approach to credit risk (see \\nChapter 4, section 4.3). These methods are t o be used for securities financing transactions (SFTs) \\nand must be used if the bank does not have approval to use the value -at-risk (VaR) models or the \\nIMM.  \\n \\n7    The terms “exposure” and “EAD” are used interchangabl y in the counterparty credit risk chapters of the credit \\nrisk standard. This reflects the fact that the amounts calculated under the counterparty credit risk rules must \\ntypically be used as either the “exposure” within the standardi zed approach to credit ri sk, or the EAD within the \\ninternal ratings -based (IRB) approach to credit risk, as described in paragraph 13 . \\n\\n\\n## Page 11\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 11 (3) The VaR models approach, which is set out in Chapter 4, section 4.3. The VaR models \\napproach m ay be used to calculate EAD for SFTs, subject to supervisory approval, as an \\nalternative to the method set out in (2) above.  \\n(4) The IMM, which is set out in 7.1.5. This method may be used, subject to supervisory approval, as an alternative to the methods to calculate counterparty credit risk exposures set out in (1) and (2) above (for all of the exposures referenced in those bullets).  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.8]  \\n9. For exposures that are cleared through a CCP, banks must apply the method set out in \\nsection 7.1.8. This method covers:  \\n(1) the exposures of a bank to a CCP when the bank is a clearing member of the CCP;  \\n(2) the exposures of a bank to its clients, when the bank is a clearing member and acts as an intermediary between the client and the CCP; and  \\n(3) the exposures of a bank to a clearing member of a CCP, when the bank is a client of the \\nclearing member and the clearing member is acting as an intermediary between the bank and the CCP. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.8]  \\n10. Exposures arising from the settlement of cash transactions (equi ties, fixed income, spot \\nFX and spot commodities) are not subject to this treatment .\\n8 The settlement of cash transactions \\nremains subject to the treatment described in section 7.2. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.10]  \\n 11. As an exception to the requirements of paragraph 4 above, banks are not required to \\ncalculate a counterparty credit risk charge for the following types of transactions (i.e. the \\nexposure amount or EAD for counterparty credit risk for the trans action will be zero):  \\n(1) Credit derivative protection purchased by the bank against a banking book exposure, or \\nagainst a counterparty credit risk exposure. In such cases, the bank will determine its capital \\nrequirement for the hedged exposure according t o the criteria and general rules for the \\nrecognition of credit derivatives within the standardi zed approach or IRB approach to credit risk \\n(i.e. substitution approach). \\n(2) Sold credit default swaps in the banking book where they are treated in the framework as a \\nguarantee provided by the bank and subject to a credit risk charge for the full notional amount.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 51.16]  \\n \\n12. Under the methods outlined above, the exposure amount or EAD for a given \\ncounterparty is equal to the sum of the exposure  amounts or EADs calculated for each netting set \\n \\n8  For contributions to prepaid default funds covering settlement- risk-only products, the applicable risk weight is \\n0%.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 12\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 12 with that counterparty,9 subject to the exception outlined in paragraph 13. [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 51.11]  \\n \\n13. The exposure or EAD for a given OTC derivative counterparty is defined as the greater \\nof zero, and the difference between the following: the sum of EADs across all netting sets with \\nthe counterparty, and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for that counterparty which has \\nalready been recogni zed by the bank as an incurred write -down (i.e., a CVA loss). This CVA \\nloss is calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit valuation adjustments or \\nfunding valuation adjustments deducted from capital under Chapter 2 of this guideline. This reduction of EAD by incurred CVA losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA risk capital requirement.  [Basel Fr amework, CRE 51.13]  \\n 14. RWAs for a given OTC derivative counterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk \\nweight under the s tandardi zed or IRB approach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the \\ncounterparty. [Basel Framework, CRE 51.12]  \\n7.1.4 Approval to adopt an internal modelling method to estimate EAD  \\n15. An institution (meaning the individual legal entity or a group) that wishes to adopt an \\ninternal modelling method to measure exposure or EAD for regulatory capital purposes must seek OSFI approval. IMM is  available both for institutions that adopt the internal ratings -based \\napproach to credit risk and for institutions for which the standardi zed approach to credit risk \\napplies to all of their credit risk exposures. Only institutions subject to the market risk rules of Chapter 9 of this guideline are permitted to apply for the use of the IMM. The institution must meet all of the requirements given in s ection  7.1.5. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.1]  \\n 16. An institution may also choose to adopt an internal modelling method to measure CCR  \\nfor regulatory capital purposes for its exposures or EAD to only OTC derivatives, to only SFTs, \\nor to both, subject to the appropriate recognition of netting specified below in section 7.1.6. The institution must apply the method to all relevant exposures within that category, except for those that are immaterial in size and risk. During the initial implementation of the internal models method, an inst itution may use the SACCR for a portion of its business. The institution must \\nsubmit a plan to OSFI to bring all material exposures for that category of transactions under the IMM. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.2]  \\n 17. For all OTC derivative transactions and for al l long settlement transactions for which an \\ninstitution has not received OSFI approval to use the internal models method, the institution must use the SA -CCR. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.3]  \\n 18. Exposures or EAD arising from long settlement transactions can be de termined using \\neither of the methods identified in this guideline regardless of the methods chosen for treating OTC derivatives and SFTs. In computing capital requirements for long settlement transactions, institutions that hold permission to use the inter nal ratings -based approach may opt to apply the \\n \\n9  Where a single margin agreement applies to multiple netting sets and the SA -CCR is used, refer to paragraphs \\n166 to 167.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 13\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 13 risk weights under the standardi zed approach for credit risk on a permanent basis and \\nirrespective to the materiality of such positions. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.4]  \\n \\n19. After adoption of the internal model method, the institution must comply with the above \\nrequirements on a permanent basis. Only under exceptional circumstances or for immaterial \\nexposures can an institution revert to the SA -CCR for all or part of its exposure. In all cases, the \\ninstitution must ob tain approval from OSFI to do so and demonstrate that reversion to a less \\nsophisticated method does not lead to an arbitrage of the regulatory capital rules. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.5]  \\n7.1.5 Internal Model Method: measuring exposure and minimum  requirements  \\n7.1.5.1 Exposure amount or EAD under the internal model method  \\n20. CCR exposure or EAD is measured at the level of the netting set as defined in sections \\n7.1.1 and 7.1.6. A qualifying internal model for measuring counterparty credit exposure must \\nspecify the forecasting distribution for changes in the market value of the netting set attributable to changes in market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, etc. The model then computes the firm’s CCR exposure for the netting set at each future date given the changes in the market variables. For margined counterparties, the model may also captur e future collateral \\nmovements. Institutions may include eligible financial collateral as defined in section 4.3.3 and Chapter 9  in their forecasting distributions for changes in the market value of the netting set, if \\nthe quantitative, qualitative and data  requirements for internal model method are met for the \\ncollateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.6]  \\n 21. To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk for exposures \\nsubject to the IMM, institutions must use the greater of the portfolio- level capital charge (not \\nincluding the CVA charge in Chapter 8) based on Effective EPE using current market data and the portfolio- level capital charge based on Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress \\ncalibration should be a single consistent  stress calibration for the whole portfolio of \\ncounterparties. The greater of Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration should be applied on a total portfolio level and not on a counterparty by counterparty basis. [Basel Framework,  CRE 53.7]  \\n 22. OSFI expects institutions to have in place a policy for verifying the adequacy of, and \\nupdating, their choice of stress period. This policy would have to be approved in advance by OSFI as part of the IMM model approval process. Changes to this policy would constitute a major modification of the IMM model . \\n 23. To the extent that an institution recogni zes collateral in exposure amount or EAD via \\ncurrent exposure, an institution would not be permitted to recogni ze the benefits in its estimates \\nof LGD.  As a result, the institution would be required to use an LGD of an otherwise similar \\nuncollaterali zed facility. In other words, it would be required to use an LGD that does not \\ninclude collateral that is already included in EAD. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.8]  \\n 24. Under the IMM, the institution need not employ a single model. Although the following \\ntext describes an internal model as a simulation model, no particular form of model is required. \\n\\n\\n## Page 14\", 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 0, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199671', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 14\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 14 Analytical models are acceptable so long as they are subject to OSFI revi ew, meet all of the \\nrequirements set forth in this section and are applied to all material exposures subject to a CCR -\\nrelated capital charge as noted above, with the exception of long settlement transactions, which \\nare treated separately, and with the exception of those exposures that are immaterial in size and risk. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.9]  25. Expected exposure or peak exposure measures should be calculated based on a \\ndistribution of exposures that accounts for the possible non- normality of the distribution of \\nexposures, including the existence of leptokurtosis (“fat tails”), where appropriate. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.10]  26. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as the product of \\nalpha times Effective EPE, as specified below (except for counterparties that have been identified as having explicit specific wrong-way risk or specific right-way risk – see paragraph 65):  \\nEAD = α  × Effective EPE   (1) \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.11] \\n27. Effective EPE (“Expected Positive Exposure”) is computed by estimating expected \\nexposure ( EE\\nt) as the average exposure at future date t , where the average is taken across \\npossible future values of relevant market risk factors, such as interest rates, foreign exchange \\nrates, etc.  The internal model estimates EE as a series of future dates t 1, t2, t3…10. Specifically, \\n“Effective EE” is computed recursively, where the current date is denoted as t 0 and Effective \\nEEt0 equals current exposure: \\nEffective EEtk = max(Effective EE tk-1, EE tk)  (2) \\nwhere the current date i s denoted as t 0 and Effective EE t0 equals current exposure.   \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.12] \\n28. In this regard, “Effective EPE” is the average Effective EE during the first year of future \\nexposure. If all contracts in the netting set mature before one year, EPE is the average of expected exposure until all contracts in the netting set mature. Effective EPE is computed as a weighted average of Effective EE:  \\nmin(1 , )\\n1kyear maturity\\ntk\\nkEffective EPE EffectiveEE t\\n== ×∆ ∑  (3) \\nwhere the weights Δ tk = t k – t k-1 allows for the case when future exposure is calculated at \\ndates that are not equally spaced over time.  \\n \\n10  In theory, the expectations should be taken with respect to the actual probability distribution of future exposure \\nand not the risk- neutral one. OSFI recogni zes that practical considerations may make it more feasible to use the \\nrisk-neutral one. As a result, OSFI will not mandate which kind of forecasting distribution to employ.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 15\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 15 [Basel Framework, CRE 53.13]  \\n29. Alpha (α) is set equal to 1.4. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.14]  \\n \\n30. OSFI retains discretion to require a higher alpha based on a f irm’s CCR exposures. \\nFactors that may require a higher alpha include the low granularity of counterparties; particularly high exposures to general wrong- way risk; particularly high correlation of market values across \\ncounterparties; and other institution- specific characteristics of CCR exposures. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.15]  \\n7.1.5.2 Own estimates for alpha \\n31. Institutions may seek OSFI approval to compute internal estimates of alpha subject to a \\nfloor of 1.2, where alpha equals the ratio of economic capital from a full simulation of \\ncounterparty exposure across counterparties (numerator) and economic capital based on EPE (denominator), assuming they meet certain operating requirements. Eligible institutions must meet all the operating requirements for internal estimates of EPE and must demonstrate that their internal estimates of alpha capture in the numerator the material sources of stochastic dependency of distributions of market values of transactions or of portfolios of transactions across counterparties (e.g. the correlation of defaults across counterparties and between market risk and default). [Basel Framework, CRE 53.16]  \\n 32. In the denominator, EPE must be used as if it were a fixed outstanding loan amount. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.17]   33. To this end, institutions  must ensure that the numerator and denominator of alpha are \\ncomputed in a consistent fashion with respect to the modelling methodology, parameter specifications and portfolio composition. The approach used must be based on the firm’s internal economic cap ital approach, be well -documented and be subject to independent validation. In \\naddition, institutions must review their estimates on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the composition of the portfolio varies over time. Institutions must a ssess the \\nmodel risk given the significant variation in estimates of alpha can arise from the possibility for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator, especially where convexity is present . \\nThe assessment of model risk must be part of the independent model validation and approval process and model performance monitoring. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.18]   34. Where appropriate, volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in the joint \\nsimulation of market and credit risk should be condit ioned on the credit risk factor to reflect \\npotential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic downturn. Internal estimates of \\nalpha should take account of the granularity of exposures. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.19]  \\n7.1.5.3 Maturity  \\n35. If the original maturity of the longest -dated contract contained in the set is greater than \\none year, the formula for effective maturity (M) in Chapter 5 is replaced with the following:  \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 16\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 16  \\nwhere df k is the risk -free discount factor for future time period t k and the remaining symbols \\nare defined above. Similar to the treatment under corporate exposures, M has a cap of five \\nyears .11  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.20] \\n 36. For netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than one year, \\nthe formula for effective maturity (M) in Chapter 5 is unchanged and a floor of one year applies, \\nwith the exception of short-term exposures as described in Chapter 5 - Internal Ratings Based \\nApproach, section 5.4.1 (iv).  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.21] \\n37. For derivative contracts subject to paragraph 65 (SWWR) and st ructured such that on \\nspecified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of \\nthe contract is zero, the remaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \\n7.1.5.4 Margin agreements \\n38. If the netting set is subject to a margin agreement and the internal model captures the \\neffects of margining when estimating EE, the model’s EE measure may be used directly in equation (2). Such models are noticeably more complicated than models of EPE for unmargined counterparties. As such, they are subject to a higher degree of supervisory scrutiny before they are approved, as discussed below.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.22]  39. An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to capture the \\neffects of margining. It must take into account both the current amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties in the future. Such a model must account for the nature of margin agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the margin period of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the institution is willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model mus t either model the mark -to-market change in the \\nvalue of collateral posted or apply this guideline’s rules for collateral.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.23]  40. For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark- to-market valuation, a \\nsupervisory floor of five business days for netting sets consisting only of repo-style transactions, and 10 business days for all other netting sets is imposed on the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling EAD with margin agreements. In the following cases a higher supervisory floor is imposed: \\n \\n11  Conceptually, M equals the effective credit duration of the counterparty exposure. A bank that uses an internal model to \\ncalculate a one-sided credit valuation adjustment (CVA) can use the effective credit duration estimated by such a model in \\nplace of the above formula w ith prior approval of OSIF.  ≤\\n= >\\n≤\\n=×∆ × + ×∆ ×\\n=\\n×∆ ×∑∑\\n∑1\\n11\\n1\\n1k\\nk\\nkt year maturity\\nk kk k kk\\nk t year\\nt year\\nk kk\\nkEffective EE t df EE t df\\nM\\nEffective EE t df\\n\\n\\n## Page 17\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 17 • for all netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5,000 at any point during a \\nquarter, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of risk for the following quarter;  \\n• for netting sets cont aining one or more trades involving either illiquid collateral, or an \\nOTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of risk. For these purposes, “Illiquid collateral” and “OTC derivatives that cannot be easily replaced” must be determined in the context of stressed market conditions and will be characteri zed by the absence of continuously \\nactive markets where a counterparty would, within two or fewer days, obtain multiple price quotat ions that would not move the market or represent a price reflecting a market \\ndiscount (in the case of collateral) or premium (in the case of an OTC derivative). Examples of situations where trades are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, but are not l imited to, trades that are not marked daily and trades that are subject to specific \\naccounting treatment for valuation purposes (e.g., OTC derivatives or repo- style \\ntransactions referencing securities whose fair value is determined by models with inputs that are not observed in the market).  \\n• in addition, an institution must consider whether trades or securities it holds as collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the institution  would be able to replace its trades.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.24]  \\n 41. If an institution has experienced more than two margin call disputes on a particular \\nnetting set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the applicable margin period of risk (before consideration of this provision), then the institution must reflect this history appropriately by using a margin period of risk that is at least double the supervisory floor for that netting set for the subsequent two quarters. In the case of derivatives subject to Guideline E-22, this paragraph only applies to variation margin call disputes.  [Basel Framework, CRE \\n53.25]  \\n 42. For re -margining with a periodicity of N -days, the margin period of risk should be at \\nleast equal to the supervis ory floor, F, plus the N days minus one day. That is,  \\n Margin Period of Risk = F + N - 1. \\n \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.26]  \\n 43. Institutions using the IMM must not capture the effect of a reduction of EAD due to any \\nclause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.27]  \\n7.1.5.5 Model validation \\n44. In order to assure itself that institutions using models have counterparty credit risk \\nmanagement systems that are conceptually soun d and implemented with integrity, OSFI will \\nspecify a number of qualitative criteria that institutions would have to meet before they are \\n\\n\\n## Page 18\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 18 permitted to use a models -based approach. The extent to which institutions meet the qualitative \\ncriteria may influence the level at which OSFI will set the multiplication factor referred to in \\nparagraph 29 (Alpha). Only those institutions in full compliance with th e qualitative criteria will \\nbe eligible for application of the minimum multiplication factor. The qualitative criteria include:  \\n• the institution must conduct a regular programme of backtesting, i.e., an ex -post \\ncomparison of the risk measures12 generated by the model against reali zed risk \\nmeasures, as well as comparing hypothetical changes based on static positions with realized measures;  \\n• the institution must carry out an initial validation and an ongoing periodic review of its IMM model and the risk measures generated by it. The validation and review must be independent of the model developers;  \\n• senior management should be actively involved in the risk control process and must \\nregard credit and counterparty credit risk control as an essential aspect of the business \\nto which significant resources need to be devoted. In this regard, the daily reports \\nprepared by the independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of management with sufficient  seniority and authority to enforce both reductions of \\npositions taken by individual traders and reductions in the institution’s overall risk exposure;  \\n• the institution’s internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely integrated \\ninto the day- to-day risk management process of the institution. Its output should \\naccordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling \\nits counterparty credit risk profile;  \\n• the risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with inte rnal trading and \\nexposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits should be related to the institution’s risk measurement model in a manner that is consistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit function and senior management;  \\n• institutions should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented \\nset of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning the operation of the risk measurement system. The institution’s risk measurement system must be well documented, for example, through a risk management manual that describes the basic \\nprinciples of the risk management system and that provides an explanation of the empirical techniques used to measure counterparty credit risk;  \\n• an independent review of the risk measure ment system should be carried out regularly \\nin the institution’s own internal auditing process. This review should include both the activities of the business trading units and of the independent risk control unit. A review of the overall risk management p rocess should take place at regular intervals \\n(ideally no less than once a year) and should specifically address, at a minimum:  \\no the adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system and process;  \\n \\n12  “Risk measures” refers not only to Effective EPE, the risk measure used to derive regulatory capital, but also to \\nthe other risk measures used in the calculation of Effective EPE such as the exposure distribution at a series of \\nfuture dates, the positive exposure distribution at a series of future dates, the market risk factors used to derive \\nthose exposures and the values of the constituent trades of a portfolio.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 19\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 19 o the organi zation of the risk control unit;  \\no the inte gration of counterparty credit risk measures into daily risk management;  \\no the approval process for counterparty credit risk models used in the calculation \\nof counterparty credit risk used by front office and back office personnel;  \\no the validation of any sign ificant change in the risk measurement process;  \\no the scope of counterparty credit risks captured by the risk measurement model;  \\no the integrity of the management information system; \\no the accuracy and completeness of position data;  \\no the verification of the consi stency, timeliness and reliability of data sources \\nused to run internal models, including the independence of such data sources;  \\no the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions;  \\no the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation c alculations; and  \\no the verification of the model’s accuracy as described in paragraphs 45 to 48 . \\n• the ongoing validation of counterparty credit risk models, including backtesting, must be reviewed periodically by a level of management with sufficient authority to decide the course of action that will be taken to address weaknesses in the models. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.28]  \\n 45. Institutions must document the process for initial and ongoing validation of their IMM \\nmodel to a leve l of detail that would enable a third party to recreate the analysis. Institutions \\nmust also document the calculation of the risk measures generated by the models to a level of \\ndetail that would allow a third party to re -create the risk measures. This docu mentation must set \\nout the frequency with which backtesting analysis and any other ongoing validation will be conducted, how the validation is conducted with respect to data flows and portfolios and the analyses that are used. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.29]  \\n 46. Institutions must define criteria with which to assess their EPE models and the models \\nthat input into the calculation of EPE and have a written policy in place that describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be determined and remedied. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.30]  \\n \\n47. Institutions must define how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed for \\nthe purposes of validating an EPE model and its risk measures. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.31]  \\n \\n48. When validating EPE models and its risk measures that produce forecast distributions, \\nvalidation must assess more than a single statistic of the model distribution. [Basel Framework, \\nCRE 53.32]  \\n 49. As part of the initial and ongoing validation of an IMM model and its risk measures, the \\nfollowing require ments must be met: \\n\\n\\n## Page 20\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 20 • an institution must carry out backtesting using historical data on movements in market \\nrisk factors prior to OSFI approval. Backtesting must consider a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a range of various start (initializ ation) dates and covering a wide range of market conditions;  \\n• institutions must backtest the performance of their EPE model and the model’s relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions that support EPE. For collaterali zed trades, the prediction time horizons considered must include those \\nreflecting typical margin periods of risk applied in collaterali zed/margined trading, and \\nmust include long time horizons of at least one  year;  \\n• the pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for a given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as part of the ini tial and \\nongoing model validation process. These pricing models may be different from those used to calculate Market Risk over a short horizon. Pricing models for options must account for the non- linearity of option value with respect to market risk factor s; \\n• an EPE model must capture transaction specific information in order to aggregate \\nexposures at the level of the netting set. Institutions must verify that transactions are \\nassigned to the appropriate netting set within the model;  \\n• static, historical backtesting on representative counterparty portfolios must be a part of the validation process. At regular intervals, an institution must conduct such backtesting on a number of representative counterparty portfolios. The representative portfolios must be chose n based on their sensitivity to the material risk factors and \\ncorrelations to which the institution is exposed. In addition, IMM institutions need to conduct backtesting that is designed to test the key assumptions of the EPE model and \\nthe relevant risk me asures, e.g. the modelled relationship between tenors of the same \\nrisk factor, and the modelled relationships between risk factors;  \\n• significant differences between reali zed exposures and the forecast distribution could \\nindicate a problem with the model or the underlying data that OSFI would require the institution to correct. Under such circumstances, OSFI may require additional capital to be held while the problem is being solved;  \\n• the performance of EPE models and its risk measures must be subject to good backtesting practice. The backtesting programme must be capable of identifying poor performance in an EPE model’s risk measures;  \\n• institutions must validate their EPE models and all relevant risk measures out to time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure is calculated using an internal modelling method;  \\n• the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure must be regularly tested against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the ongoing model validation process;  \\n• the ongoing validation of an institution’s EPE model and the relevant risk measures \\ninclude an assessment of recent performance;  \\n\\n\\n## Page 21\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 21 • the frequency with which the parameters of an EPE model are updated needs to be \\nassessed as part of the validation process;  \\n• unde r the IMM, a measure that is more conservative than the metric used to calculate \\nregulatory EAD for every counterparty, may be used in place of alpha times Effective EPE with prior approval from OSFI. The degree of relative conservatism will be assessed up on initial OSFI approval and at the regular supervisory reviews of the EPE \\nmodels. The institution must validate the conservatism regularly; \\n• the ongoing assessment of model performance needs to cover all counterparties for which the models are used;  \\n• the va lidation of IMM models must assess whether or not the institution level and \\nnetting set exposure calculations of EPE are appropriate.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.33]  \\n \\n50. In the case where the pricing model used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure \\nis different than the pricing model used to calculate Market Risk over a short horizon, OSFI \\nexpects institutions to provide documented justification for the use of two different pricing models, including an assessment of the resulting model risk. \\n7.1.5.6 Operational requirements for EPE models   \\n51. In order to be eligible to adopt an internal model for estimating EPE arising from CCR \\nfor regulatory capital purposes, an institution must meet the following operational requirements. \\nThese include meeting the requirements related to the qualifying standards on CCR Management, a use test, stress testing, identification of wrong- way risk, and internal controls. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.34]  \\n Qualifying standards on CCR Management  \\n 52. The institution must satisfy its supe rvisor that, in addition to meeting the operational \\nrequirements identified in paragraphs 53 to 82 below, it adheres to sound practices for CCR management.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.35]  \\n Use test  \\n 53. The distribution of exposures generated by the internal model used to calculate effective \\nEPE must be closely integrated into the day- to-day CCR management process of the institution. \\nFor example, the institution could use the peak exposure from the distri butions for counterparty \\ncredit limits or expected positive exposure for its internal allocation of capital. The internal model’s output must accordingly play an essential role in the credit approval, counterparty credit risk management, internal capital a llocations, and corporate governance of institutions that seek \\napproval to apply such models for capital adequacy purposes. Models and estimates designed and implemented exclusively to qualify for the internal models method are not acceptable. [ Basel \\nFrame work, CRE 53.36]  \\n  \\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 22 54. An institution must have a credible track record in the use of internal models that \\ngenerate a distribution of exposures to CCR. Thus, the institution must demonstrate that it has \\nbeen using an internal model to calculate the distributio ns of exposures upon which the EPE \\ncalculation is based that meets broadly the minimum requirements for at least one year prior to approval. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.37]  \\n \\n55. Institutions employing the internal model method must have an independent control uni t \\nthat is responsible for the design and implementation of the firm’s CCR management system, \\nincluding the initial and ongoing validation of the internal model. This unit must control input data integrity and produce and analyz e reports on the output of the firm’s risk measurement \\nmodel, including an evaluation of the relationship between measures of risk exposure and credit and trading limits. This unit must be independent from business credit and trading units; it must be adequately staffed; it must repor t directly to senior management of the firm. The work of this \\nunit should be closely integrated into the day -to-day credit risk management process of the firm. \\nIts output should accordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, monitoring and controlling the firm’s credit and overall risk profile. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.38]  \\n 56. Institutions applying the IMM must have a collateral management unit that is \\nresponsible for calculating and making margin calls, managing margin call disputes and reporting levels of independent amounts, initial margins and variation margins accurately on a daily basis. This unit must control the integrity of the data used to make margin calls, and ensure that it is consistent and reconciled regularly with all relevant sourc es of data within the \\ninstitution. This unit must also track the extent of reuse of collateral (both cash and non- cash) \\nand the rights that the institution gives away to its respective counterparties for the collateral that it posts. These internal reports  must indicate the categories of collateral assets that are reused, \\nand the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit quality and maturity. The unit must also track concentration to individual collateral asset classes accepted by the institutions. S enior \\nmanagement must allocate sufficient resources to this unit for its systems to have an appropriate level of operational performance, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of outgoing calls and response time to incoming calls. Senior management must ensure that this unit is adequately staffed to process calls and disputes in a timely manner even under severe market crisis, and to enable the institution to limit its number of large disputes caused by trade volumes. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.39]  \\n 57. The institution’s collateral management unit must produce and maintain appropriate \\ncollateral management information that is reported on a regular basis to senior management. Such internal reporting should include information on the type of collateral (bot h cash and non-\\ncash) received and posted, as well as the size, aging and cause for margin call disputes.

The internal model used to generate the distribution of exposures must be part of a \\ncounterparty risk management framework that includes the identification, measurement, \\nmanagement, approval and internal reporting of counterparty risk.\\n13 This framework must \\ninclude the measurement of usage of credit lines (aggregating counterparty exposures with other \\ncredit exposure s) and economic capital allocation. In addition to EPE (a measure of future \\nexposure), an institution must measure and manage current exposures. Where appropriate, the institution must measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held. The use test  is \\nsatisfied if an institution uses other counterparty risk measures, such as peak exposure or \\npotential future exposure (PFE), based on the distribution of exposures generated by the same \\nmodel to compute EPE.

An institution  is not required to estimate or report EE daily, but to meet the use test it \\nmust have the systems capability to estimate EE daily, if necessary, unless it demonstrates to OSFI that its exposures to CCR warrant some less frequent calculation. It must choos e a time \\nprofile of forecasting horizons that adequately reflects the time structure of future cash flows and maturity of the contracts. For example, an institution may compute EE on a daily basis for the first 10 days, once a week out to one month, once a  month out to 18 months, once a quarter out \\nto five years and beyond five years in a manner that is consistent with the materiality and composition of the exposure. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.43]  \\n 61. Exposure must be measured out to the life of all contracts in the netting set (not just to \\nthe one -year horizon), monitored and controlled. The institution must have procedures in place to \\nidentify and control the risks for counterparties where exposure rises beyond the one -year \\nhorizon. Moreover, the forecasted inc rease in exposure must be an input into the firm’s internal \\neconomic capital model.  [Basel Framework, CRE 53.44]  \\n Stress testing  \\n 62. An institution must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the \\nassessment of capital adequacy. These stress m easures must be compared against the measure of \\nEPE and considered by the institution as part of its internal capital adequacy assessment process. Stress testing must also involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavourable effects on a firm’s credit exposures and assessment of the firm’s ability to withstand such changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are; (i) economic or industry downturns, (ii) market -place events, or (iii) decreased liquid ity conditions. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.45]  \\n 63. Institutions must have a comprehensive stress testing program for counterparty credit \\nrisk. The stress testing program must include the following elements:  \\n \\n13  This section draws heavily on the Counterparty Risk Manageme nt Policy Group’s paper, Improving Counterparty Risk \\nManagement Practices  (June 1999)  \\n\\n\\n## Page 24\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 24 • institutions must ensure complete trade capture and exposure aggregation across all \\nforms of counterparty credit risk (not just OTC derivatives) at the counterparty- specific \\nlevel in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing; \\n• for all counterparties, institutions should produce, at least monthly, exposure stress testing of principal market risk factors (e.g. interest rates, FX, equities, credit spreads, and commodity prices) in order to proactively identify, and when necessary, reduce outsized concentrations to specific directional sensiti vities;  \\n• institutions should apply multi -factor stress testing scenarios and assess material non -\\ndirectional risks (i.e. , yield curve exposure, basis risks, etc.) at least quarterly. Multiple -\\nfactor stress tests should, at a minimum, aim to address scenario s in which a) severe \\neconomic or market events have occurred; b) broad market liquidity has decreased significantly; and c) the market impact of liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary. These stress tests may be part of institution -wide str ess testing;  \\n• stressed market movements have an impact not only on counterparty exposures, but \\nalso on the credit quality of counterparties. At least quarterly, institutions should \\nconduct stress testing applying stressed conditions to the joint movement of  exposures \\nand counterparty creditworthiness;  \\n• exposure stress testing (including single factor, multifactor and material non- directional \\nrisks) and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness should be performed at the counterparty- specific, counterparty group (e.g. industry and region), and aggregate \\ninstitution -wide CCR levels;  \\n• stress tests results should be integrated into regular reporting to senior management. The analysis should capture the largest counterparty- level impacts across the portfolio,  \\nmaterial concentrations within segments of the portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and counterparty specific trends;  \\n• the severity of factor shocks should be consistent with the purpose of the stress test. When evaluating  solvency under stress, factor shocks should be severe enough to \\ncapture historical extreme market environments and/or extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The impact of such shocks on capital resources should be evaluated, as well as the impa ct on capital requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day- to-\\nday portfolio monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations, institutions should also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability;  \\n• institutions should consider reve rse stress tests to identify extreme, but plausible, \\nscenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes;  \\n• senior management must take a lead role in the integration of stress testing into the risk management framework and risk culture of the instit ution and ensure that the results \\nare meaningful and proactively used to manage counterparty credit risk. At a minimum, the results of stress testing for significant exposures should be compared to guidelines that express the institution’s risk appetite an d elevated for discussion and action when \\nexcessive or concentrated risks are present.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.46]  \\n \\n\\n\\n## Page 25\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 25 Wrong- way risk  \\n \\n64. Institutions must identify exposures that give rise to a greater degree of general wrong -\\nway risk. Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify risk factors that are positively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness. Such testi ng needs to address the \\npossibility of severe shocks occurring when relationships between risk factors have changed. \\nInstitutions should monitor general wrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by \\nother categories that are germane to the busin ess. Reports should be provided to senior \\nmanagement on a regular basis that communicate wrong way risks and the steps that are being taken to manage that risk.  [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.47]  \\n 65. An institution is exposed to “specific wrong- way risk” (SWWR) if  future exposure to a \\nspecific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. For example, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong -way exposures for the \\nbuyer that is specific to the counterparty. An institution must have procedures in place to identify, monitor and control cases of SWWR, beginning at the inception of a trade and continuing through the life of the trade. To calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same netting set as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single -name credit de fault swaps \\nwhere there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals the full expected loss in the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the underlying issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the underlying instrument allows the institution to recogni ze, in respect of such swap, the market \\nvalue that has been lost a lready and any expected recoveries. Accordingly LGD for Advanced or \\nFoundation IRB institutions must be set to 100% for such swap transactions .\\n14 For institutions \\nusing the s tandardi zed approach for credit risk, the risk weight to use is that of an unsecured \\ntransaction. For equity derivatives, bond options, securities financing transactions etc. referencing a single company where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty and the underlying company, and where SWWR has been identified, EAD equals the value of the transaction under the assumption of a jump- to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this \\nmakes re- use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC)  that already contain an \\nLGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%. LGD for Advanced and Foundation IRB banks will be that of an unsecured exposure. For institutions using the s tandardized a pproach for credit \\nrisk, the risk weight of an unsecured transac tion should be used.  \\n \\nThe counterparty credit risk arising from trades where SWWR has been identified can be \\nmitigated through either prepayment or the collection of independent collateral amounts.

The capital \\nrequirements for such underlying exposure are to be calculated without reduction for the swap which introduces \\nwrong way risk.

An institution is exposed to “specific right -way risk” (SRWR) if the future exposure to a \\nspecific counterparty is highly inversely correlated with the counterparty’s probability of default. An example of SRWR are warrants, which can be a component of  call spread \\noverlay trades written  by the counterparty on the counterparty’s stock.   \\n67. There are transactions where SRWR is present and, given the structure of these, \\ninstitutions will have a zero EAD to the counterparty if the counterparty defaults.   \\n68. Where an institution has identified SRWR, only the trade types identified in paragraph \\n69 below, and subject to due diligence ,\\n15 are permitted to receive a zero EAD. Institutions \\nwishing to add other trade types should contact OSFI’s Ca pital Division for prior permission.  \\n69. Permitted trade types include: \\n• An equity warrant , or option in each case written by the counterparty on the \\ncounterparty’s own stock  purchased as part of a call spread overlay transaction, where \\na bond hedge has also be en purchased. Call spread overlay transactions involve a \\ncounterparty issuing convertible bonds and wishing to synthetically increase the \\nconversion price.  \\n• Issuer forward as well as issuer r ange forward sales of equity whereby the institution \\nhas also simu ltaneously shorted the shares of the counterparty. Issuer and issuer range \\nforward sales of equity are typically done by a counterparty, with future capital expenditures or other funding needs, wishing to lock in a favourable current stock price or range of stock prices  without needing to issue shares until the maturity of the \\nforward or range forward transaction.  \\n• Accelerated share repurchase agreements whereby counterparties provide an \\ninstitution with funds to buy back shares in a defined peri od of time (typically under \\nsix months). \\n \\n15 Trade types listed in paragraph 69 do not automatically qualify for a zero EAD.

Other operational requirements focus on the internal controls needed to ensure the \\nintegrity of model inputs; specifically, the requirements address the transaction data, historical \\nmarket data, frequency of calculation, and valuation models used in measuring EPE. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.49]  \\n \\n71. The internal model must reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely, \\ncomplete, and conservative fashion. Such terms include, but a re not limited to, contract notional \\namounts, maturity, reference assets, collateral thresholds, margining arrangements, netting arrangements, etc. The terms and specifications must reside in a secure database that is subject to formal and periodic audit. The process for recogni zing netting arrangements must require signoff \\nby legal staff to verify the legal enforceability of netting and be input into the database by an independent unit. The transmission of transaction terms and specifications data to the i nternal \\nmodel must also be subject to internal audit and formal reconciliation processes must be in place between the internal model and source data systems to verify on an ongoing basis that transaction terms and specifications are being reflected in EPE correctly or at least conservatively. [ Basel Framework, CRE 53.50]  \\n 72. When  the Effective EPE model is calibrated using historic market data, the institution \\nmust employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least three years of historical d ata must be used to estimate parameters of the model. Alternatively, market implied \\ndata may be used to estimate parameters of the model. In all cases, the data must be updated quarterly or more frequently if market conditions warrant. To calculate the Eff ective EPE using a \\nstress calibration, the institution must also calibrate Effective EPE using three years of data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of an institution’s counterparties or calibrate Effective EPE using market implied data from a suitable period of stress. The following process will be used to assess the adequacy of the stress calibration:  \\n• The institution must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period coincides with a period of increased CDS or other credit spreads – such as loan or corporate bond spreads \\n– for a representative selection of the institution’s counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the institution does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, the institution should map each counterparty to specific credit spread data based on region, internal rating and business types. \\n• The exposure model for all counterparties must use data, either historic or implied, that includes the data from the stressed credit period, and must use such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration of the Effective EPE model to current data.  \\n [Basel Framework, CRE 53.52]  \\n 73. When two different calibration methods are used for different parameters within the \\nEffective EPE model, OSFI expects institutions’ model development and validation groups to provide documented justification for the choice of calibration methods that includes an assessment of the resulting model risk.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 28\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 28  \\n74. If an institution wished to recogni ze in its EAD calculations for OTC derivatives the \\neffect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, then it must model collateral jointly with the exposure. If the institution is not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure then it must use either haircuts that meet the standards of the financial collateral \\ncomprehensive method with own haircut estimates or the standard supervisory haircuts. [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.52]  \\n \\n75. If the internal model includes the effect of collateral on changes in the market value of \\nthe netting set, the institution must model collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself jointly wi th the exposure in its EAD calculations for securities -financing \\ntransactions. [Basel Framework, CRE 53.53]  \\n 76. The EPE model (and modifications made to it) must be subject to an internal model \\nvalidation process. The process must be clearly articulated in fi rms’ policies and procedures. The \\nvalidation process must specify the kind of testing needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which assumptions are violated and may result in an understatement of EPE. The validation process must incl ude a review of the comprehensiveness of the EPE model, for \\nexample such as whether the EPE model covers all products that have a material contribution to counterparty risk exposures.

The use of an internal model to estimate E PE, and hence the exposure amount or EAD, \\nof positions subject to a CCR capital charge will be conditional upon the explicit OSFI approval.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 53.55]  \\n \\n78. The BCBS has issued guidance regarding the use of internal models to estimate certain \\nparameters of risk and determine minimum capital charges against those risks. OSFI requires that institutions seeking to make use of internal models to estimate EPE meet similar requirements regarding, for example, the integrity of the risk managem ent system, the skills of staff that will \\nrely on such measures in operational areas and in control functions, the accuracy of models, and the rigour of internal controls over relevant internal processes. As an example, institutions seeking to make use of an internal model to estimate EPE must demonstrate that they meet the \\nCommittee’s general criteria for institutions seeking to make use of internal models to assess market risk exposures, but in the context of assessing counterparty credit risk.\\n16 [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 53.56]  \\n 79.

For capital adequacy purposes, institutions may net transactions (e.g., when determining \\nthe RC component of a netting set) subject to novation under which any obligation between an institution and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for th e same currency and value date, legally substituting \\none single amount for the previous gross obligations.

An example of such an instance would be Specific Wrong Way Risk (WWR) transac tions which are \\nrequired to each be moved to their own standalone netting set.   \\n21  The netting contract must not contain any clause which, in the event of default of a counterparty, permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make limited payments only, or n o payments at all, to the estate of the defaulting \\nparty, even if the defaulting party is a net creditor.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 33\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 33 • The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the \\nforeign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;  \\n• The law that governs the individual transactions; and  \\n• The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to affect the netting. \\nOSFI, after consultation when necessary with other relevant supervisors, must be satisfied that the netting is enforceable under the laws of each of the relev ant \\njurisdictions .\\n22 \\n(iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting arrangements are kept under review in light of the possible changes in relevant law.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.7]  \\n 104. There are two formulations of replacement cost de pending on whether the trades with a \\ncounterparty are subject to a margin agreement. Where a margin agreement exists, the formulation could apply both to bilateral transactions and central clearing relationships. The formulation also addresses the various arrangements that an institution may have to post and/or receive collateral that may be referred to as initial margin. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.9]  \\n A. Formulation for unmargined transactions  \\n 105. For unmargined transactions (that is, where VM is not exchanged, but collateral other \\nthan VM may be present), RC is defined as the greater of: (i) the current market value of the derivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by the institution (if any ), and (ii) zero. This is \\nconsistent with the use of replacement cost as the measure of current exposure, meaning that when the institution owes the counterparty money it has no exposure to the counterparty if it can instantly replace its trades and sell c ollateral at current market prices. Mathematically:   \\n RC = max{ V-C,0} \\nwhere V is the value of the derivative transactions in the netting set and C is the haircut value of net collateral held, which is calculated in accordance with the NICA methodology defined in paragraph 112. For this purpose , the value of non- cash collateral posted by the institution to its \\ncounterparty is increased and the value of the non- cash collateral received by the institution from \\nits counterparty is decreased using haircuts (which are the same as those that apply to repo -style \\ntransactions) for the time periods described in paragraph 100.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.10 and 52.11]  \\n 106. In the above formulation, it is assumed that the replacement cost representing today’s \\nexposure to the counterparty cannot go less than zero. However, institutions sometimes hold excess collateral (even in the absence of a margin agreement) or have out -of-the-money trades \\nwhich can further protect the institution from the increase of the exposure. As discussed in paragraphs 116 to 118, the SA -CCR would allow such over -collaterali zation and negative mark-\\n \\n22  Thus, if any of these supervisors is dissatisfied about enforceability under its laws, the netting contract or \\nagreement will not meet this condition and neither counterparty could obtain supervisory benefit.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 34\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 34 to market value to reduce PFE, but would not affect replacement cost .

Bilateral transactions with a one -way margining agreement in favour of the institution’s \\ncounterparty (that is, where an institution posts, but does not collect, collateral) must be treated \\nas unmargined transactions. [ Basel Framewor k, CRE 52.10, FAQ #1]  \\n \\nB. Formulation for margined transactions  \\n 108. The RC formula for margined transactions builds on the RC formula for unmargined \\ntransactions. It also employs concepts used in standard margining agreements, as discussed more fully below. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.13]  \\n 109. The RC for margined transactions in the SA -CCR is defined as the greatest exposure \\nthat would not trigger a call for VM, taking into account the mechanics of collateral exchanges in margining agreements. Such mechanics include, for example, “Threshold”, “Minimum Transfer Amount” and “Independent Amount” in the standard industry documentation,\\n23 which are \\nfactored into a call for VM .24 [Basel Framework, CRE 52.14]  \\n C. Incorporating NICA into replacement cost  \\n 110. One objective of the SA -CCR is to more fully reflect the effect of margining agreements \\nand the associated exchange of collateral in the calculation of CCR exposures. The following paragraphs address how the exchange of collateral is incorporated into the SA -CCR. [ Basel \\nFramew ork, CRE 52.15]  \\n 111. To avoid confusion surrounding the use of terms initial margin and independent amount \\nwhich are used in various contexts and sometimes interchangeably, the term independent collateral amount (ICA) is introduced. ICA represents (i) collater al (other than VM) posted by \\nthe counterparty that the institution may seize upon default of the counterparty, the amount of which does not change in response to the value of the transactions it secures and/or (ii) the Independent Amount  (IA) parameter as defined in standard industry documentation. ICA can \\nchange in response to factors such as the value of the collateral or a change in the number of transactions in the netting set. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.16]  \\n 112. Because both an institution and its counterpar ty may be required to post ICA, it is \\nnecessary to introduce a companion term, net independent collateral amount ( NICA ), to describe \\nthe amount of collateral that an institution may use to offset its exposure on the default of the \\n \\n23  For example, the 1992 (Multicurrency- Cross Border) Master Agreement and the 2002 Master Agreement \\npublished by the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc.

NICA does not include collateral that an institution has posted to a segregated, \\nbankruptcy remote account, which presumably would be returned upon the bankruptcy of the counterparty. That is, NICA represents any collateral (segregated or unsegregated) posted by the counterparty less the unsegregated collateral posted by the institution. With respect to IA, NICA takes into account the differential of IA required for the institution minus IA required for the \\ncounterparty. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.17]  \\n \\n113. For margined trad es, the replacement cost is:  \\nRC = max{ V – C; TH + MTA – NICA;0}  \\nWhere: V and C are defined as in the unmargined formulation, except that C now includes the \\nnet variation margin amount, where the amount received by the institution is accounted with a posit ive sign and the amount posted by the institution is accounted with a negative sign, TH is \\nthe positive threshold before the counterparty must send the institution collateral, and MTA is \\nthe minimum transfer amount applicable to the counterparty. [ Basel Fr amework, CRE 52.18]  \\n 114. TH + MTA – NICA represents the largest exposure that would not trigger a VM call and \\nit contains levels of collateral that need always to be maintained. For example, without initial margin or IA, the greatest exposure that would not trigger a variation margin call is the threshold plus any minimum transfer amount. In the adapted formulation, NICA is subtracted from TH + MTA . This makes the calculation more accurate by fully reflecting both the actual level of \\nexposure that would not trigger a margin call and the effect of collateral held and/or posted by an \\ninstitution. The calculation is floored at zero, recogni zing that the institution may hold NICA in \\nexcess of TH + MTA , which could otherwise result in a negative replacement cost. [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 52.19]  \\n7.1.7.2 PFE Add -ons \\n115. The PFE add -on consists of (i) an aggregate add- on component, which consists of add-\\nons calculated for each asset class and (ii) a multiplier that allows for the recognition of excess collateral or negative mark -to-market value for the transactions . Mathematically:  \\nPFE = multiplier ×  AddOn\\naggregate \\n \\nWhere AddOnaggregate is the aggregate add -on component and multiplier is defined as a \\nfunction of three inputs: V, C and AddOnaggregate. \\n The paragraphs below describe the inputs that enter into the calculation of the add- on formulas in \\nmore detail, and set out the formula fo r each asset class.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.20]  \\n \\n7.1.7.3 Recognition of excess collateral and negative mark -to-market  \\n116. As a general principle, over -collaterali zation should reduce capital requirements for \\ncounterparty credit risk. In fact, many institutions hold excess collateral (i.e. , collateral greater \\nthan the net market value of the derivatives contracts) precisely to offset potential increases in \\n\\n\\n## Page 36\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 36 exposure represented by the add- on. As discussed in paragraphs 105 and 113, collateral may \\nreduce the replacement cost component of th e exposure under the SA -CCR. The PFE component \\nalso reflects the risk -reducing property of excess collateral. [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.21]  \\n117. For prudential reasons and in line with Basel Committee direction, OSFI applied a \\nmultiplier to the PFE component tha t decreases as excess collateral increases, without reaching \\nzero (the multiplier is floored at 5% of the PFE add -on). When the collateral held is less than the \\nnet market value of the derivative contracts (“under -collaterali zation”), the current replacement \\ncost is positive and the multiplier is equal to one (i.e. the PFE component is equal to the full \\nvalue of the aggregate add -on). Where the collateral held is greater than the net market value of \\nthe derivative contracts (“over -collaterali zation”), the current replacement cost is zero and the \\nmultiplier is less than one (i.e. the PFE component is less than the full value of the aggregate add-on). [ Basel Framework, CRE 52.22]  \\n118. This multiplier will also be activated when the current value of the derivative \\ntransactions is negative. This is because out -of-the-money transactions do not currently represent \\nan exposure and have less chance to go in- the-money.

The designation of a derivative transaction to an asset class is be made on the basis of \\nits primary risk driver. Most derivative transaction s have one primary risk driver, defined by its \\nreference underlying instrument (e.g., an interest rate curve for an interest rate swap, a reference entity for a credit default swap, a foreign exchange rate for a FX call option, etc). When this \\nprimary risk  driver is clearly identifiable, the transaction will fall into one of the asset classes \\ndescribed above.

For more complex trades that may have more than one risk driver (e.g., multi- asset or \\nhybrid derivatives), institutions m ust take sensitivities and volatility of the underlying into \\naccount for determining the primary risk driver.   \\nOSFI may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more than one asset class, \\nresulting in the same position being included in multiple  classes. In this case, for each asset class \\nto which the position is allocated, institutions must determine appropriately the sign and delta \\nadjustment of the relevant risk driver.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.27 and 52.28]  \\n \\n7.1.7.6 General steps for calculating the add- on \\n \\n122. For each transaction, the primary risk factor or factors need to be determined and \\nattributed to one or more of the five asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity or commodity. The add- on for each asset class is calculated usin g asset -class -specific formulas \\nthat represent a styli zed Effective EPE calculation under the assumption that all trades in the \\nasset class have zero current mark -to-market value (i.e. they are at -the-money). [ Basel \\nFramework, CRE 52.29]  \\n123. Although the add -on formulas are asset class -specific, they have a number of features in \\ncommon. To determine the add- on, transactions in each asset class are subject to adjustment in \\nthe following general steps:  \\n1) The effective notional (D) must be calculated for each derivative (i.e. each individual trade) in the netting set. The effective notional is a measure of the sensitivity of the trade to movements in the underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates, exchange rates, credit spreads, e quity prices and commodity prices). The effective notional is calculated as the \\nproduct of the following parameters (i.e. D = d ×  MF ×  δ): \\na. The adjustment notional (d) . The adjusted notional is a measure of the size of \\nthe trade. For derivatives in the fore ign exchange asset class this is simply the \\nnotional value of the foreign currency leg of the derivative contracted, converted to the domestic currency. For derivatives in the equity and commodity asset classes, it is simply the current price of the releva nt share or unit of commodity \\nmultiplied by the number of shares/units that the derivative references. For derivatives in the interest rate and credit asset classes, the notional amount is adjusted by a measure of the duration of the instrument to account for the fact that the value of the instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to movements in underlying risk factors (i.e. interest rates and credit spreads).  \\nb. The maturity factor (MF). The maturity factor is a parameter that takes account of the  time period over which the potential future exposure is calculated. The \\ncalculation of the maturity factor varies depending on whether the netting set is margined or unmargined.  \\nc. The supervisory delta (δ). The supervisory delta ensures the effective notional takes into account the direction of the trade, i.e. whether the trade is long or short, by having a positive or negative sign. It is also takes into account whether the \\n\\n\\n## Page 38', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 2, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199758', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 38\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 38 trade has a non -linear relationship with the underlying risk factor (which is the \\ncase for options and collateralized debt obligation tranches).  \\n2) A supervisory factor (SF)  is identified for each individual trade in the netting set.

The purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where long and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the potential future exposure. \\n4) Aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory \\nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset -class level to give \\nthe asset class level add -on. The method of aggregation varies between assets classes and \\nfor credit, equity and commodity derivatives.

This time period appears in the maturity factor defined in paragraphs 139 to 144 that scales down adjusted notional for unmargine d trades for all asset classes. If a derivative contract has another derivative \\ncontract as its underlying (for example, a swaption) and may be physically exercised into the underlying contract (i.e., an institution would assume a position in the underlying contract in the event of exercise), then maturity of the contract is the time period until the final settlement date of the underlying derivative contract.  \\n• For interest rate and credit derivatives,  S\\ni is the period of time (starting today) until the \\nstart of the time period referenced by an interest rate or credit contract.

In many cases the trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity. Wh en \\nthis is not the case, institutions must use the following rules to determine the trade notional amount. \\n• Where the notional is a formula of market values, the institution must enter the current \\nmarket values to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a ll interest rate and credit derivatives with variable notional amounts specified in the \\ncontract (such as amorti zing and accreting swaps), institutions must use the average \\nnotional over the remaining life of the swap as the trade notional amount. The aver age \\nshould be calculated as “time weighted”. The averaging described in this paragraph does \\nnot cover transactions where the notional varies due to price changes (typically FX, \\nequity and commodity derivatives).  \\n• Leveraged swaps must be converted to the not ional of the equivalent unleveraged swap, \\nthat is, where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor, the stated notional must be multiplied by the factor on the interest rates to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the notional is multiplied by the number of exchanges of principal in the derivative contract to determine the trade notional amount.  \\n• For a derivative contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the fair value of the contract is zero, the \\nremaining maturity equals the time until the next reset date.  \\n \\n26  There is a distinction between the time period of the underlying transaction and the remaining maturity of the \\nderivative contract.

The size of the position in the collar components must be such \\nthat the digital payoff is reproduced exactly outside of the region between the two strikes. \\nThe effective notional is then computed for the bought and sold European components of the collar separately, using the option formulas for the supervisory delta in paragraph 132 \\n(the exercise date \\niT and the current value of the underlying iP of the digital option must \\nbe used). The absolute value of the digital option effective notional must be capped by the \\nratio of the digital payoff to the relevant supervisory factor. \\n• If a trade’s payoff can be represented as a combination of European option payoffs (e.g. collar, butterfly/calendar spread, straddle, strangle, etc.), each European option component must be treated as a separate trade.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.42] \\n \\n• \\nFor the purposes of effective notional calculations, multi -payment options must be represented \\nas a combination of single-payment options.

The calibration of the supervisory factors for equity derivatives rely on estimates of the \\nmarket volatility of equity indices, with the application of a conservative beta factor38 to translate \\nthis estimate into an estimate of individual volatilities.[Basel Framework, CRE 52.67]  \\n158.  Institutions are not permitted to make any modelling assumptions in the calculation of \\nthe PFE add -ons, including estimating individual volatiliti es or taking publicly available \\nestimates of beta. This is a pragmatic approach to ensure a consistent implementation across \\njurisdictions but also to keep the add -on calculation relatively simple and prudent. Therefore, \\nonly two values of supervisory fact ors have been defined for equity derivatives, one for single \\nentities and one for indices.  \\n \\n38 The beta of an individual equity measures the volatility of the stock relative to a broad market index. A value of \\nbeta greater than one means the individual equity is more volatile than the index. The greater the beta is, the \\nmore volatile the stock. The beta is calculated by running a linear regression of the stock on the broad index.   \\n\\n\\n## Page 52\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 52  [Basel Framework, CRE52.68]  \\n7.1.7.18  Add-on for commodity derivatives  \\n159. The calculation  of the add -on for the commodity derivative asset class is similar to the \\ncalculation of the add -on for the credit and equity derivative asset classes. It recognizes the full \\noffsetting of long and short positions for derivatives that reference the same type of underlying \\ncommodity. It also allows partial offsetting between derivatives that reference different types of \\ncommodity, however, this partial offsetting is only permitted within each of the four hedging sets \\nof the commodity derivative asset class, where the different commodity types are more likely to demonstrate some stable, meaningful joint dynamics. Offsetting between hedging sets is not recogni zed (e.g. a forward contract on crude oil cannot hedge a forward contract on corn). [Basel \\nframework, C RE 52.69]  \\n160. The add -on for the commodity derivative asset class (AddOn\\nCommodity) within a netting \\nset is calculated using the following steps:  \\n(1) Step 1: Calculate the effective notional for each trade in the netting set that is in the commodity derivative asset class. This is calculated as the product of the following three terms: (i) the adjusted notional of the trade (d); (ii) the supervisory delta adjustment of \\nthe trade ( δ); and (iii) the maturity factor (MF). That is, for each trade i, D\\ni = d i × δi × \\nMF i. \\n(2) Step 2: Allocate the trades in the commodity derivative asset class to hedging sets. In the \\ncommodity derivative asset class there are four hedging sets consisting of derivatives that reference: energy, metals, agriculture and other commodit ies. \\n(3) Step 3: Calculate the combined effective notional for all derivatives within each hedging set that reference the same commodity type (e.g. , all derivatives that reference copper \\nwithin the metals hedging set). The combined effective notional of the co mmodity type \\n(EN\\nComType ) is calculated by adding together the trade level effective notionals calculated \\nin step 1 that reference the commodity type. \\n(4) Step 4: Calculate the add -on for each commodity type (AddOn ComType ) within each \\nhedging set by multiplying the combined effective notional for that commodity calculated in step 3 by the supervisory factor that is specified for that commodity type (SF\\nComType ). \\nThe supervisory factors are set out in Table 2 in paragraph 162 and are set to 40% for \\nelectricity derivatives and 18% for derivatives that reference all other types of \\ncommodities.  \\n(5) Step 5: Calculate the add -on for each of the four commodi ty hedging sets (AddOn HS) by \\nusing the formula that follows. In the formula the summations are across all commodity \\ntypes within the hedging set, AddOn ComType  is the add -on amount calculated in step 4 for \\neach commodity type and ρ ComType  is the supervisory prescribed correlation factor \\ncorresponding to the commodity type.

Regarding the calculation steps above, defining individual commodity types is \\noperationally difficult. In fact, it is impossible to  fully specify all relevant distinctions between \\ncommodity types so that all basis risk is captured. For example crude oil could be a commodity \\ntype within the energy hedging set, but in certain cases this definition could omit a substantial \\nbasis risk bet ween different types of crude oil (West Texas Intermediate, Brent, Saudi Light, etc). \\nAlso, the four commodity type hedging sets have been defined without regard to characteristics \\nsuch as location and quality. For example, the energy hedging set contains commodity types such \\nas crude oil, electricity, natural gas and coal.

If multiple margin agreements apply to a single netting set, (for example: one Credit \\nSupport Annex [CSA] for VM and one for Initial Margin [IM]), all collateral collected against the netting set in question can be used to offset exposures as if it were collected in a single netting set, provided the institution has performed sufficient legal review to ensure the requirements of paragraph 103 are satisfied.  \\nWhen multiple CSAs apply to an individual netting set, the RC and PFE are calculated as follows:  \\nRC \\n• The V and C terms should consider all transactions within a netting set, across all CSAs; and \\n• The TH + MTA - NICA is the sum of the thresholds and MTAs across all CSA \\nagreement.  \\n \\nPFE \\n• In the multiplier term, similarly to RC, the V and C terms should consider all transactions  \\nin the netting set across all CSA agreements; and  \\n• The margin period of risk applied to calculate effective notionals is specific to the individual CSA to which a trade belongs. \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 52.74] \\n\\n\\n## Page 55\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 55  \\n166. If a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets, special treatment is \\nnecessary because it is problematic to allocate the common collateral to individual netting sets. The replacement cost at any given time is determined by the sum of two terms. The first term is equal to the unmargined current exposure of the institution to the counterparty aggregated across \\nall netting sets within the margin agreement reduced by the positive current net collateral (i.e. \\ncollateral is subtracted only when the institution is a net holder of collatera l). The second term is \\nnon-zero only when the institution is a net poster of collateral: it is equal to the current net posted \\ncollateral (if there is any) reduced by the unmargined current exposure of the counterparty to the \\ninstitution aggregated across all netting sets within the margin agreement. Net collateral available to the institution should include both VM and NICA. Mathematically, RC for the entire margin agreement is: \\n𝑀𝑀𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴=𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚��𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚{𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆;0}−𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚{𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴;0};0\\n𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴�+𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚��𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚{𝑉𝑉𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆;0}−𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚{𝑅𝑅𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴;0};0\\n𝑁𝑁𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴� \\nwhere the summation 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆∈𝑀𝑀𝐴𝐴is across the netting sets covered by the margin agreement \\n(hence the notation), V NS is the current mark -to-market value of the netting set NS and C MA is the \\ncash equivalent value of all currently avail able collateral under the margin agreement.  \\n[Basel Framework 52.75]  \\n 167. Where a single margin agreement applies to several netting sets as described in \\nparagraph 166, collateral will be exchanged based on mark -to-market values that are netted \\nacross all transactions covered under the margin agreement, irrespective of netting sets. That is, collateral exch anged on a net basis may not be sufficient to cover PFE.  \\nIn this situation, therefore, the PFE add -on must be calculated according to the unmargined \\nmethodology. Netting set -level PFEs are then aggregated.

Netting sets with positive market values must first be allocated collateral up to the amount of those market values. Only after all positi ve market values have been compensated may surplus \\ncollateral be attributed freely among all netting sets.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 56\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 56 • If the institution is a net provider of collateral (C<0), all of the individual amounts \\nallocated to the individual netting sets must also be negativ e or zero. Netting sets with \\nnegative market values must first be allocated collateral up to the amount of their market values. If the collateral provided is larger than the sum of the negative market values, then all multipliers must be set equal to 1 and  no allocation is necessary.  \\n• The allocated parts must add up to the total collateral available for the margin agreement.  \\n Apart from these limitations, institutions may allocate available collateral at their discretion. The multiplier is then calculated pe r netting set according to paragraph 118 taking the allocated \\namount of collateral into account.  \\n[Basel Framework 52.76]  \\n168. Eligible collateral which is taken outside a netting set, but is available to a bank to offset \\nlosses due to counterparty default on one netting set only, should be treated as an independent collateral amount associated with the netting set and used within  the calculation of replacement \\ncost in paragraph 105 when the netting set is unmargined and in paragraph 113 when the netting \\nset is margined. Eligible collateral which is taken outside a netting set, and is available to a bank to offset losses due to counterparty default on more than one nett ing set, should be treated as \\ncollateral taken under a margin agreement applicable to multiple netting sets, in which case the treatment in paragraphs 166 and 167 applies.

The risk weight applied to collateral posted to the CCP by the institution must be determined in accordance with paragraphs 185 to 188. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.7]  \\n176. The exposure amount for such trade exposur e is to be calculated in accordance with this \\nchapter using the IMM or the SACCR, as consistently applied by such an institution to such an exposure in the ordinary course of its business, or Chapter 4 for collaterali zed transactions.

The two conditions referenced in paragraph 181 above are:  \\n(1) The offsetting transactions are identified by the CCP as client transactions and collateral \\nto support them is held by the CCP and/or the clearing member, as applicable, under arrangements that prevent any losses to the client due to: (a) the default or insolvency of the clearing member;  (b) the default or insolvency of the clearing member’s other clients; \\nand (c) the joint default or insolvency of the clearing member and any of its other clients. Regarding the condition set out in this paragraph:  \\na. Upon the insolvency of the clearing member, there must be no legal impediment (other than the need to obtain a court order to which the client is entitled) to the transfer of the collateral belonging to clients of a defaulting clearing member to the CCP, t o one or more other surviving clearing members or to the client or the \\nclient’s nominee.  \\nb. The client must have conducted a sufficient legal review (and undertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability) and have a well founded basis to conclude that, in the event of legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find that such arrangements mentioned above would be legal, valid, binding and enforceable under the relevant laws of the relevant jurisdictio n(s). \\n(2) Relevant laws, regulation, rules, contractual, or administrative arrangements provide that the offsetting transactions with the defaulted or insolvent clearing member are highly likely to continue to be indirectly transacted through the CCP, or by the CCP, if the clearing member defaults or becomes insolvent. In such circumstances, the client \\npositions and collateral with the CCP will be transferred at market value unless the client requests to close out the position at market value. Regarding the condition set out in this paragraph, if there is a clear precedent for transactions being ported at a CCP and industry intent for this practice to continue, then these factors must be considered when assessing if trades are highly likely to be ported. The fac t that CCP documentation does \\nnot prohibit client trades from being ported is not sufficient to say they are highly likely to be ported.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.15]  \\n 183. Where a client is not protected from losses in the case that the clearing member and \\nanother client of the clearing member jointly default or become jointly insolvent, but all other \\nconditions in the preceding paragraph are met, a risk weight of 4% will apply to the client’s exposure to the clearing member, or to the higher level client, respe ctively.

The counterparty credit risk requirements arise where assets or collateral \\nof a clearing member or client are posted with a CCP or a clearing member and are not held in a \\nbankruptcy r emote manner.

Where such collateral is included in the definition of trade exposures and the entity \\nholding the collateral is the CCP, the following risk weights apply where the assets or collateral is not hel d on a bankruptcy- remote basis:  \\n(1) For institutions that are clearing members a risk -weight of 2% applies. \\n(2) For institutions that are clients of clearing members: \\na) A 2% risk weight applies if the conditions in paragraph 181 and 182 are met; or  \\nb) A 4% risk weight applied if the conditions in paragraph 183 are met  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.20]  \\n188. Where such collateral is included in the definition of trades exposures, there is no \\ncapital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposures if the col lateral is: (a) held by a \\ncustodian;\\n44 and (b) bankruptcy remote from the CCP. Regarding this paragraph, all forms of \\ncollateral are included, such as: cash, securities, other pledged assets, and excess initial or variation margin, also called overcollater alization, that is held by a custodian, and is bankruptcy \\nremote from the CCP, is not subject to a capital requirement for counterparty credit risk exposure \\n \\n43  Collateral posted must receive the banking book or trading book treatment it would receive if it had not been \\nposted to the CCP. In addition, this collateral is subject to the CCR framework of the Basel rules, regardless of \\nwhether it is in th e banking or trading book. This includes the increase due to haircuts under either the \\nstandardized supervisory haircuts or the own estimates.   \\n44  In this paragraph, the word “custodian” may include a trustee, agent, pledgee, secured creditor or any other  \\nperson that holds property in a way that does not give such person a beneficial interest in such property and will not result in such property being subject to legally -enforceable claims by such persons creditors, or to a court -\\nordered stay of the return of such property, if such person becomes insolvent or bankrupt.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 62\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 62 to such bankruptcy remote custodian (i.e. the related risk weight or EAD is equal to zero). [Basel \\nFramework, CRE 54.21]  \\n189. The relevant risk weight of the CCP will apply to assets or collateral posted by a bank \\nthat do not meet the definition of trade exposures (for example, treating the exposure as a financial institution under the s tandardized a pproach or i nternal r atings -based a pproach to credit \\nrisk).  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.22]  \\n190. Regarding the calculation of the exposure, or EAD, where banks use the SA -CCR to \\ncalculate exposures, collateral posted which is not held in a bankruptcy remote manner must be accounted for in the net independent collateral amount term in accordance with paragraph 110 to 114. For banks using IM M models, the alpha multiplier must be applied to the exposure on \\nposted collateral. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.23]  \\n B. Default fund exposures  \\n 191. Where a default fund is shared between products or types of business with settlement \\nrisk only (e.g., equities and bonds) and products or types of business which give rise to counterparty credit risk (i.e., OTC derivatives, exchange -traded derivatives, SFTs or long \\nsettlement transactions), all of the default fund contributions will receive the risk weigh t \\ndetermined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below, without apportioning to different classes or types of business or products. However, where the default fund contributions from clearing members are segregated by product types and only accessible for specific product types, the capital requirements for those default fund exposures determined according to the formulae and methodology set forth below must be calculated for each specific product giving rise to counterparty credit risk. In case the CCP’s prefunded own resources are shared among \\nproduct types, the CCP will have to allocate those funds to each of the calculations, in proportion to the respective product specific EAD.  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.24]  \\n192. Whenever an institution is required to capitalize for exposures arising from default fund \\ncontributions to a QCCP, clearing member institutions will apply the following approach. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.25]  \\n193. Clearing member institutions will apply a risk weight to their default fund con tributions \\ndetermined according to a risk sensitive formula that considers (i) the size and quality of a qualifying CCP’s financial resources, (ii) the counterparty credit risk exposures of such CCP, and (iii) the application of such financial resources vi a the CCP’s loss bearing waterfall, in the \\ncase of one or more clearing member defaults. The clearing member institution’s risk sensitive \\ncapital requirement for its default fund contribution ( 𝐾𝐾\\n𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖) must be calculated using the \\nformulae and methodology set forth below. This calculation may be performed by a CCP, \\ninstitution, supervisor or other body with access to the required data, as long as the conditions in paragraphs 204 to 206 are met.  [Basel Framework, CRE 54.26]  \\n194. The clearing member bank’s risk- sensitive capital requirement for its defaul t fund \\ncontribution (K\\nCMi) is calculated in two steps:  \\n\\n\\n## Page 63\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 63 1) Calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP due to its counterparty credit \\nrisk exposures to all of its clearing members and their clients.  \\n2) Calculate the capital requirement for the clearing member institution.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.27]  \\nHypothetical Capital Requirement of the CCP  \\n195. The first step in calculating the clearing member institution’s capital requirement for its \\ndefault fund contribution is to calculate the hypothetical capital requirement of the CCP (K\\nCCP) due to its count erparty credit risk exposures to all of its clearing members and their \\nclients. K CCP is a hypothetical capital requirement for a CCP, calculated on a consistent basis \\nfor the sole purpose of determining the capitalization of clearing member default fund contributions; it does not represent the actual capital requirements for a CCP which may be \\ndetermine by a CCP and its supervisor. [Basel Framework, CRE 54.28]  \\n196. K\\nCCP is calculated using the following formula  \\n𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃=�𝐸𝐸𝐴𝐴𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖×𝑀𝑀𝑅𝑅 ×𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚  𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝐹𝐹\\n𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 \\nwhere  \\n(1) RW is a risk weight of 20%45 \\n(2) Capital ratio means 8%  \\n(3) CM is the clearing member  \\n(4) EAD i is the exposure amount of the CCP to CM ‘i’, including both the CM’s own \\ntransactions and client transactions guaranteed by the CM, and all values of collateral held by the CCP (including the CM’s prefunded default fund contribution) against these transactions, relating to the valuation at the end of the regulatory reporting date before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged.  \\n(5) The sum is over all clearing member accounts.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.29]  \\n197. Where clearing members provide client clearing services, and client transactions and \\ncollateral are held in separate (individual or omnibus) sub- accounts to the clearing member’s \\nproprietary business, each such client sub- account should enter the sum in pa ragraph 196 \\n \\n45  The 20% risk weight is a minimum requirement. As with other parts of the capital adequacy framework, OSFI \\nmay increase the risk weight. An increase in such risk weight would be appropriate if, for example, the clearing \\nmembers in a CCP are not highly rated. Any such increase in risk weight is to be communicated by the affected \\ninstitutions to the person completing this calculation.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 64', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'chunk_index': 4, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:11.199783', 'file_size': 889263, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf', 'display_name': 'car24_chpt7.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165507_11ec1b2f-46d1-4b7a-9bb8-d9308689a671_car24_chpt7.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 64\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 - Page 64 separately, i.e. the member EAD in the formula above is then the sum of the client sub-\\naccount EADs and any house sub-account EAD.

For SFTs, EAD is equal to max(EBRM i – IM i – DF i; 0), where  \\n1) EBRM i denotes the exposure value to clearing member ‘i’ before risk mitigation under \\nChapter 4; where, for the purposes of this calculation, variation margin that has been \\nexchanged (before the margin called on the final margin call of that day) enters into the mark -to-market value of the transactions;  \\n2) IM\\ni is the initial margin collateral posted by the clearing member with the CCP;  \\n \\n46  A MPOR of 10 days must be used to calculate the CCP’s potential future exposure to its clearing members on \\nderivatives transactions  \\n47  For exposures to QCCPs located in jurisdictions where the SA -CCR has not been implemented the EAD may be \\ncomputed using the current exposure method as described Capital requirements for bank exposures to central \\ncounterparties . \\n\\n\\n## Page 65\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 65 3) DF i is the prefunded default fund contribution by the clearing member that will be \\napplied upon such clearing member’s default, either along with or immediately following \\nsuch member’s initial margin, to reduce the CCP loss.  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.34]  \\n202.

The second step in calculatingthe clearing member institution’s capital requirement for \\nits default fund contributions (K\\nCMi) is to apply the following formula:  \\n𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖=𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑎𝑚𝑚�𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃×�𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜\\n𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃+𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜�;8% ×2% ×𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜� \\nwhere  \\n• 𝐾𝐾𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖is the capital requirements on the default contribution of member i;  \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜is the total prefunded default fund contributions from clearing members ; \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑃𝑃 is the CCP’s pr efunded own resources ( e.g. contributed capital, retained \\nearnings, etc ), which are contributed to the default waterfall, where these are \\njunior or pari pass u to prefunded member  contributions ; and   \\n• 𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝐹𝐹𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜is the prefunded default fund contributions provided by clearing member i .  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 54.36]  \\n204.

Transactions settled through a delivery- versus -payment system (DvP) ,48 providing \\nsimultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose firms to a risk of loss on the difference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the transaction valued at \\ncurrent market price (i.e. , positive current exposure). Transactions where cash is paid without \\nreceipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, foreign currencies, gold, or commodities) or, \\nconversely, deliverables were delivered without receipt of the corresponding cash payment (non -\\nDvP, or free -delivery) expose firms to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or \\ndeliverables delivered. The current rules set out specific capital charges that address these two \\nkinds of exposures.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.3 and 70.4]  \\n 213. The following capital treatment is applicable to all transactions on securities, foreign \\nexchange instruments, and commodities that give rise to a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. \\nThis includes transactions through recogni zed clearing houses and central counterparties that are \\nsubject to daily mark -to-market and payment of daily variation margins and that involve a \\nmismatched trade .\\n49 The treatment does not apply to the instruments that are subject to the \\ncounterparty credit risk requirements set out in section 7.1 or the credit risk mitigation section of \\nchapter 4 of this guideline (i.e. over -the-counter derivatives, exchange -traded derivatives, long \\nsettlement transactions, securities financing transa ctions).[ Basel Framework, CRE 70.5]  \\n 214. In cases of a system wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central \\ncounterparty, a national supervisor may use its discretion to waive capital charges until the situation is rectified. [BCBS June 2006 Annex 3 par 4] and [Basel Framework, CRE 70.7]  \\n 215. Failure of a counterparty to settle a trade in itself will not be deemed a default for \\npurposes of credit risk under this guideline.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.8]  \\n 216. In applying a risk weight to failed free -delivery exposures, institutions using the IRB \\napproach for credit risk may assign PDs to counterparties for which they have no other banking book exposure on the basis of the counterparty’s external rating. Institutions using the Advanced IRB approach may use a 45 % LGD in lieu of estimating LGDs so long as they apply it to all \\nfailed trade exposures. Alternatively, institutions using the IRB approach may opt to apply the standardi zed approach risk weights or a 100% risk weight.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.10]  \\n \\n48  For the purpose of this guideline, DvP transactions include payment -versus -payment (PvP) transactions.  \\n49  An expos ure value of zero for counterparty credit risk can be attributed to payment transactions (e.g. funds \\ntransfer transactions) and other spot transactions that are outstanding with a central counterparty (e.g. a clearing \\nhouse), when the central counterparty CCR exposures with all participants in its arrangements are fully \\ncollateraliz ed on a daily basis.  \\n\\n\\n## Page 68\\n\\n \\n \\nBanks/BHC/T&L   Settlement and Counterparty Risk  \\n October 2023  Chapter 7 -  Page 68 7.2.2 Capital  requirements  \\n217. For DvP  transactions, if the payments have not yet taken place five business days after \\nthe settlement date, firms must calculate a capital charge by multiplying the positive current \\nexposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor, according to the Table 3. \\n \\n \\nTable 3  \\nNumber of working days after the \\nagreed settlement date  Corresponding risk multiplier  \\nFrom 5 to 15  8% \\nFrom 16 to 30  50% \\nFrom 31 to 45  75% \\n46 or more  100%  \\n[Basel Framework, CRE 70.9]  \\n \\n218. For non- DvP transactions (i.e. , free deliveries), after the first contractual \\npayment/delivery leg, the institution that has made the payment will treat its exposure as a loan if the second leg has not been received by the end of the business day.\\n50 This means that an \\ninstitution under the IRB approach will apply the appropriate IRB formula set out in this guideline, for the exposure to the counterparty, in the same way as it does for all other banking \\nbook exposures. Similarly, institutions under the standardi zed approach will use the s tandardi zed \\nrisk weights set forth in this guideline. However, when exposures are not material, institutions \\nmay choose to apply a uniform 100% risk- weight to these exposures, in order to avoid the \\nburden of a full credit assessment. If five business days after the second contractual payment/delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the institution that has \\nmade the first payment leg will deduct from capital the full amount of the value transferred plus \\nreplacement cost, if any. This  treatment will apply until the second payment/delivery leg is \\neffectively made.  [Basel Framework, CRE 70.4]  \\n \\n \\n50  If the dates when two payment legs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is \\nmade, it is deemed that they are settled on the same day.

Finance is broadly categorized\\ninto three areas: personal ﬁnance (managing individual or household ﬁnances), corporate\\nﬁnance (managing business ﬁnances), and public ﬁnance (managing government revenues\\nand expenditures). The primary goal of ﬁnance is to maximize value while balancing liq-\\nuidity and proﬁtability.\\nWhat is Risk?\\nRisk refers to the uncertainty or potential for loss in ﬁnancial decisions or investments.\\nIt arises from factors such as market volatility, economic changes, or unforeseen events.\\nIn ﬁnance, risk is often measured by the likelihood and magnitude of deviations from\\nexpected outcomes. Common types of ﬁnancial risk include market risk (price ﬂuctua-\\ntions), credit risk (default on loans), liquidity risk (inability to convert assets to cash),\\nand operational risk (failures in processes or systems).\\nThe Relationship Between Finance and Risk\\nFinance and risk are inherently linked, as ﬁnancial decisions involve weighing potential\\nreturns against uncertainties. Eﬀective ﬁnancial management requires assessing and mit-\\nigating risks through strategies like diversiﬁcation, hedging, or insurance.

We believe that the non-GAAP measures and ratios presented here, read together with our GAAP results, provide readerswith a better understanding of how management assesses results and are a reflection of ongoing business performance.\\nAdjusted results and measures in this section, including earnings per share (EPS), EPS growth, return on equity (ROE), return on tangible common\\nequity (ROTCE), net income, revenue, non-interest expense, efficiency ratio and operating leverage, are non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, an d\\nare discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nInformation regarding the composition of each of these measures is provided in the Glossary of Financial Terms.\\nFinancial Objectives\\nBMO has established medium-term financial objectives for certain important performance measures, which are set out below. Medium-term isgenerally defined as three to five years, and performance is assessed on an adjusted basis. These objectives serve as guideposts and assume anormal business environment and credit cycle. We aim to deliver top-tier total shareholder return and achieve our financial objectives by aligning o ur\\noperations with, and executing on, our strategic priorities.\\nOur business planning process is rigorous, sets ambitious goals and considers factors such as the prevailing economic environment, our risk\\nappetite, customers’ evolving needs and opportunities available across our operating groups. It includes clear and direct accountability for annu al\\nperformance that is measured against both internal and external benchmarks and progress toward our strategic priorities. We seek a balancebetween current profitability and investing to create sustainable growth. Our ability to achieve these objectives may be affected by changes in theeconomic, business or regulatory environment or extraordinary developments.\\nBMO’s results in fiscal 2024 were impacted by higher provisions for credit losses, in part due to a prolonged period of high interest rates, which\\nalso contributed to a more challenging U.S. banking market. Higher credit provisions more than offset our strong expense management. As a result,BMO did not achieve several of its medium-term financial objectives on an adjusted basis. Although an ROE of 15% will be challenging to meet in thenear term, in an environment where credit losses decline from elevated levels, we believe it to be an appropriate medium-term financial objective aswe execute our strategic plan to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our business. BMO has delivered positive operating leverage in four of th e\\nlast five years.

Unless otherwise indicated, all\\namounts are in Canadian dollars and have been derived from our audited annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance withInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. References to GAAP mean IFRS. We usea number of financial measures to assess our performance, as well as the performance of our operating segments, including amounts, measures andratios that are presented on a non-GAAP basis, as described below. We believe that these non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, read togetherwith our GAAP results, provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses results.\\nNon-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP. They are unlikely to be comparable to similar\\nmeasures presented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results.\\nFor further information regarding the composition of other financial measures, including supplementary financial measures, refer to the Glossary\\nof Financial Terms.\\nOur non-GAAP measures broadly fall into the following categories:\\nAdjusted measures and ratios\\nManagement considers both reported and adjusted results and measures to be useful in assessing underlying ongoing business performance.\\nAdjusted results and measures remove certain specified items from revenue, non-interest expense, provision for credit losses and income taxes, asdetailed in the following table. Adjusted results and measures presented in this document are non-GAAP. Presenting results on both a reported basisand an adjusted basis permits readers to assess the impact of certain items on results for the periods presented, and to better assess resultsexcluding those items that may not be reflective of ongoing business performance. As such, the presentation may facilitate readers’ analysis oftrends. Except as otherwise noted, management’s discussion of changes in reported results in this document applies equally to changes in thecorresponding adjusted results.\\nTangible common equity and return on tangible common equity\\nTangible common equity is calculated as common shareholders’ equity, less goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, net of related defe rred\\ntax liabilities. Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) is calculated as net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for the amortizati on\\nof acquisition-related intangible assets, as a percentage of average tangible common equity. ROTCE is commonly used in the North American bankingindustry and is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed organically.\\nMeasures net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities\\nFor periods prior to November 1, 2022, we presented adjusted revenue on a basis net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefitliabilities (CCPB), and our efficiency ratio and operating leverage were calculated on a similar basis.

However, the federal government’s intent tosignificantly reduce immigration and the expected rate of population growth over the next two years implies some downside risk to GDP growth. Theunemployment rate increased by almost one percentage point during the past year to 6.5% in October 2024, due to a rapidly expanding labour forceand slowing employment growth. The unemployment rate is anticipated to rise to 7.0% by early 2025, before falling modestly as economic growthimproves and population growth slows. Easing labour shortages and lower gasoline prices contributed to the moderate 2.0% year-over-year growthin the consumer price index in October 2024. With inflation declining faster than anticipated, the Bank of Canada has lowered its key policy rate by acumulative 125 basis points since June 2024 and is expected to reduce it by an additional 125 basis points to 2.5% by June 2025. The housing marketis projected to strengthen in 2025 as a result of lower mortgage rates and new mortgage rules intended to support first-time home buyers. Industry-wide growth in residential mortgage balances remained stable at 3.5% year-over-year in September 2024, but is projected to gradually pick up ashousing market activity improves in 2025. Year-over-year growth in consumer credit (excluding mortgages) increased to 4.0% in September 2024,amid strong growth in credit card balances, though this is unlikely to be sustained in 2025. Growth in non-financial corporate credit balancesdecelerated sharply in 2024 as a result of weak business investment and elevated cash balances, but is expected to increase at a moderate pacein 2025 in response to lower interest rates. The Canadian dollar will likely remain weak due to the lower interest rate environment in Canada relativeto the United States and the threat of higher tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States, before appreciating modestly in 2025 as the U.S. dollarweakens on an easing Federal Reserve policy.\\nU.S. real GDP growth is estimated to have moderated slightly to an annual rate of 2.7% in 2024 from 2.9% in 2023, amid continued strength in\\nconsumer, business and government spending, partially offset by weaker housing market activity. With support from lower interest rates andexpansionary fiscal policies, including a possible reduction in the corporate tax rate, the economy is projected to continue growing at a healthy rat e\\nof 2.2% in 2025. While employment growth remains solid, the unemployment rate increased from a half-century low of 3.4% in April 2023 to 4.1% inOctober 2024 and is projected to rise slightly to 4.3% in early 2025. The easing in labour market conditions has reduced pressure on inflation,resulting in year-over-year growth in the consumer price index moderating to 2.6% in October 2024. The Federal Reserve lowered its key lending ratefor the first time in four years in September 2024 by 50 basis points and again in November by 25 basis points, and is projected to reduce the ratefurther by a cumulative 125 basis points to a range of 3.25% to 3.50% by late 2025. Growth in residential mortgage balances has slowedconsiderably to 1.9% year-over-year in October 2024 due to ongoing weakness in home sales, but will likely strengthen moderately in 2025 givenanticipated declines in mortgage rates. Despite increased credit card use, year-over-year growth in consumer loan balances decelerated to 1.5% inOctober 2024, but is projected to grow in 2025 due to lower interest rates. Growth in commercial, industrial and commercial real estate creditremains weak due to still elevated borrowing costs, stricter lending conditions and weakness in the office real estate market, though it is expected t o\\nstrengthen in 2025 in response to lower interest rates.\\nThe economic outlook is subject to several risks that could lead to a less favourable outcome for the North American economy. These include\\npotential higher tariffs on U.S. imports, an escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, heightened tensions between the United States an d\\nChina over trade relations and Taiwan, tensions between Canada and India, and a possible strike by U.S. East and Gulf Coast dockworkers inJanuary 2025. In addition, the Canadian dollar faces downside risks from possible U.S. tariffs and the upcoming renegotiation of the Canada-UnitedStates-Mexico Trade Agreement (CUSMA) in 2026.

Net interest income, excluding tradin g, is presented on a basis that excludes trading-related interest incom e.\\nNet Interest Margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, exp ressed as a percentage or in basi s points. Net interest margin,\\nexcluding trading net interest income, and tradi ng and insurance average assets is calculated in th e same manner, excluding trading-related intere st\\nincome, and trading and insurance earning assets.\\nAverage Earning Assets represent the daily average balance of deposits at central b anks, deposits with other banks, securities borrowed or\\npurchased under resale agreements, securities and loans over the period.\\nTrading-Related Revenue comprises net interest income and non-interest revenue ea rned from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions\\nundertaken for trading purposes. We earn revenue from profitably managi ng our positions with clients and, on a limited basis, from our principal\\ntrading positions, subject to prescribed limits. The management of these p ositions typically includes marking them to market on a daily basis. Since\\ntrading activities and related risk management s trategies can periodically shift trading income between net interest income and non-interest inco me,\\nwe view total trading income as the most appropriate measure of trading performance.\\nNet Interest Income\\nReported net interest income was $19,468 million, an increase of $787 million or 4% from the prior year, and adjusted net interest incomewas $18,921 million, a decrease of $173 million or 1% from the prior year.\\nThe increase in reported net interest income primarily reflected the reversal of accrued interest on the fiscal 2022 legal provision in the current\\nyear and the impact of fair value management actions related to Bank of the West in the prior year. Adjusted net interest income decreased, reflectingstrong growth in Canadian P&C driven by higher balances and margins, higher balances in U.S. P&C and an increase in non-trading interest income inBMO Capital Markets, more than offset by lower net interest income in Corporate Services and lower trading-related net interest income. Trading-related net interest income was $169 million, a decrease of $731 million from the prior year, and was largely offset in trading non-interest revenue.\\nBMO’s overall reported net interest margin of 1.57% decreased 6 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted net interest margin, excluding\\ntrading-related net interest income, and trading and insurance assets was 1.85%, a decrease of 3 basis points, primarily due to lower net interestincome and higher low-yielding assets in Corporate Services, partially offset by higher margins in BMO Capital Markets and Canadian P&C.\\nChange in Net Interest Income, Average Earning Assets and Net Interest Margin(1)\\nTABLE 10\\nNet interest margin\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted) Net interest income (2) Average earning assets (3) (in basis points)\\nFor the year ended October 31 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\\nCanadian P&C 8,852 8,043 319,795 296,164 277 272\\nU.S. P&C 8,162 7,607 215,987 195,363 378 389\\nPersonal and Commercial Banking (P&C) 17,014 15,650 535,782 491,527 318 318\\nAll other operating groups and Corporate Services (4) 2,454 3,031 701,463 654,343 na na\\nTotal reported 19,468 18,681 1,237,245 1,145,870 157 163\\nTotal adjusted 18,921 19,094 1,237,245 1,145,870 153 167\\nTrading net interest income, trading and insurance assets 169 900 222,149 180,005 na na\\nTotal reported, excluding trading and insurance 19,299 17,781 1,015,096 965,865 190 184\\nTotal adjusted, excluding trading and insurance 18,752 18,194 1,015,096 965,865 185 188\\nU.S. P&C (US$ in millions) 6,006 5,635 158,919 144,732 378 389\\n(1) Adjusted results and ratios are on a non-GAAP basis and are discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\n(2) Operating group revenue is presented on a taxable equivalent basis (teb) in net interest income.

The reported effective tax rate was 23.2%, compared with 25.4% in\\nthe prior year, primarily due to earnings mix, including the impact of certain Canadian tax measures recorded in fiscal 2023. The adjusted provision f or\\nincome taxes was $2,213 million, compared with $2,517 million in the prior year. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.9%, compared with 22.4% inthe prior year.\\nBMO partially hedges, for accounting purposes, the foreign exchange risk arising from investments in foreign operations by funding the\\ninvestments in the corresponding foreign currency. A gain or loss on hedging activities and an unrealized gain or loss on translation of foreignoperations are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. For income tax purposes, a gain or loss on hedging activities results in an incometax charge or credit in the current period that is charged or credited to other comprehensive income, while the associated unrealized gain or loss oninvestments in foreign operations does not incur income taxes until the investments are liquidated. The income tax charge/benefit arising from ahedging gain/loss is a function of the fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period. Hedging of investments in foreign operations has givenrise to an income tax recovery in other comprehensive income of $38 million in the current year, compared with a recovery of $90 million in theprior year.\\nThe provision for income taxes presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income is based on transactions recorded in income, regardless of\\nwhen such transactions are subject to taxation by tax authorities, with the exception of the repatriation of retained earnings from subsidiaries.\\nManagement assesses BMO’s consolidated results and the associated provision for income taxes on a GAAP basis.

Operating segment results include allocations from Corporate Services fortreasury-related revenue, corporate and T&O costs, and capital.\\nBMO employs funds transfer pricing and liquidity transfer pricing between corporate treasury and the operating segments in order to assign cost\\nor credit on assets and liabilities to facilitate effective pricing and business decision-making, and to help assess the profitability performance of each\\nline of business. These practices also capture the cost of holding supplemental liquid assets to meet contingent liquidity requirements, as well asfacilitating the management of interest rate and liquidity risk within our risk appetite framework and regulatory requirements. We review our trans fer\\npricing methodologies at least annually in order to align with our interest rate, liquidity and funding risk management practices, and update these a s\\nappropriate.\\nThe costs of Corporate Units and T&O services are largely allocated to the four operating segments, with any remaining amounts retained in\\nCorporate Services. Certain expenses directly incurred to support a specific operating segment are generally allocated to that operating segment.Other expenses are generally allocated across the operating segments in amounts that are reasonably reflective of the level of support provided toeach operating segment. We review our expense allocation methodologies at least annually, and update these as appropriate.\\nPeriodically, certain lines of business and units within our organizational structure are realigned within an operating segment or transferred\\nbetween operating segments and Corporate Services to support our strategic priorities. Allocations of revenue, expenses, provisions for income ta xes\\nand capital from Corporate Services to the operating groups are updated to better align with these changes.\\nCapital is allocated to the operating segments based on the amount of regulatory capital required to support business activities. Effective\\nfiscal 2024, our capital allocation rate increased to 11.5% of risk-weighted assets, compared with 11.0% in fiscal 2023, in order to reflect an increa se\\nin capital requirements. Unallocated capital is reported in Corporate Services. We review our capital allocation methodologies at least annually, and\\nupdate these as appropriate.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17), and retrospectively applied it to fiscal 2023\\nresults and opening retained earnings as at November 1, 2022. Insurance results are now presented in non-interest revenue under insurance serviceresults and insurance investment results. Insurance service results include insurance revenue, insurance service expenses and reinsurance resul ts.\\nInsurance investment results include net returns on insurance-related assets and the impact of the change in discount rates and financial assumptio ns\\non insurance contract liabilities. As a result of the transition to IFRS 17, we no longer report insurance claims, commissions and changes in policybenefits as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\\nUpon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for the measurement of investment properties under IAS 40, Investment\\nProperties (IAS 40), recorded in insurance-related assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet from cost to fair value. This change was applied\\nretrospectively to fiscal 2023 results and opening retained earnings as at November 1, 2022.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 33\\n\\n\\n## Page 22\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nThese changes did not have a material impact on regulatory capital ratios. Refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section for further\\ndetails.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for securities transactions from the settlement date to the\\ntrade date. This change was applied retrospectively, as if we had always recorded securities transactions on the trade date. As a result, there was anincrease in other assets and other liabilities due to the earlier recognition of transactions, as well as the reclassification of certain balance she et items.\\nFiscal 2023 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s accounting policy change.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the allocation of certain items from Corporate Services to the operating groups was updated to align with\\nunderlying business activity, including transfer pricing methodologies. Comparative results and ratios have been reclassified to conform with th e\\ncurrent period’s presentation.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, balances and associated revenue, expenses and provisions for credit losses related to our Canadian and\\nU.S. indirect retail auto financing business, previously reported in Personal and Commercial Banking, are reported in Corporate Services, reflect ing the\\nexit and wind-down of this business unit. Fiscal 2023 comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current period’s presentation.\\nWe analyze revenue at the consolidated level based on GAAP revenue as reported in the audited annual consolidated financial statements, rather\\nthan on a taxable equivalent basis (teb), which is consistent with our Canadian banking peer group. Like many banks, BMO analyzes revenue on a tebbasis at the operating segment level. Revenue and the provision for income taxes in BMO Capital Markets and U.S. P&C are increased on tax-exemptsecurities to equivalent pre-tax amounts in order to facilitate comparisons of income from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The offset to the segmentteb adjustments is reflected in Corporate Services revenue and provision for (recovery of) income taxes. Beginning January 1, 2024, we treatedcertain Canadian dividends in BMO Capital Markets as non-deductible for tax purposes, due to legislation that was enacted by the Canadiangovernment in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result, we no longer report this revenue on a teb basis.

Net interest income increased $809 million or 10%,\\ndue to higher balances and net interest margins. Non-interest revenue increased $71 million or 3%, primarily due to the inclusion of AIR MILES, highermutual fund distribution fee revenue and card-related revenue, partially offset by lower commercial lending fee revenue. Net interest marginof 2.77% increased 5 basis points from the prior year, due to higher loan margins and deposits growing faster than loans, partially offset by lowerdeposit margins. The impact of the transition of bankers’ acceptances exposures to loans in Commercial Banking resulted in lower non-interestrevenue offset in net interest income, with a modest reduction in the net interest margin.\\nPersonal and Business Banking revenue increased $694 million or 9%, due to higher net interest income and non-interest revenue. Commercial\\nBanking revenue increased $186 million or 6%, due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue.\\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1,659 million, an increase of $750 million from the prior year. The provision for credit losses on impaired\\nloans was $1,326 million, an increase of $602 million from the prior year, reflecting higher provisions in Personal and Business Banking, driven byunsecured segments of the consumer portfolio, and Commercial Banking. There was a $333 million provision for credit losses on performing loans inthe current year, compared with a $185 million provision in the prior year.\\nNon-interest expense was $5,005 million, an increase of $282 million or 6% from the prior year, reflecting the inclusion of AIR MILES, and higher\\noperating and technology costs, partially offset by severance in the prior year.\\nAverage gross loans and acceptances increased $16.8 billion or 5% from the prior year.

With inflation returning to targete d\\nlevels, the Bank of Canada lowered its key policy rate by a cumulative 125 basis points starting in June 2024, although policy rates remain restrictive .\\nGDP growth slowed slightly compared with the prior year and the unemployment rate increased by almost 1% to 6.5% as at October 2024.\\nThe higher interest rate environment continued to drive steady growth in term deposits for most of fiscal 2024, including ongoing migration from\\nchequing and savings accounts, which began to abate in recent months as interest rates declined and equity markets improved. In response to slowerhousing market activity, mortgage growth moderated from the prior year, but remained healthy, supported by robust population growth and strongcustomer acquisition. Credit card growth remained strong, supported by continued account growth and consumer spending, and higher revolvingbalances. Business lending growth eased, as clients continued to manage their balance sheets in the higher interest rate environment. Credit lossesincreased, with higher consumer delinquencies and insolvencies reflecting rising unemployment, as well as higher impairment rates for businessbanking and commercial clients.\\nThe Canadian economy is expected to expand moderately in 2025 and the Bank of Canada is anticipated to reduce interest rates by an\\nadditional 125 basis points to 2.5% by June 2025. Deposit growth is expected to continue to slow, reflecting a decrease in demand for term depositsas customers seeking higher yielding products migrate to equity markets. Mortgage growth is forecasted to gradually pick up as housing marketactivity improves and new mortgage rules take effect. Credit card growth is expected to ease from current high levels. Business lending is expectedto improve at a moderate pace in 2025 in response to lower interest rates. The lower cost of borrowing is expected to ease pressure on householdand business balance sheets through the year.\\nWe continue to invest in our business with a focus on delivering exceptional customer solutions and advice, together with leading digital\\nexperiences, and execute on our strategy to drive business growth in any environment.\\nThe Canadian economic environment in calendar 2024 and the outlook for calendar 2025 are discussed in more detail in the Economic\\nDevelopments and Outlook section.\\nCautionThis Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking section contains forward-looking statements.

U.S. GDP growth in 2024 moderated slightly from 2023, but remained strong. However, the U.S. banking industryexperienced muted loan demand and continued competition for deposits, reflecting the high interest rate environment, which increased funding cost s\\nand put pressure on net interest margins. Year-over-year growth in overall commercial loan balances decelerated in response to high interest rates,weakness in the commercial real estate market and uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election, while mortgage and home equityloans moderated amid a weaker housing market. Deposit growth improved in the second half of the year, benefitting from good customer acquisitionas a result of investments in marketing and digital capabilities. Provisions for credit losses have increased and were elevated in the second half of t he\\nyear, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates on debt servicing costs, changes in consumer preferences for products and services, and weaknes s\\nin the commercial real estate and transportation sectors.\\nThe U.S. economy is projected to grow at a healthy but more moderate pace in calendar 2025, supported by lower interest rates and\\nexpansionary fiscal policies, including a possible reduction in the corporate tax rate. The Federal Reserve lowered its key lending rate for the firs t time\\nin four years in September 2024 by 50 basis points and will likely continue to reduce rates in 2025. As a result, business and consumer lendingdemand is expected to improve through fiscal 2025 while deposit costs should stabilize. The lower cost of borrowing is expected to ease pressure onhousehold and business balance sheets.\\nLeveraging our diversified Commercial Banking franchise, an expanded Personal and Business Banking franchise and a national digital deposit\\nplatform, we are well-positioned to drive profitable growth and customer loyalty. We will remain focused on driving efficiencies by simplifying andstreamlining operations and investing in digital capabilities.\\nThe U.S. economic environment in calendar 2024 and the outlook for calendar 2025 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Developments\\nand Outlook section.\\nCautionThis U.S. Personal and Commercial Banking section contains forward-looking statements.

IFRS 17\\nprovides a comprehensive approach to accounting for all types of insurance contracts and replaced IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts. Insurance results are\\nnow presented in non-interest revenue under insurance service results and insurance investment results. As a result of the adoption and retrospecti ve\\napplication of IFRS 17 to our fiscal 2023 results, we no longer report insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities. For fu rther\\ndetails, refer to Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nReported net income was $1,248 million, an increase of $102 million or 9% from the prior year. Wealth and Asset Management reported net income\\nwas $1,012 million, an increase of $188 million or 23%, and included one additional quarter of Bank of the West results, compared with the prioryear. Insurance net income was $236 million, a decrease of $86 million or 27%.\\nTotal revenue was $5,646 million, an increase of $235 million or 4%. Revenue in Wealth and Asset Management was $5,279 million, an increase\\nof $349 million or 7%, due to growth in client assets, including the impact of stronger global markets, and higher revenue from online brokeragetransactions, partially offset by lower net interest income due to lower margins. Insurance revenue was $367 million, a decrease of $114 million,reflecting changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS 17.\\nThe total provision for credit losses was $31 million, compared with an $18 million provision in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on\\nimpaired loans increased $21 million and the provision for credit losses on performing loans decreased $8 million.\\nNon-interest expense was $3,968 million, an increase of $90 million or 2% from the prior year, due to higher revenue-based costs and our\\ninvestment in talent, partially offset by operational efficiencies.\\nAssets under management increased $89.8 billion or 27% from the prior year to $422.7 billion, driven by stronger global markets and higher net\\nclient assets. Assets under administration decreased $55.1 billion or 13% to $361.2 billion, primarily due to the exit of our Institutional Trust Ser vices\\noperations in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by stronger global markets. Average gross loans increased 5% and average deposits we re\\nrelatively unchanged from the prior year.\\nFor further information on non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios in this 2024 Operating Groups Performance Review section, refer to the\\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.\\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\\nBMO Wealth Management results benefitted from growing momentum in equity markets through fiscal 2024, with a moderation of inflationarypressures and declining interest rates in the second half of the year. Higher assets under management from stronger global markets and net newasset flows supported revenue growth, offsetting the industry-wide reduction in asset yields and lower net interest margins from deposit migrationto higher yielding assets.

All periodsincluded acquisition and integration costs, as well as the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which increased in fiscal 2023, due to\\nthe acquisition of Bank of the West.\\nFinancial performance benefitted from the strength and diversification of our businesses. Results were impacted by a higher interest rate\\nenvironment and uncertain economic conditions resulting in higher credit provisions, slower loan demand and lower levels of client activity in ourmarket-sensitive businesses.\\nRevenue growth in Canadian P&C reflected good customer acquisition and volume growth and higher net interest margins. U.S. P&C revenue\\nperformance benefitted from the inclusion of Bank of the West; however, recent quarters have been impacted by a more muted U.S. bankingenvironment, with reduced loan demand and higher deposit costs. Revenue in BMO Wealth Management benefitted from steady growth in clientassets, including the impact of improved global markets in fiscal 2024, while high interest rates resulted in a shift in deposit mix to term deposits an d\\nreduced margins. Insurance revenue is subject to variability resulting from market-related impacts, including changes in portfolio positioning d uring\\nthe transition to IFRS 17.

Adjusted results excluded the specified items noted in the Summary Quarterly Earnings Trends section.\\nReported net income increased from the prior year, primarily due to the reversal of the fiscal 2022 legal provision, including accrued interest, and\\nlower acquisition and integration costs, compared with the prior year. The decrease in adjusted net income reflected a higher provision for creditlosses, partially offset by lower expenses, with revenue relatively unchanged from the prior year. Reported and adjusted net income decreased acros s\\nall operating segments. Corporate Services recorded net income on a reported basis, compared with a net loss in the prior year, and a lower net losson an adjusted basis.\\nRevenue\\nReported revenue was $8,957 million, an increase of $638 million or 8% from the prior year, due to the reversal of accrued interest on the legalprovision in the current year. Adjusted revenue was $8,368 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year, with higher non-interest revenuepartially offset by lower net interest income. Adjusted net interest income decreased, primarily due to lower trading-related net interest income a nd\\nlower net interest income in Corporate Services due to lower net accretion of purchase accounting fair value marks, partially offset by higher netinterest income in Canadian P&C due to higher balances and higher non-trading interest income in BMO Capital Markets. Non-interest revenueincreased, primarily driven by higher trading revenue, investment management and custodial fee revenue and mutual fund fee revenue, partiallyoffset by lower insurance-related revenue reflecting changes in portfolio positioning during the transition to IFRS 17, the impact of mark-downs onthe held-for-sale loan portfolio and lower lending fee revenue, largely offset in net interest income reflecting the transition of bankers’ accepta nces\\nexposures to loans, and lower card fee revenue.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 53\\n\\n\\n## Page 42', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 4, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667285', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 42\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nProvision for Credit Losses\\nTotal provision for credit losses was $1,523 million, compared with a provision of $446 million in the prior year. Total provision for credit losses as a\\npercentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 91 basis points, compared with 27 basis points in the prior year. The provision for creditlosses on impaired loans was $1,107 million, an increase of $699 million, due to higher provisions across operating segments, primarily in the U.S.corporate and commercial portfolio, and in the Canadian unsecured segments of the consumer portfolio. The provision for credit losses on impairedloans as a percentage of average net loans and acceptances ratio was 66 basis points, compared with 25 basis points in the prior year. There wasa $416 million provision for credit losses on performing loans, compared with a $38 million provision in the prior year, primarily driven by portfoliocredit migration, as well as uncertainty in credit conditions.\\nNon-Interest Expense\\nReported non-interest expense was $4,427 million, a decrease of $1,252 million or 22% from the prior year, and adjusted non-interest expensewas $4,876 million, a decrease of $100 million or 2%. Reported results reflected the reversal of the legal provision and the impact of loweracquisition and integration costs in the current year. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased, primarily due to our continued focus on operationa l\\nefficiencies, including realized cost synergies related to Bank of the West, and lower premises costs, including the charge in the prior year related to\\nthe consolidation of BMO real estate, and other operating costs.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThe reported provision for income taxes was $703 million, an increase of $219 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and the adjustedprovision for income taxes was $427 million, a decrease of $241 million. The reported effective tax rate was 23.4%, compared with 22.1% in thefourth quarter of fiscal 2023, and the adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7%, compared with 22.9%. The change in the reported effective tax raterelative to the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the impact of higher income in the current year, and the change in the adjusted effectivetax rate was primarily due to earnings mix, including the impact of lower income in the current quarter.\\nQ4 2024 vs. Q3 2024\\nReported net income increased $439 million or 24% from the prior quarter, and adjusted net income decreased $439 million or 22%. Reported netincome increased primarily due to the reversal of the legal provision. The decrease in adjusted net income reflected a higher provision for creditlosses and higher expenses, partially offset by higher revenue. Reported and adjusted net income decreased across all operating segments. Corporat e\\nServices recorded net income on a reported basis, compared with a net loss in the prior quarter, and a lower net loss on an adjusted basis. Reportedrevenue increased $765 million or 9% from the prior quarter, and adjusted revenue increased $162 million or 2%. Reported revenue reflected highernet interest income, primarily driven by the reversal of accrued interest on the legal provision. Reported and adjusted revenue reflected higher netinterest income, driven by higher Corporate Services and Canadian P&C net interest income, as well as higher non-trading interest income in BMOCapital Markets, partially offset by lower trading-related net interest income, and higher non-interest revenue, driven by higher trading revenue and\\nunderwriting and advisory fee revenue, partially offset by lower card and lending fee revenue. Reported non-interest expense decreased $412 millio n\\nor 9% from the prior quarter, due to the reversal of the legal provision, and adjusted non-interest expense increased $179 million or 4%, primarilydue to higher professional fees and higher association, clearing and annual regulator fees. Total provision for credit losses increased $617 millio n\\nfrom the prior quarter. The provision for credit losses on impaired loans increased $279 million, due to higher provisions in the corporate andcommercial portfolio.

In addition, we completed the acquisition of the AIR MILES Reward Program (AIR MILES) on June 1, 2023, which contributed to theincrease in revenue and expenses in our Canadian P&C business beginning the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\\nPrior to November 1, 2022, we presented revenue on a basis net of insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities\\n(CCPB). Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we no longer report CCPB, given the adoption and retrospective application of IFRS 17, Insurance\\nContracts (IFRS 17).

The decrease in reported results primarily reflected actions to manage the impact of interest ratechanges between the announcement and closing of the Bank of the West acquisition on its fair value and goodwill which resulted in a net loss infiscal 2023, compared with a net gain in fiscal 2022, and the impact of a lawsuit associated with a predecessor bank, M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank, infiscal 2022, partially offset by higher acquisition and integration costs, an initial provision for credit losses on the purchased Bank of the West lo an\\nportfolio, as well as higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to the Bank of the West acquisition in fiscal 2023, and th e\\nimpact of certain tax measures enacted by the Canadian government.\\nAdjusted net income decreased, as the inclusion of Bank of the West and higher underlying revenue were more than offset by higher expenses\\nand a higher provision for credit losses. Reported and adjusted net income increased in U.S. P&C and decreased in BMO Wealth Management,Canadian P&C and BMO Capital Markets. On a reported basis, Corporate Services recorded a net loss in fiscal 2023, compared with net income infiscal 2022, primarily due to the items noted above. On an adjusted basis, Corporate Services recorded a higher net loss.\\nRevenue\\nReported revenue in fiscal 2023 was $29,259 million, a decrease of $4,451 million or 13% from fiscal 2022, primarily due to the impact of fair valuemanagement actions and interest expense related to the legal provision, as noted above. On an adjusted basis, and net of insurance claims,commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB) in fiscal 2022, revenue increased $4,905 million, due to the inclusion of Bank of the Wes t\\nand AIR MILES, as well as higher revenue in Canadian P&C and BMO Capital Markets.\\nProvision for Credit Losses\\nThe total provision for credit losses (PCL) in fiscal 2023 was $2,178 million on a reported basis and $1,473 million on an adjusted basis, comparedwith $313 million on both a reported and an adjusted basis in fiscal 2022. PCL on impaired loans was $1,180 million in fiscal 2023, an increaseof $678 million from fiscal 2022, with higher provisions across all businesses. PCL on performing loans in fiscal 2023 was $998 million on a reportedbasis, including the initial provision of $705 million on the purchased Bank of the West performing loan portfolio, and $293 million on an adjustedbasis, compared with a reported and an adjusted recovery of credit losses of $189 million in fiscal 2022.\\nNon-Interest Expense\\nReported non-interest expense in fiscal 2023 was $21,134 million, an increase of $4,940 million or 31% from fiscal 2022, and adjusted non-interestexpense was $18,713 million, an increase of $3,519 million or 23% from fiscal 2022. Reported non-interest expense in fiscal 2023 included higheracquisition and integration costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, compared with fiscal 2022, partially offset by the l ower\\nlegal expense related to the lawsuit associated with M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank. Reported and adjusted non-interest expense increased, primarilydue to the inclusion of Bank of the West, as well as higher employee-related, technology, advertising and business development costs, and legalprovisions in fiscal 2023.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nThe provision for income taxes in fiscal 2023 was $1,510 million, compared with $4,349 million in fiscal 2022. The reported effective tax rate infiscal 2023 was 25.4%, compared with 24.3% in fiscal 2022, with the increase primarily due to the impact of certain Canadian tax measures duringthe 2023 fiscal year. The adjusted provision for income taxes in fiscal 2023 was $2,517 million, compared with $2,670 million in fiscal 2022. Theadjusted effective tax rate was 22.4% in fiscal 2023, compared with 22.8% in fiscal 2022.\\n56BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 45\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Financial Condition Review\\nSummary Balance Sheet\\nTABLE 24\\n(Canadian $ in millions)\\nAs at October 31 2024 2023\\nAssets\\nCash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits with banks 68,738 82,043\\nSecurities 396,880 320,084\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements 110,907 115,662\\nNet loans 678,016 656,665\\nDerivative instruments 47,253 39,976\\nOther assets 107,853 132,576\\nTotal assets 1,409,647 1,347,006\\nLiabilities and Equity\\nDeposits 982,440 910,879\\nDerivative instruments 58,303 50,193\\nSecurities lent or sold under repurchase agreements 110,791 106,108\\nOther liabilities 165,450 195,475\\nSubordinated debt 8,377 8,228\\nEquity 84,250 76,095\\nNon-controlling interest in subsidiaries 36 28\\nTotal liabilities and equity 1,409,647 1,347,006\\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified for changes in accounting policy.\\nOverview\\nTotal assets of $1,409.6 billion increased $62.6 billion from October 31, 2023.

Details on our enterprise-wide capital management practices and strategies can be found below.\\nEnterprise-Wide Capital Management\\nCapital Management\\nObjective\\nBMO is committed to a disciplined approach to capital management that balances the interests and requirements of our shareholders, regulators,depositors, fixed income investors and rating agencies. We recognize the global trend of rising regulatory capital requirements, and manage ourcapital position accordingly. Our objective is to maintain a strong and optimized capital position in a cost-effective structure that:\\n‰Is appropriate given BMO’s target regulatory capital ratios and internal assessment of economic capital requirements\\n‰Underpins BMO’s operating groups’ business strategies and considers the market environment\\n‰Supports depositor, investor and regulator confidence, and dividends, while building long-term shareholder value\\n‰Is consistent with BMO’s target credit ratings.\\nFramework\\nCapital Supply\\nCapital available\\nto support risksCapital Demand\\nCapital required to support\\nthe risks underlying our\\nbusiness activitiesCapital adequacy\\nassessment of capital\\ndemand and supply\\nThe principles and key elements of our capital management framework are outlined in our Capital Management Corporate Policy and in the annual\\ncapital plan, which includes the results of the comprehensive Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\\nICAAP is an integrated process that involves the application of stress testing and other tools to assess capital adequacy on both a regulatory and\\nan economic basis. The results of this process inform and support the establishment of capital targets and the implementation of capital strategiesthat take into consideration the strategic direction and risk appetite of the enterprise. The annual capital plan is developed considering the resul ts of\\nICAAP and in conjunction with the annual business plan, promoting alignment between business and risk strategies, regulatory and economic capitalrequirements and the availability of capital. Enterprise-wide stress testing and scenario analysis are conducted in order to assess the impact of va rious\\nstress conditions on our risk profile and capital requirements.\\nOur capital management framework seeks to ensure that the bank is adequately capitalized given the risks we assume in the normal course of\\nbusiness, as well as under stress, and supports the determination of limits, targets and performance measures that are applied in managing balancesheet positions, risk levels and capital requirements at the consolidated entity, legal entity and operating group levels. We seek to optimize ourcapital through efficient use of our balance sheet and the related risks we undertake, and may employ levers such as risk transfer transactions andthe sale of assets. We evaluate assessments of actual and forecasted capital adequacy against our capital targets throughout the year, includingconsideration of changes in our business activities and risk profile, the operating environment, our competitors, and current and future regulator y\\nexpectations.\\nWe allocate capital to operating groups in order to evaluate business performance, and we consider capital implications in our strategic, tactical\\nand transactional decision-making. By allocating capital to operating groups, setting and monitoring capital limits and metrics, and measuring th e\\ngroups’ performance against these limits and metrics, we seek to optimize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, while maintaining awell-capitalized position.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 59\\n\\n\\n## Page 48\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nThis approach is intended to protect interested parties from the risks inherent in our various businesses, while still providing the flexibility to\\ndeploy resources in support of strategic growth activities and to maintain dividends.\\nRefer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section for further discussion of the risks underlying our business.\\nGovernance\\nThe Board of Directors, either directly or through its Risk Review Committee, provides ultimate oversight and approval of capital management,including the bank’s Capital Management Corporate Policy, capital plan and capital adequacy assessments. The Board of Directors regularly reviewsthe bank’s capital position and key capital management activities. In addition, the capital adequacy assessment results determined by ICAAP areapproved by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Risk Review Committee. The Enterprise Capital Management Committee providessenior management oversight, including the review of significant capital management policies, issues and activities, and the capital required tosupport the execution of our enterprise-wide strategy. Finance and Risk Management are responsible for the design and implementation of ourcorporate policies and frameworks related to capital and risk management, as well as ICAAP. The Corporate Audit Division, as the third line ofdefence, verifies adherence to controls and identifies opportunities to strengthen our processes. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk ManagementFramework section for further discussion.\\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\\nRegulatory capital requirements for BMO are determined in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI, which are based on the Basel III frameworkdeveloped by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The current minimum risk-based capital ratios set out in OSFI’s Capital AdequacyRequirements (CAR) Guideline are a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 6.0% and a Total Capital Ratio of 8.0%. Inaddition to these minimum capital requirements, OSFI also requires domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), including BMO, to hold Pillar 1and Pillar 2 buffers, which are meant to be used as a normal first response in periods of stress. Pillar 1 buffers include a capital conservation bufferof 2.5%, a D-SIB Common Equity Tier 1 surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer, which can range from 0% to 2.5%, depending on a bank’sexposure to jurisdictions that have activated the buffer. If a bank’s capital ratios fall below the range of the combined minimum and Pillar 1 buffers,restrictions on discretionary distributions of earnings (such as dividends, share repurchases and discretionary compensation) could ensue, with the\\ndegree of such restrictions varying according to the position of the bank’s ratios. Pillar 2 buffers address risks associated with systemic vulnerab ilities\\nand include the domestic stability buffer (DSB), which can range from 0% to 4.0% of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and was 3.5% as atOctober 31, 2024. The buffer level is set twice a year by OSFI, in June and December, but OSFI can make a change at any time when needed. UnderOSFI guidelines, breaches of the DSB do not automatically result in constraints on capital distributions. In the event of a breach, OSFI would require a\\nremediation plan and would expect the plan to be executed in a timely manner. Banks may be required to hold additional regulatory buffers that areapplicable to the capital ratios, the Leverage and the Total Loss Absorbing Capital (TLAC) Ratios.\\nTLAC comprises the aggregate of Total Capital and Other TLAC instruments that allow conversion, in whole or in part, into common shares under\\ntheCanada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act and meet the eligibility criteria under the TLAC Guideline.

Canada\\nDeposit Insurance Corporation has the power to trigger the conversion of bail-in debt into common shares. This statutory conversion supplementsNVCC securities, which must be converted in full prior to the conversion of bail-in debt.\\nRisk-Weighted Assets\\nRisk-weighted assets (RWA) measure a bank’s exposures, weighted for their relative risk and calculated in accordance with the regulatory capitalrules prescribed by OSFI, which include standardized and internal ratings or internal model approaches for credit and market risk, and standardizedapproaches for operational risk.\\nWe primarily use the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach to determine credit RWA in our portfolio. The IRB Approach includes the Foundation\\n(FIRB) Approach for exposures to financial institutions and large corporate portfolios, and the Advanced (AIRB) Approach for all other exposures. T he\\nAIRB Approach applies sophisticated techniques to measure RWA at the exposure level based on sound risk management principles, includingestimates of the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) risk parameters, as well as term to maturity and\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 61\\n\\n\\n## Page 50', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 5, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667300', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 50\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nasset class type, as prescribed by the OSFI rules. These risk parameters are determined using internal models that leverage historical portfolio dat a\\nsupplemented by benchmarking, as appropriate, and are updated periodically. Validation procedures related to these models are in place in order toquantify and differentiate risks appropriately. The FIRB Approach employs the same internal PD estimates as the AIRB Approach, but LGD and EADparameters are prescribed by OSFI. Credit risk RWA related to certain Canadian and U.S. portfolios are determined under the Standardized Approachusing prescribed risk weights based on external ratings, counterparty type or product type. These portfolios reflect current waivers and exemption st o\\nthe IRB Approach approved by OSFI. For further discussion of these respective approaches noted above, refer to the Credit and Counterparty Risk –Credit and Counterparty Risk Measurement section.\\nWe use the Standardized Approach for determining market risk and operational risk capital requirements.In calculating regulatory capital ratios, total RWA must be increased when the capital floor amount calculated under the standardized approaches,\\nmultiplied by a capital floor adjustment factor, is higher than a similar calculation using the more risk-sensitive internal modelled approaches, w here\\napplicable. Other than during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the capital floor was not operative for BMO in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.\\nRegulatory Capital Developments\\nThe revised CAR Guideline, published by OSFI in October 2023, was effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and includes heightened regulatorycapital requirements for mortgages with growing balances where payments are insufficient to cover the interest component, as well as otherchanges that provide further clarification on the application of the guideline.\\nEffective November 1, 2023, the DSB was raised from 3.0% to 3.5% of total RWA.The domestic implementation of the Basel III Reforms related to market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, along with an increase in the\\ncapital floor adjustment from 65.0% to 67.5%, became effective the first quarter of fiscal 2024. On July 5, 2024, OSFI announced a one-year delay inthe next increase of the capital floor adjustment factor to allow OSFI time to consider the impact of the implementation of Basel III reforms in otherjurisdictions. With the one-year delay, the adjustment factor will remain at the current 67.5% for fiscal 2025 and will then rise by an additional 2.5%to 70.0% in fiscal 2026 and 72.5% in fiscal 2027.\\nThe Parental Stand-Alone (Solo) TLAC Framework for D-SIBs, published by OSFI on September 12, 2023, was effective in the first quarter of\\nfiscal 2024. The purpose of the Solo framework is to ensure a non-viable D-SIB has sufficient loss absorbing capacity on a stand-alone legal entitybasis to support its resolution, which would, in turn, facilitate an orderly resolution of the D-SIB while minimizing adverse impacts on the stabilit yo f\\nthe financial sector, ensuring the continuity of critical functions and minimizing taxpayers’ exposure to loss. We exceeded the minimum Solo TLACrequirement of 21.5%.\\nEffective the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17). Upon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily\\nchanged our accounting policy for the measurement of investment properties under IAS 40, Investment Properties (IAS 40), recorded in insurance-\\nrelated assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, from cost value to fair value. This change did not have a material impact on regulatory capitalratios. Refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section for further details.\\nRegulatory Capital and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity Review\\nBMO is well-capitalized, with capital ratios that exceed OSFI’s published requirements for large Canadian banks, including a DSB of 3.5%. OurCET1 Ratio was 13.6% as at October 31, 2024, compared with 12.5% as at October 31, 2023. Our CET1 Ratio increased from the prior year, primarily asa result of internal capital generation, common shares issued under the Shareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (DRIP) andlower source-currency RWA. There was a positive impact to the ratio from the reversal of a fiscal 2022 legal provision associated with a predecessorbank, M&I Marshal and Ilsley Bank, which increased internal capital generation and reduced RWA.\\nOur Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital Ratios were 15.4% and 17.6%, respectively, as at October 31, 2024, compared with 14.1% and 16.2%,\\nrespectively, as at October 31, 2023. The Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital Ratios were higher, due to the same factors impacting the CET1 Ratio, as wellas the issuances of Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCN) totalling US$1.75 billion, partially offset by preferred share redemptions.\\nThe impact of foreign exchange movements on BMO’s capital ratios was largely offset. BMO’s investments in foreign operations are primarily\\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, and the foreign exchange impact of U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA and capital deductions may result in variability in thebank’s capital ratios. We manage the impact of foreign exchange movements on RWA and capital deductions in our capital ratios.\\nOur Leverage Ratio was 4.4% as at October 31, 2024, an increase from 4.2% as at October 31, 2023, driven by higher Tier 1 Capital, partially\\noffset by higher leverage exposures.\\nAs at October 31, 2024, our TLAC Ratio was 29.3% and our TLAC Leverage Ratio was 8.3%, compared with 27.0% and 8.1%, respectively, as at\\nOctober 31, 2023.\\nWhile the ratios discussed above reflect our consolidated capital base, we conduct business through a variety of corporate structures, including\\nsubsidiaries. A framework is in place such that capital and funding are managed appropriately at the subsidiary level.\\nFollowing the acquisition of Bank of the West in fiscal 2023, our U.S. bank intermediate holding company BMO Financial Corp. (BFC) became a\\nCategory III institution under the Enhanced Prudential Standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). BFC is required to meet certainheightened regulatory standards related to capital, liquidity and risk management, including complying with FRB single counterparty credit limit s. BFC\\nis also subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST) requirements of the FRB on an\\nannual basis.\\nOn June 26, 2024, the FRB released its 2024 CCAR and DFAST results, and on August 28, 2024 announced individual large bank capital\\nrequirements, which were effective October 1, 2024. For BFC, the FRB determined a CET1 Ratio requirement of 10.0%, including the 4.5% minimumCET1 Ratio and a 5.5% stress capital buffer. BFC is well-capitalized, with a CET1 Ratio of 11.8% as at September 30, 2024.\\n62BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 51\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Regulatory Capital and TLAC(1)\\nTABLE 30\\n(Canadian $ in millions, except as noted)\\nAs at October 31 2024 2023\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital: Instruments and Reserves\\nDirectly issued qualifying common share capital plus related stock surplus 24,275 23,269\\nRetained earnings 46,469 44,920\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (and other reserves) 5,419 1,862\\nGoodwill and other intangibles (net of related tax liability) (20,349) (20,899)\\nOther common equity Tier 1 capital deductions 1,240 3,762\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) 57,054 52,914\\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital: Instruments\\nDirectly issued qualifying Additional Tier 1 instruments plus related stock surplus 7,787 6,958\\nTotal regulatory adjustments applied to Additional Tier 1 Capital (106) (87)\\nAdditional Tier 1 Capital (AT1) 7,681 6,871\\nTier 1 Capital (T1 = CET1 + AT1) 64,735 59,785\\nTier 2 Capital: Instruments and Provisions\\nDirectly issued qualifying Tier 2 instruments plus related stock surplus 8,230 8,082\\nGeneral allowance 954 902\\nTotal regulatory adjustments to Tier 2 Capital (8) (51)\\nTier 2 Capital (T2) 9,176 8,933\\nTotal Capital (TC = T1 + T2) 73,911 68,718\\nNon-Regulatory Capital Elements of TLAC\\nDirectly issued qualifying Other TLAC instruments 49,465 45,773\\nTotal regulatory adjustments applied to Other TLAC (88) (89)\\nOther TLAC 49,377 45,684\\nTLAC (TLAC = TC + Other TLAC) 123,288 114,402\\nRisk-Weighted Assets and Leverage Ratio Exposures\\nRisk-Weighted Assets 420,838 424,197\\nLeverage Ratio Exposures 1,484,962 1,413,036\\nCapital Ratios (%)\\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio 13.6 12.5\\nTier 1 Capital Ratio 15.4 14.1\\nTotal Capital Ratio 17.6 16.2\\nTLAC Ratio 29.3 27.0\\nLeverage Ratio 4.4 4.2\\nTLAC Leverage Ratio 8.3 8.1\\n(1) Calculated in accordance with OSFI’s CAR Guideline and LR Guideline, as applicable.

Based on a floor price of $5.00, these NVCC instruments would be converted intoapproximately 4.2 billion BMO common shares, assuming no accrued interest and no declared and unpaid dividends.\\nFurther details on subordinated debt and share capital are provided in Notes 16 and 17 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nDividends\\nDividends per common share declared in fiscal 2024 totalled $6.12, an increase of 6% from the prior year. Annual dividends declaredrepresented 64% of reported net income and 63% of adjusted net income available to common shareholders on a last twelve-month basis.\\nOur target dividend payout range (common share dividends as a percentage of net income available to shareholders, less preferred share\\ndividends and distributions on other equity instruments, based on earnings over the last twelve months) is 40% to 50%, providing shareholders witha competitive dividend yield. Our target dividend payout range seeks to provide shareholders with stable income, while retaining sufficient earnin gs\\nto support anticipated business growth, fund strategic investments and support capital adequacy.\\nAt year-end, our common shares provided an annualized dividend yield of 5% based on the year-end closing share price. On December 5, 2024,\\nwe announced that the Board of Directors had declared a quarterly dividend on common shares of $1.59 per share, an increase of $0.04 per sharefrom the prior quarter and 5% from the prior year. The dividend is payable on February 26, 2025 to shareholders of record on January 30, 2025.\\nShareholder Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan\\nCommon shareholders may elect to have their cash dividends reinvested in common shares of BMO, in accordance with the DRIP.\\nIn the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024, common shares to supply the DRIP were issued from treasury at a 2% discount, calculated in\\naccordance with the terms of the DRIP. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, and until further notice, common shares to supply the DRIP will bepurchased on the open market without a discount. During fiscal 2023, common shares to supply the DRIP were issued from treasury at a 2% discount,calculated in accordance with the terms of the DRIP.\\nEligible Dividends Designation\\nFor the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) or any similar provincial and territorial legislation, BMO designates all dividends paid or deemed to\\nbe paid on both its common and preferred shares as “eligible dividends”, unless indicated otherwise.\\nCautionThis Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Sta tements.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nWe enter into a number of off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations, and these include structured entities (SEs), credit\\ninstruments and guarantees.\\nStructured Entities and Securitization\\nWe carry out certain business activities through arrangements involving SEs, using them to obtain sources of liquidity and manage capital bysecuritizing certain of our financial assets, to secure customer transactions, or to pass our credit risk exposure to holders of the vehicles’ securi ties. For\\nexample, we enter into transactions with SEs in which we transfer assets, including mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans,real estate lines of credit, auto loans and equipment loans, in order to obtain alternate sources of funding or as part of our trading activities. Note 6 of\\nthe audited annual consolidated financial statements describes the loan securitization activities carried out through third-party programs such as the\\nCanada Mortgage Bond Program and the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities Program. Note 7 of the audited annual consolidatedfinancial statements provides further details of our interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs. Under IFRS, we consolidate a SE if wecontrol the entity. We consolidate our own securitization vehicles, certain capital and funding vehicles, and other structured entities created to meet\\nour customers’ needs, as well as our own. We do not consolidate our customer securitization vehicles, certain capital vehicles, various BMO-managedfunds or various other SEs where investments are held. Further details on our customer securitization vehicles are provided below.\\nBMO-Sponsored Securitization Vehicles\\nWe sponsor various vehicles that fund assets originated either by us (which are then securitized through a bank securitization vehicle) or by ourcustomers (which are then securitized through three Canadian customer securitization vehicles and one U.S. customer securitization vehicle). We e arn\\nfees for providing services related to these customer securitization vehicles, including liquidity, distribution and financial arrangement fees for\\nsupporting the ongoing operations of the vehicles. These fees totalled approximately $160 million in fiscal 2024 ($149 million in fiscal 2023).\\nCustomer Securitization Vehicles\\nOur customer securitization vehicles provide customers with access to financing either from us or from the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP)markets. Customers sell either their assets or an interest in their assets into these vehicles, which then issue ABCP either to investors or to us, inorder to fund the purchases. The sellers remain responsible for servicing the transferred assets and are first to absorb any losses realized on thoseassets. We are not responsible for servicing or absorbing the first loss and none of the sellers are affiliated with BMO.\\nOur exposure to potential losses arises from the purchase of ABCP issued by the vehicles, any related derivative contracts entered into with the\\nvehicles, and the liquidity support provided to the market-funded vehicles. We use the credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enter intothese arrangements, just as we do when extending credit in the form of a loan.\\n66BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 55\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Three of these customer securitization vehicles are market-funded, while the fourth is funded directly by the bank. We do not control these\\nentities and therefore they are not consolidated. Further information on the consolidation of customer securitization vehicles is provided in Note 7o f\\nthe audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe market-funded vehicles had a total of $11.2 billion of ABCP outstanding as at October 31, 2024 ($12.2 billion as at October 31, 2023). The\\nABCP issued by the Canadian market-funded vehicles is rated R-1 (high) by DBRS and P1 by Moody’s, and the ABCP issued by the U.S. market-fundedvehicle is rated A1 by S&P and P1 by Moody’s. Our holdings of ABCP, as distributing agent of ABCP issued by the market-funded vehicles,totalled $170 million as at October 31, 2024 ($518 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nWe provide liquidity facilities to the market-funded vehicles, which may require that we provide additional financing to the vehicles should\\ncertain events occur. The total committed and undrawn amount under these liquidity facilities and the undrawn amount of the BMO funded vehiclesas at October 31, 2024 totalled $19.3 billion ($19.8 billion as at October 31, 2023). This amount comprises part of the commitments outlined inNote 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe assets of each of these market-funded vehicles consist primarily of exposures to diversified pools of automobile-related receivables and\\nconventional residential mortgages in Canada, and automobile-related receivables and equipment loans in the United States. These two asset classe s\\nrepresent 67% (63% in fiscal 2023) in Canada, and 86% (unchanged from 2023) in the United States, of the aggregate assets of their respectivevehicles as at October 31, 2024, and as at October 31, 2023, respectively.\\nGuarantees and Other Credit Instruments\\nTo meet the financial needs of our clients, we use a variety of guarantees and commitments. Guarantees include contracts under which we may berequired to make payments to a counterparty based on changes in the value of an asset, liability or equity security that the counterparty holds.Contracts under which we may be required to make payments if a third party does not perform according to the terms of a contract, and contractsunder which we provide indirect guarantees of indebtedness, are also considered guarantees. In the normal course of business, the types ofguarantee products we offer include letters of credit, derivatives contracts or instruments (including, but not limited to, credit default swaps), as well\\nas indemnification agreements. The maximum amount payable by BMO in relation to these guarantees was $47 billion as at October 31, 2024($40 billion as at October 31, 2023).\\nOther credit commitments are off-balance sheet arrangements that represent our commitment to customers to grant them credit in the form of\\nloans or other financings for specific amounts and maturities, subject to certain conditions. These include backstop liquidity facilities, docume ntary and\\ncommercial letters of credit, and commitments to extend credit. The maximum amount payable by BMO in relation to these other creditcommitments was $261 billion as at October 31, 2024 ($249 billion as at October 31, 2023).\\nThere is a large number of credit instruments outstanding at any time. The amount above is not representative of our likely credit exposure or\\nthe liquidity requirements for these instruments, as it does not take into account customer behaviour, which suggests that only a portion of ourcustomers would utilize the facilities related to these instruments, nor does it take into account any amounts that could be recovered under recourseand collateral provisions. Our customers are broadly diversified, and we do not anticipate events or conditions that would cause a significant numbe r\\nof customers to fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We use the credit adjudication process in deciding whether to enterinto these arrangements, just as we do when extending credit in the form of a loan. We monitor off-balance sheet credit instruments in order toavoid undue concentrations in any geographic region or industry.\\nFor the credit commitments outlined in the preceding paragraphs, in the absence of an event that triggers a default, early termination by BMO\\nmay result in a breach of contract.\\nFurther information on these instruments can be found in Note 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nCautionThis Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section contains forward-looking statements.

A disciplined and integratedapproach to managing risk is fundamental to the success of our operations. Our risk management framework providesindependent risk oversight across the enterprise and is integral to building competitive advantage.\\nEnterprise-Wide Risk Management outlines BMO’s approach to managing the key financial risks and other related risks that are inherent in these\\nbusiness activities, as discussed in the following sections:\\n68 Risks That May Affect Future Results\\n72 Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework77 Credit and Counterparty Risk85 Market Risk90 Insurance Risk91 Liquidity and Funding Risk100 Operational Non-Financial Risk\\n104 Legal and Regulatory Risk107 Strategic Risk107 Environmental and Social Risk109 Reputation Risk\\nText and tables presented in a blue-tinted font in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section of the MD&A form an integral part of the 2024 audited ann ual consolidated\\nfinancial statements. They present required disclosures as set out by the International Accounting Standards Board in IFRS 7, Financial Instruments – Disclosures, which\\npermits cross-referencing between the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the MD&A. Refer to Notes 1 and 5 of the audited annual consol idated financial\\nstatements.\\nRisks That May Affect Future Results\\nTop and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results\\nBMO’s overall risk profile can be impacted by evolving internal and external events. These events have the potential to affect our business and our\\noperational and financial results. Our risk management life cycle is a continuous process designed to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report o n\\nrisks arising from these events. These event-related risks are raised for discussion with the Board of Directors, senior management and businessleaders at several forums, incorporating both bottom-up and top-down approaches. Risks are examined and assessed by scenario analysis. Ourexposure to certain events is addressed through action plans developed based on these risk assessments.\\nThe following risks are considered to have the potential to materially impact BMO’s financial results, operational efficiency, strategic directio n\\nor reputation.\\nGeneral Economic Conditions\\nThe prevailing economic conditions in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business affect our financial results an d\\nbusiness operations. These conditions include the level of economic growth, interest rates and central bank actions, inflation, labour markets andunemployment rates, and the activity level and volatility of financial markets. The Canadian economy lost momentum in fiscal 2024, in response tohigher interest rates, but has shown continued resilience as a result of high levels of household savings, expansionary fiscal policies, and robustpopulation growth driven by immigration. Changes to Canada’s immigration policies are expected to slow population growth. Although the labourmarket has weakened in both countries, employment growth remains positive. Inflation has moderated, although some price pressures in theservices sector persist. The inflation rate has continued to moderate after reaching a four-decade high in fiscal 2022 in response to weaker labourmarkets, lower commodity prices and improved global supply chains. Policy rates are easing in Canada and the United States; however, longer-termborrowing costs, though falling, remain elevated. With the upcoming renegotiation of the Canada-United States-Mexico Trade Agreement in 2026,there is a risk that the free trade agreement may end, which could result in disruptive and costly tariffs on trade flows among the three nations.These factors represent risks for market stability and economic growth. Changes in economic conditions can affect consumer spending, housingprices, business investment and capital markets activity, and in turn, affect our business, including the demand for our lending and deposit product s,\\nnet interest income, fee revenue, operating expenses, credit losses and asset values. In fiscal 2024, the above factors had, and may continue to have,an impact on consumers and the operations of our clients, as well as a negative effect on our earnings, including lower loan and deposit demand, andhigher provisions for credit losses.\\nManagement regularly monitors the economic environment in which we operate, in order to identify significant changes in key economic\\nindicators, so that we can assess BMO’s portfolio and business strategies, and develop contingency plans to address any adverse developments.\\n68BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 57', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 6, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667311', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 57\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Cyber and Information Security Risk\\nCyber and information security risk arises from the ever-increasing reliance of our business operations on internet and cloud technologies, anddependence on advanced digital technologies to process data, combined with a hybrid work environment. In addition, rising geopolitical tensions ar e\\ncontributing to increasing global exposures to cyber security risks. These risks could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of BM O’s data\\nand information across our businesses and customer base. We are the target of attempted cyber attacks and must continuously monitor and developour systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure, as well as access to and the security of our data. Any resulti ng\\ndata breaches may lead to exposure or loss of data, including customer or employee information and the bank’s strategic or other sensitive internalinformation, and could result in identity theft, fraud or business losses. Cyber attacks could result in system failures and disruption of services, and\\nexpose the bank to litigation and regulatory risk, as well as reputational harm. Threat campaigns are becoming more sophisticated and well-organized, and often take place through third-party suppliers, which can negatively impact our business, brand and reputation, as well as customerretention and acquisition.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s cyber and information security program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nTechnology Resilience and Innovation Risk\\nTechnology resilience risk arises from a failure to maintain acceptable service levels during, as well as after, severe disruptions to critical proc esses\\nand the supporting information technology systems. Technology resilience risk exposure is increasing and driving new and more extensive regulator y\\nobligations and customer expectations related to operational resilience. This exposure challenges banks to extend their programs beyond disasterrecovery and business continuity activities, to include responses to internal and external threats of disruption. Technology resilience is critic al to\\nproviding our customers with a consistent online experience across our digital channels. Given the increasing reliance of our customers on technolo gy\\nplatforms to manage and support their personal, business and investment banking activities, it is important that we maintain platforms that functio n\\nat high levels of operational reliability and resilience, in order to protect and ensure the availability, integrity and recoverability of critical data,\\nparticularly with respect to business-critical systems.\\nTechnologies continue to evolve rapidly and are creating competitive pressures across the industry. Innovation risk is the inability to deliver new\\ntechnology solutions, services, processes and products that keep pace with rapidly evolving customer expectation and new competitors withoutdisruption to business-critical systems. New technologies may also lead to more complex regulatory, strategic and reputation risks. In alignment w ith\\nour Digital First strategy, we continue to invest in emerging technologies and talent to adapt to the dynamic environment and deliver competitiveand digitally-enabled products and services to meet our customers’ expectations for personalized and on-demand banking, pursue new businessgrowth opportunities and improve operational efficiency. We remain committed to the prudent and responsible adoption of new technologies.\\nIn alignment with BMO’s Digital First strategy, we continue to invest in risk management technology that can also enhance the customer\\nexperience, streamline processes and reduce complexity.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s technology risk program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nThird-Party Risk\\nOur use of third-party relationships continues to evolve and expand, helping us to deliver new and innovative solutions across the bank and for ourclients. While third-party relationships can be beneficial for the bank, they can give rise to risks that may threaten BMO’s operational resilience, such\\nas compromising customer data or disrupting the availability of critical products and services, which may financially impact the bank. We continue t o\\nenhance and evolve our capabilities in order to maintain effective third-party risk management and oversight and the efficient delivery of productsand services that depend on third parties.\\nFor further discussion of BMO’s third-party risk program, refer to the Operational Non-Financial Risk section.\\nGeopolitical Risk and Escalating Trade Disputes\\nGeopolitical uncertainty and conflicts between countries impact global economies and may lead to market volatility. The Russia-Ukraine conflict h as\\nhad an ongoing global impact, including higher energy prices and the erosion of business confidence. The financial, energy and technology sanctionsimposed on Russia by Ukraine’s allies could lead to long-term political, economic and military turmoil between Western countries and Russia.\\nThe Middle East conflict has heightened tensions significantly in the region, and the potential for escalation could drive up energy prices, unsettl e\\nfinancial markets and slow global growth even further, which would have a direct and indirect impact on our customers.\\nCanadian and U.S. relations with China remain strained, involving trade disputes and tensions over Taiwan. The political climate in the United\\nStates could lead to a new wave of tariffs, and a U.S. commitment to expanding trade ties with Taiwan may further elevate the tension. In addition,the strategic competition between the United States and China is driving greater global fragmentation, as both countries seek to reinforce theirautonomy, limit any vulnerabilities and insulate their technology sectors. This could adversely affect business investment and prove especiallyproblematic for commodity-producing countries such as Canada that rely on a large export market. Ongoing Canada-China disputes over politicalinterference are further evidence of this discord.\\nDiplomatic relations between Canada and India have also deteriorated, which could threaten to disrupt trade flows, tourism and immigration\\nbetween the two countries.\\nWe actively monitor global and North American events and trends, and continually assess our businesses in the context of these events and\\ntrends. Although our lending portfolio has limited direct exposure outside North America, our customers rely on global trade and sustained economicgrowth. To mitigate exposure to geopolitical risk, we maintain a diversified portfolio that we continually monitor, in addition to contingency plan s\\nthat are intended to prepare BMO for possible adverse developments. Our portfolios, business plans and capital adequacy are stress tested againstseverely adverse scenarios arising from trade-related shocks, and we build contingency plans and mitigation strategies aimed at addressing andoffsetting the consequences of possible adverse political and economic developments.\\nBMO’s credit exposure by geographic region is set out in Tables 67 to 73 in the Supplemental Information and in Note 4 of the audited annual\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 69\\n\\n\\n## Page 58\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk, including Climate Change\\nBMO is exposed to environmental and social risks, in particular climate risk related to environmental conditions and extreme weather events thatcould potentially disrupt our operations, impact our customers and counterparties, and result in lower earnings or potential losses. Factors contr ibuting\\nto heightened environmental risks include the impacts of climate change and the continued intensification of development in areas of greaterenvironmental sensitivity. Business continuity and disaster recovery plans provide us with the roadmap and tools to support the restoration,maintenance and management of critical operations and processes in the event of a business disruption.\\nWe are also exposed to risks related to borrowers that may experience financial losses or rising operating costs as a result of acute or chronic\\nchanges in climate conditions, climate-related litigation and/or policies, such as carbon emissions pricing, or a decline in revenue as new andemerging technologies and changing consumer preferences disrupt or displace demand for certain commodities, products and services. BMO’s climateambition is to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world. Our strategy seeks to capture commercialization opportunities byworking with our clients on their decarbonization journeys.\\nLegal and regulatory risk or reputation risk could arise from actual or perceived actions, or inaction, by our operations and those of our customers\\nin relation to climate change and other environmental and social risk issues, or our disclosures related to these matters. Risks related to these issu es\\ncould also affect our customers, suppliers or other interested parties, which could give rise to new risks. Globally, new and more stringent climate-related obligations are being developed, which may increase compliance requirements. Litigation or enforcement measures could arise from theseobligations to manage and report on climate-related risks.\\nRefer to the Environmental and Social Risk section for further discussion of these risks.\\nCanadian Housing Market and Consumer Leverage\\nElevated household debt continues to be a headwind for household spending and broader economic activity. The combination of still restrictiveinterest rate policy that results in higher mortgage payments at renewal and rising unemployment could further increase credit losses, particularl yi n\\nunsecured consumer credit. While recent and expected rate reductions by the Bank of Canada are alleviating pressure on Canadian households, thehousing market recovery will likely be constrained by the persistent lack of affordability, notably in Ontario and British Columbia, which could lim it\\nmortgage origination volumes. The risk of credit losses in our mortgage portfolio is in part mitigated by low loan-to-value and prudent underwritingpractices that stress test customers’ ability to service mortgage debt at higher interest rates. While portfolio stress test analysis suggests that even\\nsignificant price declines and challenging economic conditions would result in manageable losses, primarily due to insurance coverage and thelevel of equity held by owners with seasoned loans, delinquencies and insolvencies in our portfolio could adversely affect our results andfinancial condition. In addition, consumer loan losses could rise if unexpected economic weakness results in a significant further increase in theunemployment rate.\\nRegulatory Environment and Changes\\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated, and BMO has experienced increasing complexity in regulatory requirements and expectations, a s\\ngovernments and regulators around the world continue to pursue major reforms intended to strengthen the stability of the financial system andprotect key markets and participants. These reforms may lead to further increases in regulatory capital or liquidity requirements and additionalcompliance costs, which could lower returns and affect growth. Such reforms could also affect the cost and availability of funding and the level of thebank’s market-making activities. Regulatory reforms may also impact fees and other revenues for certain operating groups. In addition, difference si n\\nthe laws and regulations enacted by a range of national regulatory authorities may offer advantages to our international competitors, which couldaffect our ability to compete. We monitor such developments, and other potential changes, so that we are well-positioned to respond and implementany necessary changes. BMO is subject to legal proceedings, including investigations by regulators. Failure to comply with applicable legal andregulatory requirements and expectations could result in further legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions and fines, enforceme nt\\nactions, criminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in invest or and\\ncustomer confidence, and damage to our reputation.\\nRefer to the Legal and Regulatory Risk section for further discussion of these risks.\\nOther Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nFiscal and Monetary Policies and Other Economic Conditions in the Countries in which BMO Conducts BusinessFiscal and monetary policies and other economic conditions prevailing in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do businessmay impact profitability and heighten economic uncertainty in specific businesses and markets, which may in turn affect our customers andcounterparties, reduce profitability and contribute to a greater risk of credit losses. Levels of business debt remain elevated due to the residual e ffects\\nof the pandemic and the loss of governmental supports, which could impact our markets and our operating results. Interest rate fluctuations couldhave an impact on our earnings, the value of our investments, the credit quality of our loans to customers and counterparty exposure, as well as thecapital markets that we access.\\nFluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to other currencies have affected, and could continue to affect, the business operations\\nand results of clients with significant earnings or input costs denominated in foreign currencies. Our investments in operations outside of Canada a re\\nprimarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and the foreign exchange impact on our U.S.-dollar-denominated risk-weighted assets and capital deduction s\\nmay result in variability in our capital ratios. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section for further discussion of these risks. The v alue\\nof the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar will also affect the contribution of U.S. operations to Canadian-dollar profitability.\\nHedging positions may be taken to manage interest rate exposures and foreign exchange impacts, and to partially offset the effects of Canadian\\ndollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations on the bank’s financial results.\\nRefer to the 2024 Financial Performance Review – Foreign Exchange section and the Market Risk section for a more complete discussion of our\\nexposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.\\n70BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 59\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Tax Legislation and Interpretations\\nLegislative changes and changes in tax policy, including their interpretation by tax authorities and the courts, may impact earnings. Tax laws, as we ll\\nas interpretations of tax laws and policy by tax authorities, may change as a result of efforts by the Canadian and U.S. federal governments, other G20governments and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to increase taxes, broaden the tax base globally and improvetax-related reporting. For example, in fiscal 2024, the Canadian government enacted legislation to adopt the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BaseErosion and Profit Shifting two-pillar plan (Pillar 2) for international tax reform, which will levy a 15% minimum tax on operations globally.\\nFor further discussion, refer to the Future Changes in Accounting Policies – IAS-12, Income Taxes section.\\nChanges to Business Portfolio\\nAs part of its overall business strategy, BMO may acquire companies, businesses and assets. Although we conduct thorough due diligence beforecompleting these acquisitions, some acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our financial or strategic objectives or expectations. We may b e\\nsubject to regulatory and shareholder approvals to successfully complete an acquisition, and it may not be feasible to establish when, if or on whatterms the necessary approvals will be granted. Changes in the competitive and economic environment, as well as other factors, may result in adecline in revenue or profitability, while higher than anticipated integration costs and failure to realize anticipated cost savings after an acqui sition\\ncould also adversely affect earnings. Integration costs may increase because of regulatory costs related to an acquisition, operational loss event s,\\nother unanticipated expenses that were not identified in the due diligence process or demands on management time that are more significant thananticipated, as well as unexpected delays in implementing certain plans that may, in turn, lead to delays in achieving full integration. Successful p ost-\\nacquisition performance depends on retaining the clients and key employees of acquired companies and businesses and on integrating key systemsand processes without disruption.\\nBMO also evaluates potential dispositions of assets and businesses that may no longer meet strategic and financial objectives. When we seek to\\nsell assets or dispose of a business, we may have difficulty obtaining buyers or devising alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms or in a timel y\\nmanner, which could delay the achievement of strategic objectives. We may also dispose of assets or a business on terms that are less favourablethan anticipated or lead to adverse operational or financial impacts, or greater disruption than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on reven ue\\ngrowth may be greater than forecast. Dispositions may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions and the granting of governmental or regulatoryapprovals on acceptable terms that, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent the completion of a disposition as intended, or at all.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates, Judgments and Accounting Standards\\nBMO prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Changes that the International Accounting Standards Board makes fromtime to time may materially affect the way we record and report financial results. Future changes in accounting policies are discussed in the FutureChanges in Accounting Policies section, as well as in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe application of IFRS requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and\\nliabilities, certain amounts reported in net income and other related disclosures. In making these judgments and estimates, we rely on the bestinformation available at the time. However, it is possible that circumstances may change, new information may become available or models mayprove to be imprecise.\\nBMO’s financial results could be affected for the period during which any such new information or change in circumstances becomes apparent,\\nand the extent of the impact could be significant. More information is included in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section.\\nCautionThe Risks That May Affect Future Results section and the remainder of this Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section contain forward-looking stateme nts.

Our Enterprise Risk and Portfolio\\nManagement (ERPM) group oversees the implementation and operation of the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework (ERMF), and providesindependent review and oversight across the enterprise on risk-related issues, in order to enable prudent and measured risk-taking that is integrat ed\\nwith business strategy. All elements of the ERMF function together to support informed and effective risk management, while striking an appropriatebalance between risk and return.\\nThe ERMF guides our risk-taking activities in order to align them with customer needs, shareholder expectations and regulatory requirements. We\\nhave established a risk governance framework as part of the ERMF that serves as the foundation for consistent and effective management of risksfacing the bank, outlining our approach to understanding and managing risk, protecting BMO’s reputation, diversifying and limiting potential tail risk,\\nmaintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, and optimizing risk return. In addition, the ERMF defines roles and responsibilities across al l three\\nlines of defence. It incorporates our Risk Management Life Cycle and informs our efforts to identify, assess, manage (which includes mitigation),monitor and report on our exposure to material risks. The ERMF is driven by our people, processes and technology, along with a range of riskmanagement tools, including modelling and analytics, stress testing and scenario analysis, and our Risk Taxonomy. All elements of the ERMF aresupported by our risk culture and provide for direct management of each individual risk type, as well as the management of risk on an integratedbasis.\\nRisk Management Tools\\n(e.g.: Stress Testing, Scenario Analysis, Modelling, Analytics)Enterprise Risk Management Framework\\nRisk Culture\\n\\x81 Tone from the top\\n\\x81 Accountability\\x81 Effective communication and challenge\\n\\x81 IncentivesRisk Management EnablementIDENTIFY ASSESS MANAGE MONITOR REPORT Risk Management Life Cycle\\nRisk Taxonomy \\x81 Credit & Counterparty\\n\\x81 Market\\x81 Liquidity & Funding\\n\\x81 Insurance\\x81 Non-Financial**\\n\\x81 Reputation\\x81\\n\\x81Risk Governance\\nBoard\\n(RRC*, ACRC*)\\nSenior Management\\n(RMC*, ERC* & Management Committees*)\\nRisk Appetite Framework\\nPolicy Framework\\n1st Line\\nOperating Groups, Technology &\\nOperations, Corporate Services2nd Line\\nEnterprise Risk & Portfolio Management,\\nLegal & Regulatory Compliance3rd Line\\nCorporate Audit \\nDivisionRisk Management Approach Maintain strong capital and liquidity Diversify; limit tail risk Optimize risk return Understand and manage Protect our reputation\\nPeople - Process - Technology\\nRisk Governance\\nThe ERMF outlines a governance approach that includes robust Board of Directors and senior management oversight, a Risk Appetite Framework, the\\nEnterprise Policy Framework and the corresponding roles in the three-lines-of-defence operating model.\\nBoard of Directors and Senior Management Oversight\\nSpecific policies approved by our Board of Directors govern our approach to the management of material risks, and oversight is exercised at everylevel of the enterprise through a hierarchy of committees and individual responsibilities, as outlined in the following diagram. The Board of Direct ors\\nseeks to ensure that corporate objectives are supported by a sound risk strategy, prudent risk appetite and an effective ERMF that is appropriate tothe nature, scale, complexity and risk profile of our lines of business and other operations. The Board also has overall responsibility for oversight of\\nthe bank’s governance framework and corporate culture. Senior management reviews and discusses significant risk issues and action plans as theyarise in the implementation of the enterprise-wide strategy, exercising oversight and governance of the risks taken across the enterprise and theprocesses through which exposures to such risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported on, in accordance with policies, and heldwithin approved limits and risk tolerances.\\nThe ERMF is reviewed on a regular basis by the Risk Review Committee (RRC) of the Board of Directors, in order to exercise oversight and guide\\nrisk-taking activities.\\n72BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 61\\n\\n                          MD&A                          \\n(2) Co-chaired by the Chief Finan cial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.\\n(3) Chaired by the Chief Risk Officer.\\n(4) Chaired by the General Counsel.(5) Co-chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.(6) Co-chaired by the General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.Board/BoardCommittees\\nManagement\\nCommitteesBoard & Senior Management Oversight (1)\\nBoard of Directors\\nRisk Review Committee\\n(RRC)Audit and Conduct Review\\nCommittee (ACRC)\\nRisk Management\\nCommittee (RMC) (3)Reputation Risk Management\\nCommittee (RRMC) (4)Asset Liability\\nCommittee (ALCO) (5)Enterprise Regulatory \\nCommittee (ERC) (6)Enterprise Capital\\nManagement\\nCommittee (ECMC) (2)\\n(1) Reporting relationships shown in dotted lines, sub-committees shown as solid lines.\\nIn addition to the oversight exercised by the Board of Directors and senior management, effective governance of the bank’s risks is overseen by\\nmanagement committees and supported by the three-lines-of-defence operating model, which addresses risks across the operating groups andCorporate Services.\\nBoard of Directors is responsible for supervising the management\\nof the business and affairs of BMO. The Board, either directly orthrough its committees, is responsible for oversight of the followingareas: strategic planning; defining risk appetite; identifying andmanaging risk; managing capital; fostering a culture of integrity;internal controls; succession planning and evaluation of seniormanagement; communication; public disclosure; and corporategovernance.\\nRisk Review Committee (RRC) of the Board of Directors assists the\\nBoard in fulfilling its risk management oversight responsibilities.This includes overseeing a strong risk culture; overseeing theidentification, assessment and management of BMO’s risks;monitoring adherence to risk management corporate policies andcompliance with risk-related regulatory requirements; and evaluatingthe effectiveness of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), in conjunction withthe Human Resources Committee, including input into successionplanning for the CRO. The ERMF is reviewed at least annually by theRRC, and guides risk-taking activities and sets out the bank’sapproach to risk management.\\nAudit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Board of\\nDirectors assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilitiesfor the integrity of BMO’s financial reporting and sustainabilityreporting, including the effectiveness of BMO’s internal controls; theinternal audit function; the qualifications, independence andperformance of the independent auditors; BMO’s compliance withlaws and regulations; transactions involving related parties; conflictsof interest and confidential information; standards of businessconduct and ethics; cyber security; and consumer protectionmeasures and complaints.\\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) is directly accountable to the Board for\\nall of BMO’s risk-taking activities. The CEO is supported by the CROand the ERPM group.Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports directly to the CEO, is head of ERPM,\\nchair of RMC and reports to the RRC on risk-related matters. The CROis responsible for providing independent review and oversight ofenterprise-wide risks and leadership on risk issues, developing andmaintaining the ERMF and fostering a strong risk culture across theenterprise.\\nManagement Level Committees overseeing risk matters, including\\nthe Enterprise Capital Management Committee (ECMC), RiskManagement Committee (RMC), Reputation Risk ManagementCommittee (RRMC), Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) and EnterpriseRegulatory Committee (ERC), bring together senior executivemembers of BMO management to oversee risk management acrossthe enterprise. The committees are chaired by members of theExecutive Committee, exercising risk oversight and governance fortheir respective risks at the highest levels of management.\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM) , as the second\\nline of defence, provides risk management oversight, effectivechallenge and independent assessment of risk and risk-takingactivities. ERPM supports a disciplined approach to risk-taking byexercising its responsibility for independent transactional approvaland portfolio management, policy formulation, risk reporting, stresstesting, modelling and risk education. This approach promotesconsistency in risk management practices and standards across theenterprise, and verifies that any risks accepted are consistent withBMO’s risk appetite.\\nOperating Groups and Corporate Services , including Technology\\nand Operations, are responsible for effectively managing risks byidentifying, assessing, managing, monitoring, mitigating andreporting on exposures to risk within their respective operations andlines of business, in accordance with their established risk appetite.They exercise business judgment and maintain effective policies,processes and internal controls, so that significant risk issues areescalated and reviewed by ERPM. Individual governance committeesand ERPM establish and monitor risk limits that are consistent with,and subordinate to, the Board-approved limits.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 73\\n\\n\\n## Page 62\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nRisk Appetite Framework\\nWe believe that risk management is every employee’s responsibility. This is guided by five key principles that define our approach to managing risk\\nacross the enterprise and comprise our Risk Appetite:\\n‰Understand and Manage by only taking risks that are transparent and understood.\\n‰Protect BMO’s Reputation by adhering to principles of honesty, integrity, respect and high ethical standards, in line with our Code of Conduct.\\n‰Diversify. Limit Tail Risk by targeting a business mix that minimizes earnings volatility and exposure to low-probability, high-impact events.\\n‰Maintain Strong Capital and Liquidity positions that meet, or exceed, regulatory requirements and market expectations.\\n‰Optimize Risk Return by managing risk-adjusted exposures and making decisions that create value for shareholders.\\nOur Risk Appetite Framework consists of a Risk Appetite Statement, risk limits and an outline of the responsibilities of the Board of Directors, its\\ncommittees and senior management. The Risk Appetite Statement incorporates a risk appetite, comprising both qualitative statements andquantitative measures (including risk limits), that indicates the aggregate level and types of risk that the bank is willing to assume in order to supp ort\\nsound business initiatives and drive appropriate returns and targeted growth. The risk appetite is integrated within our strategic and businessobjectives and our capital and liquidity plans, as well as the bank’s recovery and resolution plans. Our risk appetite is established by following theRisk Appetite Framework principles, supported by corporate policies, standards and guidelines, as well as committee mandates, and is developed tomeet regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. The Risk Appetite Framework assists senior management and the Board ofDirectors in assessing the bank’s risk profile against our risk appetite. Both the Risk Appetite Framework and Risk Appetite Statement are reviewedand approved by the Board of Directors annually. Our risk appetite is articulated and applied consistently across the enterprise, with operating gro ups,\\nkey businesses and entities developing their own respective risk appetite statements within this framework.\\nRisk Limits\\nRisk limits are set so that risk-taking activities remain within BMO’s risk appetite, balancing risk diversification, exposure to loss and risk-adj usted\\nreturns. These limits inform business strategies and decisions, and are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors or management or itscommittees, as appropriate, based on the level and granularity of the limits. They include:\\n‰Credit and Counterparty Risk – limits on group and single-name exposures and material country, industry and portfolio/product segments.\\n‰Market Risk – limits on economic value and earnings exposures to stress scenarios and significant market movements, as well as limits on value at\\nrisk and stress related to trading and underwriting activities.\\n‰Insurance Risk – limits on policy exposures and reinsurance arrangements.\\n‰Liquidity and Funding Risk – minimum limits governing the internal liquidity stress testing scenario, minimum regulatory liquidity ratio\\nrequirements, and maximum levels of asset pledging and wholesale funding, as well as limits related to liability diversification and exposure tocredit and liquidity facilities.\\n‰Operational Non-Financial Risk – key metrics for measuring operational and other non-financial risks that may have financial consequences.\\nThe Board of Directors, after considering recommendations from the RRC and RMC, annually reviews and approves key risk limits and then delegates\\noverall authority for these limits to the CEO. The CEO in turn delegates more specific authorities to the senior executives of the operating groups (fi rst\\nline of defence), who are responsible for the management of risk in their respective operations, and to the CRO. These delegated authorities allowrisk officers to set risk tolerances, approve geographic and industry sector exposure limits within defined parameters, and establish underwritin g and\\ninventory limits for trading and investment banking activities. The criteria under which more specific authorities may be delegated across theorganization, as well as the requirements relating to documentation, communication and monitoring of those specific delegated authorities, are se t\\nout in corporate policies and standards.\\nEnterprise Policy Framework\\nThe Enterprise Policy Framework includes a comprehensive set of risk-related corporate policies, each of which is approved by the RRC, ACRC or theBoard of Directors, as well as corporate standards issued pursuant to those corporate policies that have been reviewed by the RMC and approved bysenior management. Corporate policies and standards collectively outline the principles, expectations, and roles and responsibilities of seniormanagement for ensuring that exposures to key risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported. Corporate policies and standardsare reviewed and updated at a minimum every two years.\\nThe Enterprise Policy Framework also includes supporting directives and procedures that apply across the first and second lines of defence to\\noperationalize the requirements, roles and responsibilities, and frameworks outlined in those corporate policies and standards.\\n74BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 63', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 7, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667321', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 63\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Three-Lines-of-Defence Operating Model\\nOur ERMF is operationalized through the three-lines-of-defence approach to managing risk, as described below:\\n‰Operating groups and Corporate Services, which includes Technology and Operations, serve as our first line of defence. They are accountable for the\\nrisks arising from their businesses, operations and exposures. They are expected to pursue business opportunities within their established riskappetite and to identify, assess, manage (which includes mitigation), monitor and report on risks in, or arising from, their businesses, operationsand exposures. The first line fulfills its responsibilities by applying risk management and reporting methodologies, by establishing appropriateinternal controls in accordance with the ERMF, and by monitoring the effectiveness of such controls. These processes and controls serve as theframework for our lines of business to act within their delegated risk-taking authority and risk limits, as set out in corporate policies and the RiskAppetite Framework. Corporate Services, while part of our first line of defence, may also serve in a governance capacity when specific roles andresponsibilities are assigned to individuals or groups under the Enterprise Policy Framework. In such instances, governance accountabilities wil lb e\\ncarried out independent of the individuals or groups responsible for risk-taking.\\n‰The second line of defence comprises ERPM and Legal & Regulatory Compliance. The second line exercises independent oversight, performseffective challenge and provides independent assessment of risks and risk management practices, including transactions, product and portfolio ri sk\\nmanagement decisions, regulatory compliance, and processes and controls applied in the first line of defence. The second line establishesenterprise-wide risk management policies, frameworks, processes, methodologies and practices that the first and second lines use to identify,assess, manage (which includes mitigation), monitor and report on risks across the enterprise.\\n‰Corporate Audit Division is the third line of defence. It provides an independent assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls across theenterprise, including controls that support the risk management and governance processes, and reports its findings to the Board of Directors.\\nRisk Taxonomy\\nOur Risk Taxonomy categorizes the key risks to which BMO is exposed and p rovides a framework for the risk management life cycle in relation to\\neach of the key risks. Our Risk Taxonomy incorporates exposures to financ ial risks (Credit and Counterparty Risk, Market Risk, Insurance Risk and\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk), non-financial risks (Operational Non-Finan cial Risk and Legal and Regulatory Risk) and transverse risks, which inter sect\\nwith both financial and non-financial risks (Strategic Risk, Environment al and Social Risk and Reputation Risk ). We maintain sub-categories under\\neach Tier 1 risk to support effective risk management practices as part of the overall ERMF. Failure in managing these risks, or in controlling our\\nexposures to them, could have material financial consequences for BMO.\\nRisk Management Life Cycle\\nRisk Identification, Assessment and ManagementRisk identification is an integral step in recognizing the key inherent risks that BMO faces, assessing the potential for loss and then acting to\\nmitigate this potential. Our Risk Taxonomy documents the key risks, suppo rting the implementation of our Risk Appetite Framework and assisting in\\nidentifying the primary risk categories for which stress capital consumpti on is estimated. Risk review and approval processes are established base d\\non the nature, size and complexity of the risks involved. Generally, t hese involve a formal review and approval by either an individual or a\\ncommittee that is independent of the originator. Delegated a uthorities and approvals by category are outlined below.\\n‰Portfolio transactions – transactions are approved through risk assessment processes for all types of transactions at all levels of the enterprise,\\nwhich include operating group recommendations and ERPM approval of credit risk, and transactional and position limits for market risk.\\n‰Structured transactions – new structured products and transactions with significant legal and regulatory, accounting or tax implications are\\nreviewed by the Global Markets Risk Committee, as appropriate, and are also assessed under the operational risk management process if theyinvolve structural or operational complexity that may give rise to significant operational risk. Transactions that may give rise to significant orheightened reputation risk are reviewed by the Reputation Risk Management Committee.\\n‰Investment initiatives – documentation of risk assessments is formalized through the investment assessment and approval process, and is\\nreviewed and approved by Corporate Services based on the size of an initiative’s investment spending and its inherent risk.\\n‰New products and services – policies and procedures for the approval of new or modified products and services offered to customers are the\\nresponsibility of both the first and second lines of defence, including appropriate senior business leaders, and are reviewed and approved bysubject matter experts and senior management in Corporate Services, as well as by other senior management committees.\\nRisk Monitoring and Reporting\\nRisk-Based Capital AssessmentTwo measures of risk-based capital are used by BMO: economic capital and regulatory capital. Both are aggregate measures of the risk that the bankassumes in pursuit of its financial objectives, and enable the evaluation of returns on a risk-adjusted basis. Our operating model provides for thedirect management of each type of risk, as well as the management of material risks on an integrated basis. Measuring the economic profitability oftransactions or portfolios involves a combination of both expected and unexpected losses to assess the extent and correlation of risk beforeauthorizing new exposures. Both expected and unexpected loss measures for a current transaction or portfolio reflect current and future marketconditions, the inherent risk in the position and, as appropriate, its credit quality. Risk-based capital methods and material models are reviewed a t\\nleast annually and updated as appropriate. The risk-based capital models provide a forward-looking estimate of the difference between themaximum potential loss in economic (or market) value and expected loss, measured over a specified time interval and using a defined confidencelevel.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 75\\n\\n\\n## Page 64\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nStress Testing\\nStress testing is a key element of our risk management and capital management frameworks. It is integrated into our enterprise and group riskappetite statements and embedded in our management processes. To evaluate risks, we regularly test a range of scenarios, which vary in frequency,severity and complexity, in portfolios and businesses across the enterprise. In addition, we participate in regulatory stress tests in multiplejurisdictions.\\nQuantitative models and tools, along with qualitative evaluations, are utilized to assess the impact of changes in the macroeconomic\\nenvironment on the income statement and balance sheet and the resilience of the bank’s capital position over a forecast horizon. Models utilized forstress testing are approved and governed under the Model Risk Management Framework, and are used to establish a better understanding of ourrisks and to test our capital adequacy.\\nBMO’s stress testing framework integrates stress testing at the line of business, portfolio, industry, geographic and product level, and embeds\\nthe test results in strategy, business planning and decision-making. Targeted portfolio, industry and geographic analysis is conducted by ERPM andthe lines of business to test risk appetite, limits, concentration and strategy. Ad hoc stress testing is conducted in response to changing economic o r\\nmarket conditions and in order to assess business strategies.\\nEnterprise stress testing is conducted to support BMO’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and target-setting through analysis\\nof the potential effects of low-frequency, high-severity events on our earnings, our balance sheet, and our liquidity and capital positions. Scenar io\\nselection is a multi-step process that considers material and idiosyncratic risks and the potential impact of new or emerging trends on risk profiles ,a s\\nwell as on the macroeconomic environment. Scenarios may be defined by senior management or regulators. The economic impacts are determinedby the Economics group, which distills the scenarios into macroeconomic and market variables that include, but are not limited to, GDP growth, yieldcurve estimates, unemployment rates, real estate prices, stock index growth and changes in corporate profits. These macroeconomic variables drivestress loss models, tools and qualitative assessments that are applied to determine estimated stress impacts. The scenarios are used by operating,risk and finance groups to assess a broad range of financial impacts that BMO could experience as a result of a specific stress, as well as in theordinary course of business, and extraordinary actions anticipated in response to that stress.\\nGovernance of the stress testing framework resides with senior management, including the Enterprise Stress Testing Committee. This committee\\ncomprises business, risk and finance executives, and is accountable for reviewing and challenging enterprise-wide scenarios and stress test resul ts.\\nStress testing and enterprise-wide scenarios associated with the ICAAP, including recommendations for actions that the enterprise could take in or der\\nto manage the impact of a stress event, are established by senior management and presented to the Board of Directors. Oversight and governance ofthe stress testing associated with the Horizontal Capital Review (HCR), which is a U.S. regulatory requirement for BMO Financial Corp. (BFC), areexercised at the BFC level by its Board of Directors through its Risk Oversight and Capital Committee.\\nRefer to the Environmental and Social Risk section for a discussion of our climate scenario analysis program.\\nRisk Culture\\nRisk culture at BMO is the set of shared norms, attitudes and behaviours rela ted to risk awareness, risk-taking and risk management. Sound risk cultur e\\nis designed to support appropriate behaviours and judgments about risk-ta king, and promotes effective risk management and the alignment of risk-\\ntaking activities with BMO’s Risk Appetite. Our risk culture informs and su pports our overall organizational culture. We are committed to high ethic al\\nstandards, grounded in our values of integrity, empathy, diversity and r esponsibility. ERPM is responsible for the development and promotion of a\\nhealthy, strong risk culture across the enterprise. In pursuing this manda te, ERPM works closely with Legal & Regulatory Compliance and its Ethics Of fice,\\nas well as People & Culture. BMO’s risk culture is founded on four guiding prin ciples that together reinforce its effectiveness across the bank: Tone f rom\\nthe Top, Accountability, Effective Communication and Challenge, and Incentives.\\n‰Tone from the Top: Our risk culture is grounded in an approach to risk management that encourages openness, constructive challenge and\\npersonal accountability. Each member of senior management plays a critical role in fostering this strong risk culture among employees byeffectively communicating this responsibility and by the example of their actions. The Board of Directors oversees BMO’s corporate objectives andthe requirement that they be supported by a sound risk strategy and an effective ERMF that is appropriate to the nature, scale, complexity and riskprofile of our operations.\\n‰Accountability: BMO’s ERMF is anchored in the three-lines-of-defence approach to managing risk. Our risk culture also encourages the escalation of\\nconcerns associated with potential or emerging risks to senior management, so that those concerns can be appropriately evaluated and addressed.BMO encourages and supports an environment in which concerns can be raised without retaliation.\\n‰Effective Communication and Challenge: Timely and transparent sharing of information is integral to engaging business partners in key decisions\\nand strategy discussions, which brings added rigour and discipline to BMO’s decision-making. This not only leads to the timely identification,escalation and resolution of issues, but also encourages open communication, independent challenge and an understanding of the key risks facedby the organization, so that employees are equipped and empowered to make decisions and take action in a coordinated and consistent manner,supported by a strong and effective monitoring and control framework.\\n‰Incentives: Compensation and other incentives are aligned with prudent risk-taking. These are designed to reward the appropriate use of capital\\nand respect for the rules and principles of the ERMF, and to discourage excessive risk-taking. Risk managers have input into the design of incentiveprograms that may have an effect on risk-taking. We also maintain training programs that are designed to foster a deep understanding of BMO’scapital management and risk management frameworks across the enterprise, providing employees and management with the tools and insightsthey need to fulfill their responsibilities for independent oversight, regardless of their role in the organization.\\n76BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 65\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Credit and Counterparty Risk\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk is the potential for financial loss due to the failure of an obligor (i.e., a borrower, endorser, guarantor or counterparty)\\nto repay a loan or honour another predetermined financial obligation.\\nCredit and counterparty risk underlies every lending activity that we enter into, and also arises in the holding of investment securities, transacti ons\\nrelated to trading and other capital markets products, and activities related to securitization. Credit and counterparty risk represents the mostsignificant measurable risk we face. Effective management of credit and counterparty risk is integral to our success, since failure to do so could hav e\\nan immediate and significant impact on our earnings, financial condition and reputation.\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk Governance\\nThe Credit Risk Management Framework seeks to ensure that material credit risks to which the enterprise is exposed are identified, assessed,managed, monitored and reported on regularly. The Risk Review Committee (RRC) has oversight of the management of material risks that BMO faces,including the Credit Risk Management Framework. The framework incorporates governing principles that are defined in a series of corporate policiesand standards and are given effect through specific operating procedures. These policies and standards are reviewed on a regular basis and modifiedas necessary, so that they are current and consistent with our risk appetite. The structure, limits (both notional and capital-based), collateralrequirements, monitoring, reporting and ongoing management of credit and counterparty exposures are governed by these credit risk managementprinciples.\\nLending officers in the operating groups are responsible for recommending credit decisions based on the completion of appropriate due\\ndiligence, and they assume accountability for the related risks. In some instances, relatively small transactions may be assessed by an automateddecision-making process, or they may be approved by first-line underwriters with appropriate training, independence and oversight. Credit office rs in\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM) approve larger transactions or transactions involving greater risk and are accountable for provid ing\\nan objective independent assessment of the relevant lending recommendations and risks assumed by the lending officers. All of these individuals inthe first and second lines of defence are subject to a lending qualification process and operate in a disciplined environment with clear delegation ofdecision-making authority, including individually delegated lending limits where appropriate, which are reviewed annually or more frequently, a s\\nneeded. The Board of Directors annually delegates to the CEO discretionary lending limits for further specific delegation to senior officers. Credi t\\ndecision-making is conducted at the management level based on the size and risk of each transaction, in accordance with a range of corporatepolicies, standards and procedures governing the conduct of activities in which credit risk arises. Corporate Audit Division reviews and testsmanagement processes and controls and samples credit transactions in order to assess adherence to acceptable lending standards as set out inBMO’s Risk Appetite Statement, as well as compliance with applicable corporate policies, standards and procedures.\\nFor wholesale borrowers presenting a higher than normal risk of default, we have formal policies in place that outline the framework for\\nmanaging such accounts, as well as specialized groups that manage them, as appropriate. We strive to identify borrowers facing financial difficultyearly, and to return such accounts to an acceptable level of risk through the application of good business judgment and the implementation of soundand constructive workout solutions.\\nAll credit risk exposures are subject to regular monitoring. Performing wholesale accounts are reviewed on a regular basis, generally no less\\nfrequently than annually, with most subject to internal monitoring of triggers that, if breached, result in an interim review. The frequency of revie w\\nrises in accordance with the likelihood and size of potential credit losses, and deteriorating higher-risk situations are referred to specialized a ccount\\nmanagement groups for closer attention, as appropriate. In addition, regular portfolio and sector reviews are conducted, including stress testing and\\nscenario analysis based on current, emerging or prospective risks. Reporting is provided at least quarterly, and more frequently where appropriate ,t o\\nthe Board of Directors and senior management committees in order to keep them informed of credit risk developments in our portfolios, includingchanges in credit risk concentrations, watchlist accounts, impaired loans, provisions for credit losses, negative credit migration and significa nt\\nemerging credit risk issues. This supports the RRC and senior management committees in any related decisions they may make.\\nCounterparty credit risk (CCR) involves a bilateral risk of loss because the market value of a transaction can be positive or negative for either\\ncounterparty. CCR exposures are subject to the credit oversight, limits, risk management framework and approval process outlined above. However,given the nature of the risk, CCR exposures are also monitored under the market risk framework. In order to reduce our exposure to CCR, transactionsare often collateralized and trades may be cleared through a regulated central counterparty (CCP), which reduces overall systemic risk by standingbetween counterparties, maximizing netting across trades and insulating counterparties from each other’s defaults. CCPs mitigate the risk of defa ult\\nby any member through margin requirements (both initial and variation) and a default management process, including a default fund and otherprovisions. Our exposures to CCPs are subject to the same credit risk governance, monitoring and rating framework we apply to all other corporateaccounts.\\nCredit and Counterparty Risk Management\\nCollateral ManagementCollateral is used for credit risk mitigation purposes in order to minimize losses that would otherwise be incurred in the event of a default. Dependin g\\non the type of borrower or counterparty, the assets available and the structure and term of the credit obligations, collateral can take various forms.For wholesale borrowers, collateral can take the form of pledges of the assets of a business, such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or rea l\\nestate, or personal assets pledged in support of guarantees. For trading counterparties, BMO may enter into legally enforceable netting agreementsfor on-balance sheet credit exposures, when possible. In the securities financing business (including repurchase agreements and securities lendi ng\\nagreements), we obtain eligible financial collateral that we control and can readily liquidate.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 77\\n\\n\\n## Page 66\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nCollateral for BMO’s derivatives trading counterparty exposures primarily comprises cash and eligible liquid securities that are monitored and\\nrevalued on a daily basis. Collateral is obtained under the contractual terms of standardized industry documentation.\\nWith limited exceptions, we utilize the Master Agreement provided by International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc., frequently with a\\nCredit Support Annex, to document our collateralized trading relationships with counterparties for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that are n ot\\ncentrally cleared.\\nA Credit Support Annex entitles a party to demand a transfer of collateral (or other credit support) when its exposure to OTC derivatives of the\\nother party exceeds an agreed threshold. Collateral to be transferred can include variation margin or initial and variation margin. Credit SupportAnnexes contain, among other measures, certain thresholds and provisions setting out acceptable types of collateral, a method for their valuation(discounts are often applied to market values), the availability of the collateral for re-pledging by the recipient and the manner in which interest i st o\\nbe calculated.\\nTo document our contractual securities financing relationships with counterparties, we utilize master repurchase agreements for repurchase\\ntransactions, and master securities lending agreements for securities lending transactions.\\nOn a periodic basis, collateral is subject to revaluation based on the specific asset type. For loans, the value of collateral is initially establishe da t\\nthe time of origination, and the frequency of revaluation is dependent on the type of collateral. For certain types of collateral that change frequent ly\\n(e.g., accounts receivable and inventory), monitoring consists of borrower reporting, covenants and/or triggers, as appropriate, to provide earl y\\nwarning signs of collateral value deterioration. Periodic inspections of physical collateral may be performed, where appropriate, taking intoconsideration collateral type, borrower risk profile and the feasibility of conducting such inspections. For commercial real estate collateral, a full\\nexternal appraisal of the property is typically obtained at the time of loan origination, unless the exposure is below a specified threshold amount, i n\\nwhich case an internal evaluation and a site inspection are conducted. Internal evaluations may consider property tax assessments, purchase prices ,\\nreal estate listings or realtor opinions. The case for an updated appraisal is reviewed annually, with consideration given to the borrower risk ratin g,\\nexisting tenants and lease contracts, as well as current market conditions.\\nIn the event a loan is classified as impaired, and depending on its size, a current external appraisal, valuation or restricted use appraisal is\\nobtained and updated every 12 months, or more frequently as appropriate, as long as the loan remains classified as impaired. In Canada, forresidential real estate that has an original loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than 80%, an independent property valuation is routinely obtained at t he\\ntime of loan origination. For U.S. residential loans secured by real estate, an independent property valuation is obtained for loans that will be reta ined\\nin BMO’s loan portfolio. For certain real estate loans originated for sale to government-sponsored agencies, the requirement may be waived based onan existing valuation already on file with that agency.\\nWe may use an external service provided by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) or an automated valuation model from a third-\\nparty appraisal management provider to assist in determining either the current value of a property or the need for a full property appraisal.\\nFor insured residential mortgages in Canada with an original LTV ratio greater than 80%, the default insurer is responsible for confirming the\\ncurrent value of the property.\\nPortfolio Management and Concentrations of Credit and Counterparty Risk\\nOur credit risk governance policies require an acceptable level of diversification, intended to ensure we avoid undue concentrations of credit risk .\\nConcentrations of credit risk may exist when a relatively large number of clients are engaged in similar activities, are located in the same geographi c\\nregion or have similar economic characteristics such that their ability to meet contractual obligations could be similarly affected by changes ineconomic, political or other conditions. Limits may be specified for several portfolio dimensions, including industry, specialty segments, count ry,\\nproduct and single-name concentrations. We use a range of tools to reduce the credit risk exposures in our loan portfolio. These include asset sales,traditional securitizations, or the purchase of credit protection in the form of credit default swaps or credit insurance and risk transfer transact ions.\\nCredit risk is mitigated by obtaining protection from better-rated counterparties or high-quality collateral. Credit risk mitigation activities support our\\nmanagement of capital, and individual and portfolio credit concentration.\\nOur credit assets consist of a well-diversified portfolio representing millions of clients, the majority of them individual consumers and small to\\nmedium-sized businesses. On a drawn loans and commitments basis, our most significant credit exposure at default as at October 31, 2024 was toindividual consumers, comprising $353,309 million ($344,912 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nCredit valuation adjustments (CVA) are fair value adjustments to capture counterparty credit risk in our derivative valuations. CVA profit and loss\\n(P&L) is recognized daily and provides a mitigant to the loss from a counterparty default by recognizing the expected credit loss given thecounterparty’s probability of default, as well as our credit exposure. The risks that arise from CVA are subject to our risk governance framework andare actively monitored by a business unit reporting to trading management that has been designated to manage CVA P&L for the bank. Markethedging is performed to manage CVA risks. This activity is subject to the bank’s risk control framework in order to manage the effectiveness ofhedges, and to provide independent review and oversight. The bank calculates CVA capital using both the standardized and basic approachmethodologies for CVA.\\nWrong-Way Risk\\nWrong-way risk occurs when our exposure to a counterparty increases at the same time that the credit quality of that counterparty deteriorates.Specific wrong-way risk arises when the credit quality of the counterparty and the market risk factors affecting collateral or other risk mitigantsdisplay a high correlation, and general wrong-way risk arises when the credit quality of the counterparty, for non-specific reasons, is highly corre lated\\nwith macroeconomic or other factors that affect the value of the risk mitigant. Our procedures require that specific wrong-way risk be identified intransactions and accounted for in the assessment of risk, including any heightened level of exposure.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\n78BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 67\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Credit and Counterparty Risk Measurement\\nBMO quantifies credit risk at both the individual borrower or counterparty level and the portfolio level. In order to limit earnings volatility, mana ge\\nexpected credit losses and minimize unexpected losses, credit risk is assessed and measured using the following risk-based parameters:\\n‰Exposure at Default (EAD) represents an estimate of the outstanding amount of a credit exposure at the time a default may occur.\\n‰Loss Given Default (LGD) is a measure of BMO’s economic loss, such as the amount that may not be recovered in the event of a default, presented\\nas a proportion of the exposure at default.\\n‰Probability of Default (PD) represents the likelihood that a borrower or counterparty will go into default over a one-year time horizon.\\n‰Expected Loss (EL) is a measure of the loss that BMO is expected to incur in the normal course of business in a given period of time. EL is\\ncalculated as a function of EAD, LGD and PD.\\nUnder Basel III, OSFI permits three approaches to the measurement of credit risk: Standardized, Foundation Internal Ratings Based (FIRB) and\\nAdvanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB). BMO primarily uses the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach, which includes both FIRB and AIRB, todetermine credit risk-weighted assets (RWA) in its portfolios, including portfolios of the bank’s subsidiary BMO Financial Corp. Under the Basel II I\\nReform requirement, it is mandatory to apply FIRB to a subset of IRB exposures where LGD and EAD are based on regulatory prescribed values. Referto the Supplementary Regulatory Capital Information disclosure for details regarding the total exposure (measured as EAD) of Retail and Wholesaleportfolios under the IRB Approach to determining regulatory capital. The remaining exposures reflect waivers and exemptions to the IRB Approachand are measured under the Standardized Approach, subject to OSFI’s approval. We continue to transition all material exposures in this category tothe IRB Approach. For securitization exposures, we apply the Basel hierarchy of approaches, including the Securitization Internal Ratings BasedApproach and the External Ratings Based Approach, as well as the Standardized Approach.\\nBMO’s regulatory capital and economic capital frameworks both use EAD to assess credit and counterparty risk. Capital is calculated based on\\nexposures that, where applicable, have been redistributed to a more favourable PD band or LGD measure, or a different Basel asset class, as a resultof the application of credit risk mitigation and a consideration of credit risk mitigants, including collateral and netting.\\nTotal credit exposures at default by type and industry sector, as at October 31, 2024 and 2023, based on the Basel III classifications, are disclosed in\\nthe table below.\\nTABLE 34\\n(Canadian $ in millions) Drawn (3) (7)Commitments\\n(undrawn) (3) (8)Other off-balance\\nsheet items (3) (9) OTC derivatives (4) (10)Repo-style\\ntransactions (4) (5) (11) Total (1)\\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\\nIndividual 287,741 281,087 65,568 63,812 – 13 – – – – 353,309 344,912\\nFinancial institutions 105,378 95,366 20,484 18,690 7,447 7,201 27,393 19,307 17,712 16,177 178,414 156,741\\nGovernments 230,353 219,795 3,024 2,551 1,760 1,575 4,481 8,193 1,070 5,870 240,688 237,984\\nManufacturing 33,561 33,046 15,555 16,059 1,696 1,915 1,049 807 – – 51,861 51,827\\nReal estate 66,650 61,734 8,632 11,843 1,234 971 412 224 – – 76,928 74,772\\nRetail trade 30,595 27,825 4,262 4,621 645 441 152 129 – – 35,654 33,016\\nService industries 54,433 56,588 13,830 13,552 3,192 3,172 990 696 – – 72,445 74,008\\nWholesale trade 21,868 19,997 7,212 7,618 670 611 268 167 – – 30,018 28,393\\nOil and gas 3,180 3,335 3,010 2,889 623 788 610 1,444 – – 7,423 8,456\\nUtilities 10,068 11,101 9,304 8,767 3,799 4,547 2,444 1,850 – – 25,615 26,265\\nOthers (2) 54,173 63,210 19,247 18,132 4,343 4,009 2,306 1,634 – – 80,069 86,985\\nTotal exposure at\\ndefault (6) 898,000 873,084 170,128 168,534 25,409 25,243 40,105 34,451 18,782 22,047 1,152,424 1,123,359\\n(1) Credit exposure excluding equity, securitization and other assets, such as non-significant investments, goodwill, deferred tax assets and int angibles.\\n(2) Includes remaining industries that individually comprise less than 2% of total exposures.(3) Represents gross credit exposures without accounting for collateral.(4) Credit exposure at default is inclusive of collateral.(5) Repo-style transactions include repos, reverse repos and securities lending transactions, which represent both asset and liability exposures .

Adjudication models, behavioural scorecards, decision tree s and expert knowledge are combined to generate optimal credit decisions in a\\ncentralized and automated environment.\\nThe retail risk rating system assesses risk based on individual loan characteristics. We have a range of internally developed PD, LGD and EAD\\nmodels for each of the major retail portfolios. The principle product lines within each of the retail portfolios are modelled separately, so that the r isk-\\nbased parameters capture the distinct nature of each product. The models, in general, are based on internal historical data recorded over a multi-yea r\\nperiod that includes at least one full economic cycle, in compliance with regulatory requirements. Adjustments are incorporated into the parameter s,\\nas appropriate, to account for uncertainties. The retail parameters are tested and calibrated on an annual basis, if required, to incorporate additi onal\\ndata points and recent experience in the parameter estimation process. Risk drivers used in the retail credit models may include customer attributes\\nsuch as delinquency status and credit scores, and account attributes such as loan amounts and utilization.\\n‰APD estimate is assigned to each homogeneous pool to reflect the long-run average of one-year default rates over the economic cycle.\\n‰AnLGD estimate is calculated by discounting future recovery payments to the time of default, including collection costs.\\n‰AnEAD estimate is calculated as the balance at default divided by the credit limit at the beginning of the year. For non-revolving products, such as\\nmortgages, EAD is equal to 100% of the current outstanding balance and has no undrawn component.\\nFor capital purposes, the LGD and EAD estimates are calibrated to reflect downturn conditions. The PD, LGD and EAD estimates are updated annuallyand recalibrated as required by comparing the estimates to observed historical experience.\\nRetail Credit Probability of Default Bands by Risk RatingTABLE 35\\nRisk profile Probability of default band\\nExceptionally low ≤0.05%\\nVery low > 0.05% to 0.20%Low > 0.20% to 0.75%Medium > 0.75% to 7.00%High > 7.00% to 99.99%Default 100%\\nWholesale (Sovereign, Bank, Corporate and Commercial)\\nWithin our wholesale portfolios, an enterprise-wide risk rating framework is applied to all sovereign, bank, corporate and commercial counterpart ies.\\nOne key element of this framework is the assignment of appropriate borrower or counterparty risk ratings (BRRs). We have a range of internallydeveloped general and sector-specific BRR models, as well as portfolio-level LGD and EAD models.\\nThe BRR models capture the key financial and non-financial characteristics of the borrowers and generate a borrower-level rating that reflects the\\nrelative ranking of the default risk. The models are primarily based on internal data, supplemented by judgment as necessary, for low-defaultportfolios.\\nBRRs are assessed and assigned at the time of loan origination, and reassessed when borrowers request changes to credit facilities or when\\nevents trigger a review, such as an external rating change or a covenant breach. BRRs are typically reviewed no less frequently than annually, andmore frequent reviews are conducted for borrowers with less acceptable risk ratings. The assigned ratings are mapped to a PD reflecting the\\nlikelihood of default over a one-year time horizon. As a borrower migrates between risk ratings, the PD associated with the borrower also changes.\\nWe employ a master scale with 14 BRRs above default, and PDs are assigned to each rating within an asset class to reflect the long-run average\\nof one-year default rates over an economic cycle, supplemented by external benchmarking, as necessary.\\nAn LGD estimate captures the priority of claim, collateral, product and sector characteristics of the credit facility extended to a borrower. LGD\\nestimates are at the facility level.\\nAn EAD estimate captures the facility type, sector and utilization rate characteristics of the credit facility extended to a borrower. EAD estimates\\nare at the facility level. An EAD credit conversion factor is calculated for eligible facilities by comparing amounts drawn at the time of default and o ne\\nyear prior to default.\\nLGD and EAD models have been developed using internal data recorded over a multi-year period that includes at least one full economic cycle, in\\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. Results are benchmarked using external data when necessary and adjustments are incorporated into theparameters, as appropriate, to account for uncertainties. For capital purposes, the LGD and EAD parameters are calibrated to reflect downturnconditions.

CRE primarily refers to two distinct types of real estate businesses: income-producing real estate(office, industrial and retail space, and multi-family residential buildings with more than four dwelling units), including the construction of th ese\\nassets; and development of land and construction of properties for sale (subdivisions, condominiums and other types of property). Our primary focusis income-producing commercial real estate portfolios with stable operating performance, diversified portfolios, modest leverage and continuedaccess to capital, including those legally structured as real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate investment funds and real estate operat ing\\ncompanies (REOCs), as well as pension funds and other established owners of income-producing commercial real estate.\\nOur CRE portfolio was $75.4 billion as at October 31, 2024 ($69.7 billion as at October 31, 2023) and accounted for 11% of total gross loans and\\nacceptances (10% as at October 31, 2023). The portfolio is well-managed, with consistent and conservative underwriting standards, strict lendingcriteria and structural resilience. As at October 31, 2024, impaired loans represented 1% of the portfolio (1% as at October 31, 2023).\\nOur CRE portfolio is well-diversified across businesses, property types and geographic regions. Given the widespread adoption of remote and\\nhybrid work arrangements, office space is one of the higher-risk portfolio segments within commercial real estate. Office CRE was $7.7 billion as atOctober 31, 2024, including $5.5 billion in the United States ($8.3 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, as at October 31, 2023). In addition tomonitoring the limits we set for the CRE portfolio, we apply lower limits on each segment, including office space, which helps us mitigate exposure torelated risks.\\nReal Estate Secured Lending\\nReal estate secured lending comprises residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) we extend to individuals, secured byresidential real estate, which is defined as residential structures with one to four dwelling units. The increases in prime interest rates duringfiscal 2022 and 2023 impacted variable-rate mortgages, resulting in extended and negative amortization. Customer actions and decreases in interes t\\nrates in fiscal 2024 have reduced extended and negative amortization compared with the prior year.

We manage loans through a credit risk framework, which includes structural elements, limits and risk mitigation. As atOctober 31, 2024, total leveraged loans outstanding, gross of risk mitigation, were $31.9 billion and represented 2% of total assets ($29.5 billionand 2%, respectively, as at October 31, 2023), of which $10.0 billion or 31% outstanding ($9.4 billion or 32% as at October 31, 2023) represented alower level of credit risk due to high-quality collateral assets, including asset-based lending and real estate. The remainder of the portfolio is we ll-\\ndiversified across sectors and includes loans to borrowers where we have relatively small hold sizes. As at October 31, 2024, $1.3 billion or 4% of allleveraged finance loans were classified as impaired ($589 million or 2% as at October 31, 2023). This portfolio is closely managed by specializedteams and within a limit structure. In addition to originating leveraged finance loans, we also underwrite leveraged finance loans, which is managedthrough the market risk framework.\\n(1) Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the current year’s presentation.\\n82BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 71\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Gross Impaired Loans\\nTotal gross impaired loans and acceptances (GIL) were $5,843 million, an increase from $3,960 million in the prior year. The increase in impairedloans was predominantly in business and government lending, with increases in several sectors.

We maintain both an allowance for credit losses on impaired loans and an allowance for credit losses onperforming loans, in accordance with IFRS. An allowance on performing loans is maintained to cover impairment in the existing portfolio for loansthat have not yet been individually identified as impaired. Our approach to establishing and maintaining the allowance on performing loans is basedon the requirements of IFRS, considering the guideline issued by our regulator, OSFI. Under the IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) expected credit\\nloss (ECL) methodology, an allowance is recorded for ECL on financial assets regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. We recognizean allowance for loss at an amount generally based on 12 months of ECL, if the credit risk at the reporting date has not increased significantly sinceinitial recognition (Stage 1). We record ECL over the remaining life of performing financial assets that are considered to have experienced a signifi cant\\nincrease in credit risk (Stage 2).\\nAn allowance on impaired loans is maintained to reduce the carrying value of individually identified impaired loans (Stage 3) to the expected\\nrecoverable amount.\\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) at a level that we consider appropriate to absorb credit-related losses. As at October 31, 2024,\\nthe total ACL was $4,936 million, an increase of $669 million from the prior year, reflecting higher allowances on both performing and impaired loans.The allowance on impaired loans was $731 million as at October 31, 2024, and the allowance on performing loans was $4,205 million. Theseamounts included an allowance on impaired loans of $78 million and an allowance on performing loans of $502 million, related to undrawncommitments and letters of credit that are considered other credit instruments and recorded in other liabilities. The allowance on impaired loansincreased $36 million from $695 million in the prior year. The allowance on performing loans increased $633 million from $3,572 million in the prioryear, primarily driven by portfolio credit migration, uncertainty in credit conditions and model updates, partially offset by improvement in themacroeconomic outlook, including the adoption of a fourth economic scenario, and the impact of the sale of a portfolio of recreational vehicle loans.\\nFurther details on the key assumptions used in the measurement of ACL can be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section;\\ncontinuity in ACL by each product type can be found in Tables 71 and 72 in the Supplemental Information and in Note 4 of the audited annualconsolidated financial statements.\\nInternational Exposures\\nBMO’s geographic exposures to regions outside of Canada and the United States are subject to a risk management framework that incorporatesassessments of economic and political risks in each region or country. These exposures are also managed within limits based on product, entity andcountry of ultimate risk. Our total net exposure to these regions is set out in the table below.\\nThe table outlines total net exposure for funded lending and undrawn commitments, securities (including cash products, traded credit and credit\\ndefault swap activity), repo-style transactions and derivatives.

The magnitude and importance of these\\nactivities to the enterprise, along with the potential volatility of market variables, call for diligent governance and a robust market risk managem ent\\nframework that can provide effective identification, measurement, reporting and control of market risk exposures.\\nTrading and Underwriting Market Risk Governance\\nOur market risk-taking activities are subject to an extensive governance framework. The Risk Review Committee (RRC) oversees the managementof market risk on behalf of the Board of Directors and approves limits governing market risk exposures that are consistent with our risk appetite.The Risk Management Committee (RMC) regularly reviews and assesses significant market risk exposures and positions, and exercises ongoingsenior management oversight of our risk-taking activities. Both of these committees are kept apprised of specific market risk exposures and anydevelopments that could expose BMO to unusual, unexpected or unquantified risks associated with those market risk exposures, as well as othercurrent and emerging market risks. In addition, all businesses and individuals authorized to conduct trading and underwriting activities on behalf of\\nBMO are required to work within our governance framework and, as part of their first-line-of-defence responsibilities, they must adhere to allrelevant corporate policies, standards and procedures, and maintain and manage market risk exposures within specified limits and risk tolerances.In support of our risk governance framework, our market risk management framework comprises processes, infrastructure and supportingdocumentation which together support the identification, assessment, independent monitoring and control of our market risk exposures.\\nTrading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nOur trading and underwriting businesses give rise to market risk associated with buying and selling financial products in the course of meeting ourcustomers’ needs, such as market-making and related financing activities, and assisting clients to raise funds by way of securities issuance.\\nIdentification and Assessment of Trading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nAs the first step in the management of market risk, rigorous assessment processes are in place to identify market risk exposures associated with bothnew products and the evolving risk profile of existing products, including on- and off-balance sheet positions, trading and non-trading positions,leveraged loan, bond and equity underwriting, and market risk exposures arising from the domestic and foreign operations of our operating groups.\\nVarious metrics and techniques are then employed to measure identified market risk exposures. These include Value-at-Risk and stress tests, as\\nwell as sensitivity to market risk factors and position concentrations. Results are reported to the appropriate line of business, the RMC and RRC on aregular basis.\\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) measures the maximum loss likely to be experienced in the trading and underwriting portfolios, measured at a 99%\\nconfidence level over a one-day holding period. It incorporates the risk to the value of the bank’s trading and underwriting portfolios fromchanges in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices and their implied volatilities and correlations.\\nAlthough it is a useful indicator of risk, VaR has limitations, as with any model-driven metric. It assumes that all portfolio positions can be\\nliquidated within one day and that historical data can be used as a proxy to forecast future market events. In addition, VaR calculations are basedon portfolio positions at the close of business and do not reflect the impact of intra-day activity.\\nStress Tests are used to determine the potential impact of low-frequency, high-severity events on the trading and underwriting portfolios.\\nThe portfolios are measured daily against a variety of hypothetical and historical event scenarios, including the 2008 global financial crisis and t he\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, along with portfolio-specific impacts and asset class scenarios. Scenarios are continuously refined to reflect the latest mark et\\nconditions and portfolio risk exposures. Market liquidity horizons are reviewed for suitability and scenarios updated where appropriate. In addit ion,\\na range of assumptions, including the duration of the scenario and management actions, are incorporated in the stress tests to better reflect theanticipated impact on the trading and underwriting business.\\nVaR and stress testing metrics should not be viewed as definitive predictors of the maximum amount of losses that could be experienced in the\\ntrading and underwriting portfolios in any one day, as their results are based on models and estimates and are subject to confidence levels, and theestimates could be exceeded under unforeseen market conditions.\\nOur VaR model is back-tested on a daily basis, assuming there are no changes to the previous day’s closing position, and isolates the effects of\\neach day’s price movements against those closing positions. The one-day 99% confidence level VaR at the local and consolidated BMO levels iscompared with the estimated daily profit and loss (P&L) that would be recorded if the portfolio composition remained unchanged. If this P&L result isnegative and its absolute value is greater than the previous day’s VaR, a back-testing exception occurs. Each exception is investigated, explained a nd\\ndocumented.\\nModels support the measurement of our exposure to the risk of adverse outcomes for income, retained earnings and capital. We use a variety of\\nmethods to verify the integrity of our risk models, including the application of back-testing against hypothetical losses and approval by anindependent model validation team. The data and correlations that underpin our models are updated frequently, so that risk metrics reflect currentmarket conditions.\\nMarket Risk RWA is calculated using a standardized approach under Basel III for trading book activities along with foreign exchange risk in the\\nbanking book. Policies defining the activities eligible for trading book capital treatment and banking book capital treatment are used to delineatein-scope activity. Exceptions to general assumptions about trading and banking book categories are reported to OSFI. Such exceptions principally a rise\\nfrom instruments that are designated as trading under IFRS but used to hedge banking book market risks, along with deferred compensation planhedging. The fair value of instruments under exception is $1,459 million net liability and $11,571 million gross.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 85\\n\\n\\n## Page 74\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nMonitoring and Control of Trading and Underwriting Market Risk\\nLimits are set for our trading and underwriting activities, and are subject to regular monitoring and reporting.

The RMC and Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) provide ongoing senior management oversight of risk positionsand related activities.\\nStructural Market Risk Measurement\\nInterest Rate RiskStructural interest rate risk arises when changes in interest rates affect the market value, cash flows and earnings of assets and liabilities relate d\\nto our banking activities. The objective of structural interest rate risk management is to maintain high-quality earnings and maximize sustainableproduct spreads, while managing risk to the economic value of our net assets arising from changes in interest rates.\\nStructural interest rate risk primarily comprises interest rate mismatch risk and product-embedded option risk.Interest rate mismatch risk arises when there are differences in the scheduled maturities, repricing dates or reference rates of assets, liabilitie s\\nand derivatives. The net interest rate mismatch, representing residual assets funded by common shareholders’ equity, is managed to align with atarget maturity profile through interest rate swaps and securities.\\nProduct-embedded option risk arises when product features allow customers to alter the timing of cash flows, such as scheduled maturity or\\nrepricing dates, usually in response to changes in market conditions. Product-embedded options include loan prepayments, deposit redemptionprivileges and committed rates on unadvanced mortgages. Product-embedded options and associated customer behaviour are captured in riskmodelling, and hedging programs may be used to limit the level of exposure to this risk.\\nStructural interest rate risk is measured using simulations, analyses of the sensitivity of earnings and economic value, stress testing and gap\\nanalysis, in addition to other risk metrics.\\nEarnings Sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the projected 12-month pre-tax net income from a portfolio\\nof assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions in response to presc ribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at z ero.\\nEconomic Value Sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the market value of a portfolio of assets, liabilities\\nand off-balance sheet positions in response to prescribed parallel interest rate movements, with interest rates floored at zero.\\nThe models that measure structural interest rate risk incorporate project ed changes in interest rates and predi ct the likely reaction of our custome rs to\\nthese changes. For customer loans and deposits with scheduled maturit y and repricing dates (such as mortgages and term deposits), the models\\nmeasure the extent to which customers are likely to use embedded options to alter those scheduled dates and timing. For customer loans and deposits\\nwithout scheduled maturity and repricing dates (such as credit card loans a nd chequing accounts), exposure is measured using models that adjust for\\nelasticity in product pricing and reflect historical and forecasted trend s in balances. The results generated by these structural market risk model sa r e\\ninherently uncertain, as they reflect potential future pricing and custom er behaviour, which may differ from actual experience. These models have b een\\ndeveloped using statistical analysis and are independently validated an d periodically updated through regula r model performance assessment, bac k-\\ntesting and ongoing dialogue with the lines of busi ness. Models developed to predict customer beha viour are also used to support product pricing.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 87\\n\\n\\n## Page 76\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAll models are subject to BMO’s Model Risk Management Framework, which is described in more detail in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management\\nFramework section.\\nThe sensitivity of structural interest rate earnings and economic value to an immediate parallel increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the\\nyield curve is disclosed in the table below.\\nThe sensitivity of structural economic value to rising interest rates primarily reflects a lower market value for fixed-rate loans. The sensitivity of\\nstructural economic value to falling interest rates primarily reflects the impact of a higher market value for fixed-rate loans and minimum modelledclient deposit rates. The exposure of structural economic value to rising interest rates and the benefits of falling interest rates decreased relati ve to\\nOctober 31, 2023, primarily due to modelled deposit pricing being less rate sensitive at lower projected interest rate levels following the decrease in\\nterm market rates during the year. Structural earnings sensitivity quantifies the potential impact of interest rate changes on structural balance s heet\\npre-tax net income over the next 12 months. The sensitivity of structural earnings to falling interest rates primarily reflects the risk of fixed-rat e and\\nfloating-rate loans repricing at lower rates and the more limited ability to reduce deposit pricing as rates fall. The benefits of rising interest rat es to\\nstructural earnings primarily reflect the positive impact of reinvesting our net equity and non-rate sensitive deposits into assets with higher-te rm\\nrates. The benefits of rising interest rates to structural earnings increased modestly relative to October 31, 2023. The exposure of falling interes t rates\\nto structural earnings decreased relative to October 31, 2023, primarily due to the impact of modelled prepayment penalty fee collection on certainprepayable instruments.\\nDuring 2024, both economic value sensitivity and earnings sensitivity remained within the limits established by the Board of Directors.\\nStructural Interest Rate Sensitivity(1) (2)\\nTABLE 45\\nEconomic value sensitivity Earnings sensitivity\\n(Pre-tax Canadian $ equivalent in millions)October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023 October 31, 2024 October 31, 2023\\nCanada (3) United States Total Total Canada (3) United States Total Total\\n100 basis point increase (693) (790) (1,483) (1,849) 139 228 367 304\\n100 basis point decrease 597 63 660 1,492 (101) (109) (210) (325)\\n(1) Losses are presented in brackets and gains are presented as positive numbers.\\n(2) Interest rate sensitivities assume an immediate and sustained parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at the end of the period, using a constant balance sheet.\\n(3) Includes Canadian dollar and other currencies.\\nThe table below presents net loans and acceptances by interest rate sensitivity.\\nTABLE 46\\n(Canadian $ in millions) 2024 2023\\nFixed rate (1)\\nContractual amounts that will reprice/repay within 3 months 213,314 213,854\\nContractual amounts that will reprice/repay after 3 months 254,872 248,688\\nFloating rate (2) 202,031 186,327\\nNon-rate sensitive (3) 8,158 15,907\\nTotal 678,375 664,776\\n(1) Includes index-based loans.\\n(2) Floating rate only includes loans that reprice immediately upon a change in interest rates.(3) Includes credit card balances that are paid when due, customers’ liability under acceptances, impaired loans and allowance for credit losses.\\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified for changes in accounting policy.\\nInsurance Market Risk\\nInsurance market risk includes interest rate and equity market risk arising from the activities of our BMO Insurance business. During the 2024 fiscal\\nyear, we entered into hedging arrangements to offset the impact of changes in interest rates and equity market values on our earnings. Thesensitivity includes the impact of these hedging relationships. The impact of insurance market risk on earnings is reflected in insurance investmen t\\nresults on our Consolidated Statement of Income, and the corresponding change in insurance contract liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.The impact of insurance market risk is not reflected in the Structural Interest Rate Sensitivity table above.\\nThe bank adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) effective November 1, 2023. IFRS 17 changes the fundamental principles used to\\nrecognize and measure insurance contracts, including life insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts held and investment contracts with discret ionary\\nparticipation features. This change impacts the timing of when investment-related income emerges and the associated market risk sensitivities, asthe discount rates used to calculate the present value of insurance liabilities are no longer based on the assets supporting those liabilities, but ra ther\\non the features of the insurance liabilities themselves. As such, insurance market risk largely reflects the interest rate risk arising from a mismat ch in\\nliability and asset cash flows.\\nOn transition, we applied the full retrospective approach to our creditor business and the fair value approach to all other products written prior to\\nNovember 1, 2022.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\n88BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 77\\n\\n                          MD&A                          The table below reflects the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, our net income to certain changes in interest rates, and includes the\\nestimated impact of hedging arrangements.\\nTABLE 47\\n(Pre-tax Canadian $ in millions) 2024 (1) 2023\\n50 basis point increase 6 23\\n50 basis point decrease (9) (30)\\n(1) Interest rate sensitivities assume a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve as at the end of the period, with no chan ge in the ultimate risk-free rate.\\nFor further information, refer to the Changes in Accounting Policies in 2024 section and Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial\\nstatements. In addition, information on insurance risk governance can be found in the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management section.\\nNon-Trading Foreign Exchange Risk\\nStructural foreign exchange risk arises primarily from translation risk related to our net investment in U.S. operations and from transaction riskassociated with U.S.-dollar-denominated net income.\\nTranslation risk arises from the potential impact that changes in foreign exchange rates could have on our reported shareholders’ equity and\\ncapital ratios. We economically manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our capital ratios. Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital\\nManagement section for further discussion.\\nTransaction risk arises from the potential impact that fluctuations in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate could have on the Canadian\\ndollar equivalent of BMO’s U.S.-dollar-denominated financial results. Exchange rate fluctuations will affect future results measured in Canadia n dollars,\\nand the impact on those results is a function of the periods during which revenues, expenses and provisions for credit losses arise. Hedging positionsmay be taken to partially offset the pre-tax effects of Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations on financial results, although we did not\\nenter into any hedging arrangements in the current or prior year. If future results are consistent with results in fiscal 2024, each one cent increase(decrease) in the Canadian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate would be expected to increase (decrease) the Canadian dollar equivalent of U.S. segmentnet income before income taxes for the year by $26 million, in the absence of hedging arrangements.

Insurance provides protection against the financial consequences of insured risks by transferring those risks to the insurer (underspecific terms and conditions) in exchange for premiums. Insurance risk is inherent in all of our insurance products: life insurance, annuities (whi ch\\ninclude the pension risk transfer business), accident and sickness insurance, and creditor insurance, as well as the reinsurance business. Insuran ce risk\\nconsists of:\\n‰Claims risk – the risk that the actual magnitude or frequency of claims will differ from those assumed in the pricing or underwriting process,including mortality risk, morbidity risk, longevity risk and catastrophic risk.\\n‰Policyholder behaviour risk – the risk that the behaviour of policyholders in regard to premium payments, withdrawals or loans, as well as policylapses and surrenders and other voluntary terminations, will differ from the behaviour assumed in the pricing process.\\n‰Expense risk – the risk that actual expenses arising from acquiring and administering policies and processing claims will exceed the expensesassumed in the pricing process.\\nOur risk governance practices provide effective independent oversight and control of risk within BMO Insurance. BMO Insurance’s risk management\\nframework addresses the identification, assessment, management, monitoring and reporting of risks. The framework includes: the Risk AppetiteStatement and key risk metrics; insurance risk policies and processes, including limits; capital requirements; stress testing; risk reports; the O wn Risk\\nand Solvency Assessment; and ongoing monitoring of experience. Senior management within the various lines of business uses this framework,serving as the first line of defence and assuming the primary responsibility for managing insurance risk. Second-line-of-defence oversight is prov ided\\nby the CRO, BMO Insurance, who reports to the CRO, BMO Wealth Management. Internal risk committees, the boards of directors of the BMO Insurancesubsidiaries and senior management provide senior governance and review. In particular, the Risk Committee of BMO Insurance oversees and reportson risk management activities to the insurance companies’ boards of directors on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Audit and Conduct ReviewCommittee of the Board of Directors acts as the Audit and Conduct Review Committee for BMO Life Insurance Company.\\nA robust product approval process is a cornerstone of the BMO Insurance risk management framework, as it identifies, assesses and manages\\nrisks associated with new insurance products or changes to existing products. This process, along with guidelines and practices for underwriting an d\\nclaims management, promotes the effective identification, assessment and management of insurance risk. Reinsurance transactions that transfer o r\\ncede insurance risk from BMO Insurance to independent reinsurance companies also mitigate our exposure to insurance risk by diversifying risk andlimiting claims. BMO Insurance has exited the Property and Casualty Reinsurance market, with the last remaining treaty terminated in January 2021,significantly reducing our exposure to catastrophic claims and, in turn, the risks arising from climate change. However, a certain portion of ourexposure to catastrophic claims remains as the portfolio runs off and until all outstanding claims that were made prior to the treaty termination date s\\nare settled and paid.\\nThe table below presents the sensitivities before and after risk mitigation by reinsurance and assumes that all other variables remain constant.\\nTABLE 49\\n2024 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions)Contractual service margin Profit or loss Contractual service margin Profit or loss\\nGross Net Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net\\nPolicy-related assumptions\\nMortality rates (1% increase) (1) (17) 10 1 1 (14) 9 – –\\nLapse rates (10% increase) (2) (151) (52) (10) (4) (161) (63) (4) (2)\\nExpenses (5% increase) (3) (15) (15) – – (9) (9) – –\\n(1) Mortality relates to the occurrence of death and is a key assumption for our life insurance business.\\n(2) Policies are terminated through lapses and surrenders, where lapses represent the termination of policies due to non-payment of premiums and sur renders represent the voluntary termination of\\npolicies by policyholders.\\n(3) Directly attributable operating expense assumptions reflect the projected costs of maintaining and servicing in-force policies, including as sociated directly attributable overhead expenses.\\nCaution\\nThis Insurance Risk section contains forward-looking statements.

Financial commitments include liabilities to depositors and suppliers, as well as lending, investment and pledging commitments.\\nManaging liquidity and funding risk is integral to maintaining enterprise soundness and safety, depositor confidence and earnings stability. It is BMO’s\\npolicy to maintain a level of liquid assets and funding capacity sufficient to meet our financial commitments, even in times of stress.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Governance\\nThe Corporate Treasury group and the operating groups, as the first line of defence, are responsible for the ongoing identification, assessment andmanagement of liquidity and funding risk. The Corporate Treasury group is responsible for monitoring and reporting on exposures to liquidity andfunding risk across the enterprise; develops and recommends for approval the Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework and the relatedrisk appetite statement and limits; monitors compliance with relevant corporate policies; and assesses the impact of market events on liquidity andfunding requirements on an ongoing basis.\\nEnterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM), as the second line of defence, exercises oversight, conducts independent risk assessment and\\nprovides effective challenge of liquidity and funding management frameworks, policies, limits, monitoring and reporting across the enterprise.\\nThe Risk Management Committee (RMC) and Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) provide senior management oversight, and review and discuss\\nsignificant liquidity and funding policies, issues and developments that arise in the pursuit of BMO’s strategic priorities. The Risk Review Commit tee\\n(RRC) provides oversight of the management of liquidity and funding risk, annually approves the applicable policies, limits and contingency plan, a nd\\nregularly reviews liquidity and funding positions.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Management\\nBMO’s Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework is defined and authorized in alignment with corporate policies approved by our Board ofDirectors and standards approved by management. These policies and standards set out key management principles, liquidity and funding metricsand related limits, as well as roles and responsibilities in the management of liquidity and funding risk across the enterprise.\\nWe have a robust limit structure in place in order to manage liquidity and funding risk. These limits define BMO’s risk appetite for the key Stress\\nNet Liquidity Position (Stress NLP) measure, regulatory liquidity ratios, secured and unsecured funding appetite (for both trading and structuralactivities), as well as enterprise collateral pledging. Limits also establish the tolerance for concentrations of maturities, as well as requireme nts for\\ncounterparty liability diversification, business pledging activity, and the size and type of committed and uncommitted credit and liquidity facil ities that\\nmay be outstanding.\\nOperating within these limits helps to confirm that liquidity and funding risk is appropriately managed. An enterprise-wide contingency plan\\nintended to facilitate effective risk management in the event of a disruption is also in place. Early warning indicators identified in the contingenc y\\nplan are regularly monitored in order to detect any signs of rising levels of liquidity or funding risk in the market, or any exposure to other risksspecific to BMO.\\nBMO legal entities include regulated and foreign subsidiaries and branches, and as a result, movements of funds between entities in the\\ncorporate group are subject to, among other things, the liquidity, funding and capital adequacy requirements of these entities. As such, liquidity a nd\\nfunding positions are managed on both a consolidated and key legal entity basis. Liquidity and funding risk management policies and limits, informedby the laws and regulations that apply to each entity, are in place for key legal entities, and positions are regularly reviewed at the key legal entitylevel to confirm compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\\nBMO continued to maintain a strong liquidity position during fiscal 2024. Customer loans and deposits continued to grow, while wholesale\\nfunding decreased, reflecting net maturities. Our liquidity metrics, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NS FR),\\nexceeded internal targets and regulatory requirements throughout fiscal 2024.\\nLiquidity and Funding Risk Measurement\\nA key component of liquidity risk management is the measurement of liquidity risk under stress. We use Stress NLP as a key measure of liquidity risk.Stress NLP represents the amount by which liquid assets exceed potential funding needs under severe systemic and enterprise-specific stressscenarios, and a combination thereof. Potential funding needs may arise from obligations to repay retail, commercial and wholesale deposits that ar e\\nwithdrawn or not renewed, or to fund drawdowns on available credit and liquidity lines, as well as from obligations to pledge collateral due to ratingsdowngrades or market volatility, along with the continuing need to fund new assets and strategic investments. Potential funding needs are quantifie d\\nby applying factors to various business activities based on management’s view of the relative level of liquidity risk related to each activity. Thesefactors vary by deposit classification (e.g., retail, small business, non-financial corporate or wholesale counterparties) and deposit type (e.g ., insured,\\nuninsured, operational or non-operational deposits), as well as by commitment type (e.g., committed or uncommitted credit or liquidity facilities by\\ncounterparty type). Stress scenarios also consider the time horizon over which liquid assets can be monetized and management’s assessment of theliquidity value of those assets under conditions of market stress. These potential funding needs are assessed under severe systemic and enterprise-specific stress scenarios, and a combination thereof.\\nStress testing results are evaluated against our stated risk appetite and are considered in management’s decisions on limit-setting and internal\\nliquidity transfer pricing, and they also help to inform and shape the design of business plans and contingency plans. The Liquidity and Funding RiskManagement Framework is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing.\\nIn addition to Stress NLP, we regularly monitor positions in relation to the limits and liquidity ratios noted in the Liquidity and Funding Risk\\nManagement section above. These include regulatory metrics such as LCR, Net Cumulative Cash Flow and NSFR.\\nMaterial presented in a blue-tinted font above is an integral part of Note 5 of the 2024 audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 91\\n\\n\\n## Page 80\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nUnencumbered Liquid Assets\\nUnencumbered liquid assets include high-quality assets that are marketable, can be pledged as security for borrowings, and can be converted to cash\\nin a time frame that meets liquidity and funding requirements. Liquid assets are primarily held in our trading businesses, as well as in supplementalliquidity pools that are maintained for contingent liquidity risk management purposes. The liquidity values recognized for different asset classes under\\nBMO’s risk management framework reflect management’s assessment of the liquidity values of those assets under a severe stress scenario. Liquidassets held in our trading businesses comprise cash on deposit with central banks, short-term deposits with other financial institutions, highly-r ated\\ndebt securities, equity securities and short-term reverse repurchase agreements. Supplemental liquidity pool assets primarily comprise cash ondeposit with central banks, securities, and short-term reverse repurchase agreements for highly-rated Canadian federal and provincial governmen t\\ndebt and U.S. federal government and agency debt. Substantially all supplemental liquidity pool assets meet the definition of high-quality liquidassets under Basel III. The size of the supplemental liquidity pool is integrated with our assessment of liquidity risk. In order to comply with localregulatory requirements, certain legal entities maintain their own minimum liquidity positions. There may be legal and regulatory restrictions onBMO’s ability to use liquid assets held at one legal entity to support the liquidity requirements of another legal entity.\\nIn the normal course of business, we may encumber a portion of cash and securities holdings as collateral in support of trading activities and\\nparticipation in clearing and payment systems in Canada and abroad. In addition, we may receive liquid assets as collateral and may re-pledge theseassets in exchange for cash or as collateral in support of trading activities. Net unencumbered liquid assets, defined as on-balance sheet assets, su ch\\nas BMO-owned cash and securities and securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, plus other off-balance sheet eligible collateralreceived, less assets encumbered as collateral, totalled $396.3 billion as at October 31, 2024, compared with $357.9 billion as at October 31, 2023.\\nThe increase in unencumbered liquid assets was primarily due to higher securities balances, partially offset by lower cash balances. Net\\nunencumbered liquid assets are primarily held at the parent bank level, at BMO Bank N.A. and in our broker/dealer operations. In addition to liquidassets, we have access to the Bank of Canada’s lending assistance programs, the Federal Reserve Bank discount window in the United States, theBank of England’s Sterling Monetary Framework and European Central Bank standby liquidity facilities. We do not consider central bank facilities asource of available liquidity when assessing the soundness of our liquidity position.\\nIn addition to cash and securities holdings, we may also pledge other assets, including mortgages and loans, to raise long-term secured funding.\\nAs part of the Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework, a Pledging of Assets corporate policy sets out the framework and limits forpledging financial and non-financial assets.\\nBMO’s total encumbered assets and unencumbered liquid assets are summarized in the table below.

Secured and unsecured wholesale funding for liquidtrading assets is largely shorter-term (maturing in one year or less), is aligned with the liquidity of the assets being funded and is subject to limits on\\naggregate maturities across different periods. Supplemental liquidity pools are funded largely with wholesale term funding.\\nWe maintain a large and stable base of customer deposits that, in combination with our strong capital position, is a source of strength. This\\nsupports the maintenance of a sound liquidity position and reduces our reliance on wholesale funding. Customer deposits totalled $715.3 billion asat October 31, 2024, increasing from $654.3 billion in fiscal 2023, driven by strong underlying deposit growth across all business groups.\\nTotal secured and unsecured wholesale funding outstanding, which largely consists of negotiable marketable securities, was $255.5 billion as at\\nOctober 31, 2024, with $67.5 billion sourced as secured funding and $188.0 billion sourced as unsecured funding. Total wholesale funding outstandin g\\ndecreased from $269.6 billion as at October 31, 2023, primarily due to net maturities of wholesale funding during the year. The mix and maturities ofBMO’s wholesale term funding are outlined later in this section. Additional information on deposit maturities can also be found in the ContractualMaturities of Assets and Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments section. We maintain a sizeable portfolio of unencumbered liquid assets,totalling $396.3 billion as at October 31, 2024 and $357.9 billion as at October 31, 2023, that can be monetized to meet potential fundingrequirements, as described in the Unencumbered Liquid Assets section above.\\nWholesale Funding Maturities(1)\\nTABLE 53\\nAs at October 31, 2024 As at October 31, 2023\\n(Canadian $ in millions)Less than\\n1 month1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o1 2\\nmonthsSubtotal less\\nthan 1 year1t o2\\nyearsOver\\n2 years Total Total\\nDeposits from banks 2,531 1,283 556 1,222 5,592 7 – 5,599 7,714\\nCertificates of deposit and commercial\\npaper 12,023 23,099 23,525 30,838 89,485 864 – 90,349 94,372\\nBearer deposit notes 1,437 2,332 462 407 4,638 – – 4,638 954\\nAsset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) 1,702 2,453 5,114 343 9,612 – – 9,612 6,005\\nSenior unsecured medium-term notes 609 5,120 3,096 12,443 21,268 7,374 39,271 67,913 70,749\\nSenior unsecured structured notes (2) – – 14 297 311 498 10,283 11,092 9,415\\nSecured funding\\nMortgage and HELOC securitizations 25 781 909 1,474 3,189 2,752 12,246 18,187 17,916\\nCovered bonds – – – 4,117 4,117 12,267 10,585 26,969 28,412\\nOther asset-backed securitizations (3) ––––– 1,330 5,786 7,116 7,661\\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances – – – 1,460 1,460 1,391 2,782 5,633 18,148\\nSubordinated debt ––––– 2 5 8,378 8,403 8,227\\nTotal 18,327 35,068 33,676 52,601 139,672 26,508 89,331 255,511 269,573\\nOf which:\\nSecured 1,727 3,234 6,023 7,394 18,378 17,740 31,399 67,517 78,142\\nUnsecured 16,600 31,834 27,653 45,207 121,294 8,768 57,932 187,994 191,431\\nTotal (4) 18,327 35,068 33,676 52,601 139,672 26,508 89,331 255,511 269,573\\n(1) Wholesale unsecured funding primarily includes funding raised through the issuance of negotiable marketable securities.

The funding plan\\nconsiders expected maturities, as well as asset and liability growth projected for businesses in our forecasting and planning processes, and assess es\\nfunding needs in relation to the sources available. The plan is reviewed annually by the senior management committees with specific relatedresponsibilities and approved by the RRC, and is regularly updated to reflect actual results and incorporate updated forecast information.\\nRegulatory Developments\\nOSFI has announced proposed changes to its Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline that are expected to become effective in fiscal 2025.Under the proposal, BMO will be required to regularly file reports related to intraday liquidity management with OSFI. These changes are not expectedto have a material impact on our liquidity and funding practices.\\nCredit Ratings\\nThe credit ratings assigned to BMO’s short-term and senior long-term debt securities by external rating agencies are important in raising both capit al\\nand funding to support the bank’s business operations. Maintaining strong credit ratings allows us to access the wholesale markets at competitivepricing levels. Should BMO’s credit ratings experience a downgrade, our cost of funding may increase and our access to funding and capital throughthe wholesale markets could be constrained. A material downgrade of BMO’s ratings could also have other consequences, including those set out inNote 8 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nThe credit ratings assigned to BMO’s senior debt by rating agencies are indicative of high-grade, high-quality issues. In fiscal 2024, Moody’s,\\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P), Fitch and DBRS affirmed their ratings and maintained their stable outlook on BMO.\\nTABLE 54\\nAs at October 31, 2024\\nRating agency Short-term debt Senior debt (1)Long-term deposits /\\nLegacy senior debt (2)Subordinated\\ndebt (NVCC) Outlook\\nMoody’s P-1 A2 Aa2 Baa1 (hyb) Stable\\nS&P A-1 A- A+ BBB+ StableFitch F1+ AA- AA A StableDBRS R-1 (high) AA (low) AA A (low) Stable\\n(1) Subject to conversion under the Bank Recapitalization (Bail-In) Regime.\\n(2) Long-term deposits / Legacy senior debt includes senior debt issued prior to September 23, 2018 and senior debt issued on or after September 23, 201 8 that is excluded from the Bank\\nRecapitalization (Bail-In) Regime.\\nWe are required to deliver collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of BMO’s current credit rating. The incremental collatera l\\nrequired is based on mark-to-market exposure, collateral valuations and collateral threshold arrangements, as applicable. As at October 31, 2024, we\\nwould be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties totalling $189 million, $440 million and $979 million as a result of a one-notch ,\\ntwo-notch and three-notch downgrade, respectively.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 95\\n\\n\\n## Page 84\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio\\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is calculated on a daily basis as the ratio of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) held to total net stressed cash\\noutflows over the next 30 calendar days, in accordance with OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline, and is summarized in the table below.BMO’s HQLA primarily comprises cash, highly-rated debt issued or backed by governments, highly-rated covered bonds and non-financial corporatedebt, and non-financial equities that are part of a major stock index. Net cash flows include outflows from deposits, secured and unsecured wholesalefunding, commitments and potential collateral requirements, offset by permitted inflows from loans, securities lending activities and other non- HQLA\\ndebt maturing over a 30-day horizon. Weightings prescribed by OSFI are applied to cash flows and HQLA to arrive at the weighted values and the LCR.The LCR does not reflect liquidity in BMO Financial Corp. (BFC) in excess of 100%, because of limitations on the transfer of liquidity between BFC andthe parent bank. Canadian domestic systemically important banks, including BMO, are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. The averagedaily LCR for the quarter ended October 31, 2024 was 132%, equivalent to a surplus of $61.0 billion above the regulatory minimum. The LCRincreased 4% from 128% in fiscal 2023, as higher HQLA more than offset an increase in net cash outflows. While banks are required to maintain anLCR of greater than 100% in normal conditions, they are also expected to be able to utilize HQLA during a period of stress, which may result in an LCRof less than 100% during such a period. The LCR is only one measure of a bank’s liquidity position and does not fully capture all of its liquid assets orthe funding alternatives that may be available during a period of stress. BMO’s total liquid assets are shown in the table below.\\nTABLE 55\\nAs at October 31, 2024\\n(Canadian $ in billions, except as noted)Total unweighted value\\n(average) (1) (2)Total weighted value\\n(average) (2) (3)\\nHigh-Quality Liquid Assets\\nTotal high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) * 253.4\\nCash Outflows\\nRetail deposits and deposits from small business customers, of which: 302.3 21.7\\nStable deposits 139.9 4.2\\nLess stable deposits 162.4 17.5\\nUnsecured wholesale funding, of which: 312.7 137.4\\nOperational deposits (all counterparties) and deposits in networks of cooperative banks 153.5 38.0\\nNon-operational deposits (all counterparties) 140.0 80.2\\nUnsecured debt 19.2 19.2\\nSecured wholesale funding * 23.0\\nAdditional requirements, of which: 258.7 52.4\\nOutflows related to derivatives exposures and other collateral requirements 32.4 8.7\\nOutflows related to loss of funding on debt products 2.7 2.7\\nCredit and liquidity facilities 223.6 41.0\\nOther contractual funding obligations 0.8 –\\nOther contingent funding obligations 544.3 11.3\\nTotal cash outflows * 245.8\\nCash Inflows\\nSecured lending (e.g., reverse repos) 164.0 24.1\\nInflows from fully performing exposures 18.1 9.9\\nOther cash inflows 19.4 19.4\\nTotal cash inflows 201.5 53.4\\nTotal adjusted value (4)\\nTotal HQLA 253.4\\nTotal net cash outflows 192.4\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (%) 132\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2023 Total adjusted value (4)\\nTotal HQLA 228.4\\nTotal net cash outflows 178.5\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (%) 128\\n* Disclosure is not required under the LCR disclosure standard.\\n(1) Unweighted values are calculated at market value (for HQLA) or as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflo ws).\\n(2) Values are calculated based on the simple average of the daily LCR over 62 business days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.(3) Weighted values are calculated after the application of the weights prescribed under the OSFI Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline f or HQLA and cash inflows and outflows.\\n(4) Adjusted values are calculated based on total weighted values after applicable caps, as defined in the LAR Guideline.\\n96BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 85\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Net Stable Funding Ratio\\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a regulatory metric that assesses the stability of a bank’s funding profile in relation to the liquidity value of its\\nassets and is calculated in accordance with OSFI’s Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guideline. Unlike the LCR, which is a short-term metric, the NSFRassesses a bank’s medium-term and long-term resilience. The NSFR is defined as the ratio of the amount of available stable funding (ASF) to theamount of required stable funding (RSF). ASF represents the proportion of own and third-party resources that are expected to be reliably available toa bank over a one-year time horizon (including customer deposits, long-term wholesale funding and capital). The stable funding requirements foreach institution are set by OSFI based on the liquidity and maturity characteristics of its balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures.Weightings prescribed by OSFI are applied to notional asset and liability balances to determine ASF, RSF and the NSFR. Canadian domestic systemicall y\\nimportant banks, including BMO, are required to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%. BMO’s NSFR was 117% as at October 31, 2024, equivalent to asurplus of $115.4 billion above the regulatory minimum. The NSFR increased from 115% as at October 31, 2023, as higher ASF more than offset theincrease in RSF.\\nTABLE 56\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2024\\nUnweighted value by residual maturity\\nWeighted\\nvalue (2) (Canadian $ in billions, except as noted)No\\nmaturity (1)Less than 6\\nmonths6t o1 2\\nmonths Over 1 year\\nAvailable Stable Funding (ASF) Item\\nCapital: – – – 95.4 95.4\\nRegulatory capital – – – 95.4 95.4\\nOther capital instruments –– –– –\\nRetail deposits and deposits from small business customers: 227.4 70.2 41.8 74.4 379.8\\nStable deposits 114.2 27.5 17.3 15.4 166.5\\nLess stable deposits 113.2 42.7 24.5 59.0 213.3\\nWholesale funding: 310.0 275.0 66.4 106.4 293.0\\nOperational deposits 151.0 – – – 75.5\\nOther wholesale funding 159.0 275.0 66.4 106.4 217.5\\nLiabilities with matching interdependent assets – 1.3 0.6 13.9 –\\nOther liabilities: 3.0 * * 77.5 20.5\\nNSFR derivative liabilities ** * 5 . 3 *\\nAll other liabilities and equity not included in the above categories 3.0 51.5 0.3 20.4 20.5\\nTotal ASF * * * * 788.7\\nRequired Stable Funding (RSF) Item\\nTotal NSFR high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) * * * * 18.5\\nDeposits held at other financial institutions for operational purposes – 0.2 – – 0.1\\nPerforming loans and securities: 202.3 211.3 74.3 362.1 538.3\\nPerforming loans to financial institutions secured by Level 1 HQLA – 94.1 3.2 – 4.0\\nPerforming loans to financial institutions secured by non-Level 1 HQLA and unsecured\\nperforming loans to financial institutions 32.0 61.5 8.7 21.3 65.0\\nPerforming loans to non-financial corporate clients, loans to retail and small business\\ncustomers, and loans to sovereigns, central banks and public sector entities, of which: 124.8 39.4 44.3 167.8 287.9\\nWith a risk weight of less than or equal to 35% under the Basel II standardized approach\\nfor credit risk –– –– –\\nPerforming residential mortgages, of which: 13.6 13.8 17.7 143.7 127.9\\nWith a risk weight of less than or equal to 35% under the Basel II standardized\\napproach for credit risk 13.6 13.8 17.7 143.7 127.9\\nSecurities that are not in default and do not qualify as HQLA, including exchange-traded equities 31.9 2.5 0.4 29.3 53.5\\nAssets with matching interdependent liabilities – 1.3 0.6 13.9 –\\nOther assets: 46.6 * * 101.7 94.6\\nPhysical traded commodities, including gold 9.5 * * * 8.1\\nAssets posted as initial margin for derivative contracts and contributions to default\\nfunds of CCPs * * * 17.7 15.0\\nNSFR derivative assets * * * 3.8 –\\nNSFR derivative liabilities before deduction of variation margin posted * * * 14.6 0.7\\nAll other assets not included in the above categories 37.1 41.0 0.3 24.3 70.8\\nOff-balance sheet items – – – 623.3 21.8\\nTotal RSF * * * * 673.3\\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (%) * * * * 117\\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2023Weighted\\nvalue (2)\\nTotal ASF 724.1\\nTotal RSF 627.8\\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (%) 115\\n* Disclosure is not required under the NSFR disclosure standard.\\n(1) Items in the no maturity column do not have a stated maturity.

The\\ncontractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities is an input to, but is not necessarily consistent with, the expected maturity of assets andliabilities that is used in the management of liquidity and funding risk. We forecast asset and liability cash flows, under both normal marketconditions and a number of stress scenarios to manage liquidity and funding risk. Stress scenarios incorporate assumptions for loan repayments,deposit withdrawals, and credit commitment and liquidity facility drawdowns by counterparty and product type. Stress scenarios also consider thetime horizon over which liquid assets can be monetized and the related discounts (“haircuts”) and potential collateral requirements that may arisefrom both market volatility and credit rating downgrades, among other assumptions.\\nTABLE 57\\n2024\\n(Canadian $ in millions)0t o1\\nmonth1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o9\\nmonths9t o1 2\\nmonths1t o2\\nyears2t o5\\nyearsOver 5\\nyearsNo\\nmaturity Total\\nOn-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\\nAssets\\nCash and cash equivalents 62,827 ––––––– 2,271 65,098\\nInterest bearing deposits with banks 2,513 628 481 18 – – – – – 3,640\\nSecurities 6,787 14,011 7,840 6,707 9,720 21,264 84,775 172,886 72,890 396,880\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under\\nresale agreements 85,185 16,803 5,701 2,330 888 – – – – 110,907\\nLoans (1)\\nResidential mortgages 1,683 3,284 6,413 6,653 9,252 52,489 77,867 33,227 212 191,080\\nConsumer instalment and other personal 581 974 1,703 1,827 2,671 14,815 24,595 18,830 26,691 92,687\\nCredit cards –––––––– 13,612 13,612\\nBusiness and government 8,647 14,418 16,461 19,448 21,828 63,613 105,740 32,444 102,394 384,993\\nAllowance for credit losses –––––––– (4,356) (4,356)\\nTotal loans, net of allowance 10,911 18,676 24,577 27,928 33,751 130,917 208,202 84,501 138,553 678,016\\nOther assets\\nDerivative instruments 5,573 7,996 7,211 2,482 1,660 6,365 8,374 7,592 – 47,253\\nCustomers’ liabilities under acceptances 3 5 9–––––––– 3 5 9\\nReceivable from brokers, dealers and\\nclients 31,916 –––––––– 31,916\\nOther 3,847 1,012 948 31 14 13 13 7,717 61,983 75,578\\nTotal other assets 41,695 9,008 8,159 2,513 1,674 6,378 8,387 15,309 61,983 155,106\\nTotal assets 209,918 59,126 46,758 39,496 46,033 158,559 301,364 272,696 275,697 1,409,647\\nTABLE 58\\n2024\\n(Canadian $ in millions)0t o1\\nmonth1t o3\\nmonths3t o6\\nmonths6t o9\\nmonths9t o1 2\\nmonths1t o2\\nyears2t o5\\nyearsOver 5\\nyearsNo\\nmaturity Total\\nLiabilities and Equity\\nDeposits (2) (3) 47,637 74,759 69,479 68,110 48,835 51,789 87,297 25,602 508,932 982,440\\nOther liabilities\\nDerivative instruments 6,769 10,541 10,828 3,311 2,160 6,470 9,112 9,112 – 58,303\\nAcceptances 3 5 9–––––––– 3 5 9\\nSecurities sold but not yet purchased (4) 35,030 –––––––– 35,030\\nSecurities lent or sold under repurchase\\nagreements (4) 99,364 7,777 721 106 1,016 1,807 – – – 110,791\\nSecuritization and structured entities’\\nliabilities 44 981 1,072 2,183 152 4,353 9,913 21,466 – 40,164\\nInsurance-related liabilities 93 89 18 18 30 83 195 701 17,543 18,770\\nPayable to brokers, dealers and clients 34,407 –––––––– 34,407\\nOther 12,409 2,968 805 144 1,611 2,492 4,058 2,799 9,434 36,720\\nTotal other liabilities 188,475 22,356 13,444 5,762 4,969 15,205 23,278 34,078 26,977 334,544\\nSubordinated debt ––––– 2 5 2 5 8,327 – 8,377\\nTotal equity –––––––– 84,286 84,286\\nTotal liabilities and equity 236,112 97,115 82,923 73,872 53,804 67,019 110,600 68,007 620,195 1,409,647\\n(1) Loans receivable on demand have been included under no maturity.\\n(2) Deposits payable on demand and payable after notice have been included under no maturity.(3) Deposits totalling $29,136 million as at October 31, 2024 have a fixed maturity date; however, they can be redeemed early (either fully or partiall y) by customers without penalty.

These losses can stem from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, humanerror or misconduct, and external events that may directly or indirectly impact the fair value of assets we hold in our credit or investmentportfolios. Examples of these risks include cyber and information security risk, technology risk, fraud risk and business continuity risk, but excl ude\\nlegal and regulatory risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and other types of financial risk.\\nOperational non-financial risk (ONFR) is inherent in all our business and banking activities and can lead to significant impacts on our operating and\\nfinancial results, including financial loss, restatements of financial results and damage to BMO’s reputation. Like other financial service organ izations,\\nwe are exposed to a variety of operational risks arising from potential failure of our internal processes, technology systems and employees, as wellas from external threats. Potential losses may be the result of process and control failures, unauthorized transactions by employees, businessdisruption, information security breaches, theft or fraud and cyber security threats, exposure to risks related to third-party relationships and d amage\\nto physical assets. For example, given the large volume of transactions that we process daily and the complexity and speed of our businessoperations, it is possible that certain operational or human errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.\\nONFR is not only inherent in our business and banking activities, it is also inherent in the processes and controls we use to manage risks. There is\\nthe possibility that errors could occur, as well as the possibility that a failure in our internal processes or systems could lead to a failure to manage or\\nmitigate risk, financial loss and reputational harm. Shortcomings or failures of internal processes, systems or employees, or of services and produ cts\\nprovided by third parties, including any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems, could lead to financial loss, restatements o f\\nfinancial results and damage to BMO’s reputation.\\nThe nature of our business activities also exposes us to the risk of theft and fraud when we transact with customers or counterparties. BMO relies\\non the accuracy and completeness of any information provided by, and any other representations made by, customers and counterparties. While weconduct due diligence in relation to such customer information and, where practicable and economically feasible, engage valuation experts and othe r\\nexperts or sources of information to assist in assessing the value of collateral and other customer risks, our financial results may be adverselyimpacted if the information provided by customers or counterparties is materially misleading and this is not discovered during the due diligenceprocess.\\nWe have established various risk management frameworks to manage and mitigate these risks, including internal controls, limits and\\ngovernance processes. However, despite the contingency plans we have in place to maintain our ability to serve our clients and minimize disruptionsand adverse impacts, and the contingency plans of our third-party service providers, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by adisruption to the infrastructure that supports our operations and the communities in which we do business, including, but not limited to, disruptioncaused by public health or other emergencies, civil disorder, acts of war or terrorism.\\nWe regularly review top and emerging risk exposures that could impact BMO’s business and operations, and we assess our preparedness to\\nproactively manage the risks we face or could face in the future. Consistent with the management of risk across the enterprise, we employ a three-lines-of-defence approach in managing our exposures to non-financial risk.\\nRefer to the Risks That May Affect Future Results – Top and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results section for further discussion of these\\nrisks.\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Governance\\nThe Operational Risk Committee (ORC), a sub-committee of the Risk Management Committee (RMC), is the primary governance committee exercisingoversight of all operational non-financial risk management matters, including: providing direction on, and monitoring against, strategic object ives and\\ndeliverables; and improving operational resilience, with the objective of maintaining BMO’s reputation for preventing avoidable operating failu res and\\nmistakes. As part of its governance responsibilities, the ORC reviews and recommends corporate policies and standards to the Risk Review Committee(RRC), the RMC and senior executives for review and approval as required, as well as the methodologies and tools that comprise the governingprinciples of the Operational Non-Financial Risk Management (ONFRM) framework. The documentation that gives effect to these governing principlesis reviewed on a regular basis in order to confirm that it incorporates sound governance practices and is consistent with BMO’s risk appetite. Regularanalysis and reporting of our enterprise operational risk profile to the various committees (ORC, RMC and RRC) are important elements of our riskgovernance framework. Operational risk reporting provides an integrated view of top and emerging risks, trends in loss data, capital consumption,key risk indicators (KRIs) and operating group profiles. We continue to invest in our reporting platforms, supporting timely and comprehensivereporting capabilities in order to enhance risk transparency and facilitate the proactive management of operational risk exposures.\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Management\\nAs the first line of defence, the operating groups and Corporate Services are accountable for the day-to-day management of non-financial risk,including the Chief Risk Officers of our businesses, who provide governance and oversight for their respective business units, along with CorporateServices, which provides additional governance and oversight in certain targeted areas. Operational Risk Officers independently assess the opera tional\\nrisk profiles of our operating groups, identify material exposures and potential weaknesses in our product, service and process-based risk and cont rol\\nenvironment, and recommend appropriate mitigation strategies and actions.\\nIndependent risk management oversight is provided by ONFRM, which is responsible for developing and implementing effective risk-related\\nstrategies, tools and policies, and for exercising second-line oversight, effective challenge and governance. ONFR sets out and maintains the ONFR M\\nframework, which defines the processes to be used by the first line of defence to identify, assess, manage, monitor, mitigate and report on keyoperational risk exposures, losses and near-miss operational risk events with significant potential impact. In addition, the ONFRM framework sets out\\nthe processes by which ONFRM, as the second line of defence, guides, supports, monitors, assesses and communicates with the first line in itsmanagement of operational non-financial risks.\\n100 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 89', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 11, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667361', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 89\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Implementing the governing principles of the ONFRM framework also involves continuing to strengthen our risk culture and reinforce ethical and\\nresponsible behaviour by setting clear expectations from leadership, promoting greater awareness and understanding of non-financial risk across all\\nthree lines of defence, learning from loss events and near-misses, providing related training and communication, and aiming to ensure effectivepositive reinforcement and consequence management. BMO’s Board of Directors has overall accountability for BMO’s culture. We continue tostrengthen our second-line-of-defence support and oversight capabilities with an enhanced Operational Non-Financial Risk Operating Model, whic h\\ntakes a differentiated approach based on the nature of the underlying risk and existing organizational structures.\\nThrough the implementation and oversight of the ONFRM framework, we seek to maintain an operational risk profile that is consistent with our\\nrisk appetite and supported by adequate capital, and reflects our commitment to an ethical culture defined by BMO’s values, including integrity andresponsible risk management, reinforced by enhanced operational resilience. Operational resilience is an organization’s ability to protect and s ustain\\ncore business products and services that are essential for its clients, both during the normal course of business and when experiencing operationalstress or disruption. It involves the ability to deal with unpredictable events and adapt to changes and external circumstances, and is an outcome ofeffective management of ONFR. Operational resilience is a positive, forward-looking strategic positioning that allows us to take measured risks wi th\\nconfidence and prepare BMO to withstand challenges in the market arising from both expected and unexpected events.\\nIn August 2024, OSFI released Guideline E-21, which sets out revised operational risk management and new operational resilience requirements\\nfor financial institutions. We are further enhancing our program to comply with these requirements by September 2026.\\nThe following are the key programs, methodologies and processes set out in the ONFRM framework that assist us in the ongoing review of our\\noperational non-financial risk profile:\\n‰BMO has transitioned to a new program for the assessment of non-financial risk, known as Product/Service and Process Risk Assessment . This\\nprogram is used by our operating groups and Corporate Services to assess the controls and residual risk exposures in their business operations byfocusing on the key controls applied to their products, services, internal activities and processes. It provides a current and forward-looking view of\\nthe impact of both our internal controls and the external business environment on the risk profiles of our operating groups and Corporate Services,supporting the proactive identification, assessment, management, monitoring and mitigation of risk.\\n‰BMO’s Initiative Assessment and Approval Process is used to assess, document and approve new products and services when a new business,\\nproduct or service is developed, or existing products and services are enhanced, as well as review projects which could impact the existing controlenvironment. This process supports continuous oversight of change in risk exposure by setting out specific requirements for due diligence, approva l,\\nmonitoring and reporting that apply at all levels of the organization.\\n‰Material trends, metrics and risk assessments comprising Key Risk Indicators, Issues Management andInternal Loss Data Events are integral\\ncomponents of an operational risk profile and are utilized to assess specific risk exposures in relation to BMO’s overall risk appetite.\\n‰Historical Internal Loss Data Events are recorded and maintained within the bank’s central operational risk platform. Our policies and standards\\nrequire the timely, concise and accurate reporting of events, including second line effective challenge. Root cause analysis is undertaken onmaterial events and loss data is monitored based on the bank’s risk appetite.\\n‰Operational Risk Capital Measurement : The bank’s operational risk capital is determined using the Basel III Standardized Approach (SA), which is\\na product of the Business Indicator Component (BIC) and Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM). BIC is a financial statement-based proxy representing activ ity\\nwithin the bank and ILM is a proxy representing the control environment relative to activity. ILM is a mathematical calculation based on 10-yearaverage historical losses (net of recoveries) and the three-year average BIC.\\n‰Stress Testing Scenario Analysis assesses the potential impact of severe, hypothetical but plausible scenarios covering material and emerging\\nrisks, as well as critical business processes at the bank. Results of the stress test scenarios are leveraged to derive operational loss projections t hat\\nmay be used for risk management (understanding areas of concentration, susceptibility, prioritizing incremental risk mitigation strategies, etc .) and\\nrisk measurement (understanding exposures, benchmarking, developing KRIs, controls and supporting regulatory stress submissions).\\n‰BMO’s Corporate Risk & Insurance (CR&I) group provides a second layer of mitigation for certain operational risk exposures. CR&I is also\\naccountable for establishing and maintaining the enterprise-wide insurance program. We purchase insurance when required by law, regulation orcontractual agreement, and when it is economically attractive and practicable to mitigate our risks, in order to provide adequate protection agains t\\nunexpected material loss. The policy structures and coverage provisions of our insurance positions are assessed annually to confirm alignment withBMO’s overall risk tolerance.\\n‰BMO is evolving its approach to overseeing payment risk by horizontally assessing both financial and non-financial risks, which can arise at anystage in the end-to-end life cycle of its products and services.\\nThe following are some of the operational non-financial risks that may adversely affect BMO’s business and financial results.\\nAnti-Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Risk\\nMoney laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risks are associated wi th laundering the proceeds of crime, financing terrorist activity or vi olating\\neconomic sanctions by making use of the bank’s products or services. Complia nce with applicable anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing ( AML/\\nATF) and sanctions measures is critical to safeguarding BMO, our custo mers and the communities in which we operate. We are committed to managing\\nAML/ATF and sanctions risks effectively, and to complying with releva nt laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\\nconsequences of non-compliance with these requirements include legal pr oceedings, financial losses, regulatory enforcement actions, sanctions and\\nfines, criminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or a n inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in investor and customer\\nconfidence, and damage to our reputation. Under the direction of the Chie f Anti-Money Laundering Officer (CAMLO), BMO’s enterprise AML/ATF and\\nsanctions compliance program promotes effective governance and oversi ght across all of our businesses, and sets out policies, risk assessments, du e\\ndiligence processes and controls and training, including targeted train ing and mandatory annual training for all employees. BMO’s compliance prog ram\\napplies data analytics, technology and professional expertise in order to deter, detect and report suspicious activity. BMO has implemented a\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 101\\n\\n\\n## Page 90\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nKnow-Your-Customer program which aims to understand who its customers ar e, as well as the beneficial ownership of entities holding BMO products. In\\naddition, customers and transactions are routinely screened against curre nt sanctions, terrorist and other designated watch lists. The CAMLO repo rts\\nregularly to the Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Boar d of Directors and to senior management on the effectiveness of the\\ncompliance program. The effectiveness of our AML/ATF and sanctions comp liance program is subject to regular review and independent assessment by\\nthe Corporate Audit Division. We remain committed to effective com pliance and the ongoing effort to protect the financial system.\\nArtificial Intelligence Risk\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) risk arises from the development, implementation and incorrect or biased use of AI systems, including machine learnin g\\n(ML) and generative AI system outputs, which may lead to financial loss, poor customer experiences and damage to our reputation.\\nThe AI capabilities available to the industry have been evolving at unprecedented speed, highlighting new opportunities for innovation across a\\nbroad range of products and services. AI is expected to become a key driver of future operating efficiencies, but only if we adopt and integrate newtechnologies in a safe and responsible manner. Our use of AI has the potential to pose risks to the organization that overlap existing riskmanagement frameworks (e.g., model risk). These AI risks may be exacerbated by the scale, scope and processing speed of AI, or can take novelforms. In addition, the use of AI outside of BMO can complicate the threat landscape and could impact other risk frameworks which are evolving tomeet these more complex threats.\\nOur management and oversight of AI risk, including risks arising from the use of generative AI, are consistent with our ERMF, employ our three-\\nlines-of-defence model and consider industry standard frameworks and existing regulatory requirements such as privacy laws. Significant AIinitiatives are reviewed by a cross-functional group before implementation, which considers potential risks and adverse impacts, including unfai ro r\\nbiased output from AI systems, and measures to mitigate such risks. We are focused on advancing our commitment to serving our customers in a waythat fosters confidence and trust in our fair, secure, transparent and ethical use of these technologies, utilizing our risk management practices, o ur\\nglobal privacy principles and our internal safeguards, such as oversight, monitoring and testing, to employ AI responsibly. Our approach to theresponsible use of AI, including generative AI, continues to evolve and adapt to ongoing regulatory developments in the jurisdictions in which weoperate.\\nBusiness Continuity Risk\\nBusiness continuity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to maintain, continue or restore essential business operations during and /\\nor after an event that prevents BMO from conducting business in the normal course.\\nBusiness continuity management should enable BMO to recover, maintain and manage critical processes, as well as safeguard the interests and\\nwell-being of our customers, shareholders and employees. In the event of an operational disruption, effective business continuity plans aim tominimize adverse impacts on our customers, employees and other interested parties. These operational disruptions could result from severe weather ,\\ntechnology failures, cyber attacks or any other event that can lead to process failure. We have a framework in place that facilitates the rapid recover y\\nand timely resumption of critical operations, including availability of our people, processes, facilities and technology, and maintenance of our t hird-\\nparty relationships. Our comprehensive business continuity management strategy involves developing, testing and maintaining recovery strategi es\\nand plans with the objective that critical processes and third-party relationships remain resilient throughout any disruption.\\nCyber and Information Security Risk\\nCyber and information security risk arises from the possibility that BMO’s business could be materially affected by security incidents, including t he\\nloss, theft or misuse of information, including all types of data (e.g., client data, employee data and the organization’s proprietary data), as well as\\nany potential failure to comply with rules concerning information or cyber security. We are the target of attempted cyber attacks and mustcontinuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure, as well as access to and th e\\nsecurity of our data. Any resulting data breaches may lead to exposure or loss of data, including customer or employee information and the bank’sstrategic or other sensitive internal information, and could result in identity theft, fraud or business losses. Cyber attacks could result in syste m\\nfailures and disruption of services, and expose the bank to litigation and regulatory risk, as well as reputational harm. Threat campaigns are becomi ng\\nmore sophisticated and well-organized, and often take place through third-party suppliers, which can negatively impact our business, brand andreputation, as well as customer retention and acquisition. Due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective serviceproviders), central agents, exchanges, clearing-houses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of these are subjec tt oa\\nsuccessful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the thirdparty or result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client, employee or other confidential information, which could interrupt our business an d\\nadversely affect our operations and reputation.\\nCyber and information security is critical to the delivery of the bank’s strategies, initiatives and goals. As technology evolves rapidly and the\\nconnective capabilities of digital devices continue to grow, cyber threats and risks also evolve. These threats include breaches of, or disruptions to,\\nour systems or operations, as well as unauthorized access to, or use or dissemination of, information pertaining to BMO, our customers or employees.At BMO, our response includes investing in our Financial Crimes Unit and technological infrastructure, equipping our team to detect and address cybe r\\nsecurity threats across North America, Europe and Asia. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not beable to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, as the techniques used are increasingly sophistic ated,\\nchange frequently and are often not recognized until launched. As a result of these risks, we could become subject to legal or regulatory action,reputational and operational harm, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against, or not fully covered through any insurancemaintained by BMO.\\n102 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 91\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Data and Analytics Risk\\nData and analytics risk arises from the possibility of loss or harm from the inadequate or failed identification, management, accuracy or timeliness of\\nstructured or unstructured data used to support business processes and decision-making, including analytics. Data quality, governance andarchitecture impact our understanding and management of BMO’s data assets and the data quality of analytical output.\\nWe continue to invest in new capabilities in support of BMO’s digital transformation. Our ability to effectively manage and safeguard critical data\\nhas a direct impact on our successful deployment of digital processes and our ability to develop and introduce innovative new capabilities with toolsand systems driven by AI. Our management of data and analytics risk is focused on the quality, resilience, retention and governance of BMO’s dataassets, which are foundational to our business operations, strategy and future growth, including BMO’s Digital First strategy.\\nFraud and Physical Security Risk\\nFraud risk arises from the possibility that an intentional act, misstatement or omission designed to deceive others may result in the intended targetexperiencing a loss or the perpetrator achieving a gain. Fraud may be perpetrated by our employees, suppliers or other external parties, includingBMO customers. Fraudsters continue to target the financial industry with increasingly sophisticated methods that facilitate fraud and remit funds to\\nfraudulent accounts. BMO maintains a Fraud Risk Management program intended to proactively manage fraud risks across the bank.\\nThe management of physical security risk seeks to ensure that the bank, its customers, employees and third parties are protected against the risk\\nof loss, interference, unauthorized physical access, damage or injury to which they may be exposed as a result of the bank’s operations. Physicalsecurity risks may emerge through various threat vectors, including criminal activities, terrorist attacks, sociopolitical unrest, human error, natural\\ndisasters and/or geopolitical threats. Physical security measures may also support the management of other risks, including risks related toinformation security, privacy and fraud.\\nProject and Change Management Risk\\nProject and change management risk is the risk of loss arising from the possibility that BMO could experience a loss due to substandard delivery of aninitiative that may result in the business not achieving its intended outcome, as well as attracting additional regulatory scrutiny.\\nThe bank has established a Project and Change Management Risk Framework to drive consistency in the delivery of an initiative within a\\nprescribed control environment. This framework outlines the principles and processes for providing governance, monitoring and reporting, as well as\\nthe roles and responsibilities necessary to address project and change management risk across the enterprise in order to meet or exceed theexpectations of interested parties.\\nTechnology Risk\\nTechnology risk, including risks related to emerging technology and digital platforms, is the possibility that the inadequacy, misuse, disruption or\\nfailure of information technology systems, infrastructure or data could result in an inability to meet business needs. Technology risk managementmeasures are intended to protect BMO’s systems, data and assets, and help safeguard their confidentiality, integrity and availability. As the adopt ion\\nof digital banking channels continues to grow, we continue to invest in new and innovative technological capabilities in order to meet our customers’expectations and keep their data secure. In alignment with our operational risk management framework, we follow a program that addressesexposures to technology risk, supported by a team of technology risk management experts.\\nThird-Party Risk\\nThird-party risk is the risk of loss associated with an entity failing to provide goods, business activities, functions and/or services, failing to p rotect\\ndata or systems of the bank, or exposing BMO to other negative outcomes. BMO’s third-party risk management (TPRM) framework sets therequirements for the identification, assessment, management, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of third-party risk across the third-party li fe cycle.\\nThis framework is supported by a centrally maintained TPRM program.\\nWe continue to enhance and evolve our capabilities in order to maintain robust risk management practices, support operational resilience\\nobjectives and comply with regulatory requirements.\\nFor further discussion of third-party risk, refer to the Cyber and Information Security section.\\nModel Risk\\nModel Risk is the potential for adverse outcomes resulting from decisions that are based on incorrect or misused model results. These adverse\\noutcomes can include financial loss, poor business decision-making and damage to reputation.\\nModel risk arises from the use of quantitative analytical tools that apply statistical, mathematical, economic, algorithmic or other advanced\\ntechniques, such as AI and ML, to process input data and generate quantitative output or estimates. These analytical tools range from very simplequantitative methods that produce straightforward estimates to highly sophisticated models that can be used to value complex transactions orprovide a broad range of forward-looking estimates. These analytical tools generate results that can inform business, risk and capital managementdecision-making, and assist in making daily lending, trading, underwriting, funding, investment and operational decisions.\\nThese analytical tools provide important insights and are effective when used within a framework that identifies key assumptions and\\nlimitations, while controlling and mitigating model risk. In addition to applying judgment to evaluate the reliability of model results, we mitigat e\\nmodel risk by maintaining strong controls over the development, validation, implementation and use of all models across the enterprise. We alsoseek to ensure that other analytical tools, including critical calculations and other estimation approaches, such as model overlays used for keybusiness decision-making, are intuitive, experience-based, well-documented and subject to effective challenge by employees, who have sufficien t\\nexpertise and knowledge in order to deliver reasonable results.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 103\\n\\n\\n## Page 92\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nModel Risk Management Framework\\nRisk is inherent in models because model results are estimates that rely on statistical, mathematical or other quantitative techniques to approxima te\\nreality and transform data into estimates or forecasts of future outcomes. Model risk also arises from the potential misuse of models or model results .\\nModel risk is governed at BMO by a risk-based enterprise-wide Model Risk Management Framework.\\nInitiation &\\nIdentification123 67 4Model Life Cycle\\nDevelopment Validation ImplementationUse &\\nMaintenanceOngoing\\nMonitoring\\n& ValidationDecommission5\\nThe Model Risk Management Framework sets out an end-to-end approach for model risk governance across the model life cycle and for the\\nmanagement of model risk within the limits of our risk appetite. The framework includes BMO’s Model Risk Corporate Policy, Model Risk Guidelinesand supporting operating procedures, which outline the governing principles for managing model risk, describe model risk management processes indetail and define the roles and responsibilities of interested parties across the model life cycle. Model owners, developers and users serve as the fi rst\\nline of defence, while the Model Risk Management group is the second line of defence and the Corporate Audit Division is the third line of defence.\\nOur Model Risk Management group is responsible for developing and maintaining our Model Risk Management Framework in alignment with\\nregulatory expectations, as well as for exercising oversight of the effectiveness of model processes, model inventory and the overall aggregation,assessment and reporting of model risk. This framework incorporates guidance on the management of risks, the safe and responsible adoption ofadvances in automation used for decision-making, such as large language models and algorithmic trading, as well as other AI and ML applications. Ourenterprise Model Risk Management Committee (MRMC), a sub-committee of the RMC, is a cross-functional group representing interested parties acrossthe enterprise. The MRMC meets regularly to help direct BMO’s use of models, oversee the development, implementation and maintenance of theModel Risk Management Framework, provide effective challenge and discuss governance of the enterprise’s models.\\nOutcomes Analysis and Back-TestingOnce models are validated, approved and in use, they are subject to ongoing monitoring, including outcomes analysis, at varying frequencies. As akey component of outcomes analysis, back-testing compares model results against actual observed outcomes. Variances between model forecastsand actual observed outcomes are measured against defined risk materiality thresholds and tolerance ranges, which may result in further steps beingtaken, such as model review and parameter recalibration, as appropriate. This analysis serves to confirm the validity of a model’s performance overtime. Controls are in place to address identified issues and enhance our models’ overall performance.\\nAll models used within BMO, including models that incorporate AI and ML techniques, are subject to validation and ongoing monitoring to\\nconfirm that they are being used in alignment with our framework and in compliance with regulatory expectations, such as those related to ethics,privacy, fairness and explainability. This framework applies to a wide variety of models, ranging from market, credit and non-financial risk models to\\nstress testing, pricing and valuation, and anti-money laundering models.\\nCautionThis Operational Non-Financial Risk section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Stateme nts.\\nLegal and Regulatory Risk\\nLegal and Regulatory Risk is the potential for loss or harm resulting from failure to comply with laws or satisfy contractual obligations or\\nregulatory requirements. This includes the risk arising from any failure to: comply with the law (in letter or in spirit) or maintain standards of care ;\\nimplement legal or regulatory requirements; enforce or comply with contractual terms; assert non-contractual rights; effectively manage dispute s;\\nor act in a manner so as to maintain our reputation.\\nThe success of BMO’s business operations relies in part on our ability to manage our exposure to legal and regulatory risk. The financial services\\nindustry is highly regulated and subject to strict enforcement of legal and regulatory requirements. Banks globally continue to be subject to fines a nd\\nother penalties for a number of regulatory and conduct issues. We are exposed to risks in connection with regulatory and governmental inquiries,investigations and enforcement actions, as well as criminal prosecutions. As rulemaking and supervisory expectations continue to evolve, we monit or\\ndevelopments to enable BMO to respond by implementing changes as required.\\nUnder the direction of BMO’s General Counsel, our Legal & Regulatory Compliance group maintains enterprise-wide frameworks that set out the\\nsteps to be taken to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on exposure to legal and regulatory risk. We identify applicable laws andregulations and potential risks, recommend mitigation measures and strategies, conduct internal investigations, and oversee legal proceedings a nd\\nenforcement actions, including civil claims and litigation, criminal charges, and regulatory examinations and audits.\\nHeightened regulatory and supervisory scrutiny has a significant impact on the way we conduct business. Working with the operating groups and\\nCorporate Services, Legal & Regulatory Compliance assesses and analyzes the implications of changes in regulatory and supervisory expectations. W e\\ndevote substantial resources to the implementation of systems and processes required to comply with new regulations. Failure to comply withapplicable legal and regulatory requirements may lead to legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions or fines, enforcement actions ,\\ncriminal convictions and penalties, operational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business strategies, a decline in investor and cus tomer\\nconfidence, and damage to our reputation. Certain businesses are also subject to fiduciary requirements, including policies and practices that add ress\\nthe responsibilities of a business to a customer, such as service requirements and expectations, customer suitability determinations, disclosureobligations and communications.\\n104 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 93\\n\\n                          MD&A                          BMO is subject to legal proceedings, including investigations by regulators, arising in the ordinary course of business, and the unfavourable\\nresolution of any such legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow s,\\ncapital position or credit ratings; require material changes in our operations; result in operational restrictions or an inability to execute certa in business\\nstrategies; result in loss of customers; and damage our reputation. The volume of legal proceedings and the amount of damages and penaltiesassessed in such legal proceedings could grow in the future. Information regarding material legal proceedings to which we are a party is included inthe Legal Proceedings section in Note 25 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements. Our disclosure controls and procedures are intend ed\\nto provide reasonable assurance that relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, so that appropriatedecisions can be made regarding public disclosure. In assessing the materiality of legal proceedings, factors considered include a case-by-caseassessment of specific facts and circumstances, our past experience and the opinions of legal experts. However, some legal proceedings may behighly complex, and may include novel or untested legal claims or theories. The outcome of such proceedings may be difficult to anticipate until latein the proceedings, which may last several years.\\nBMO’s Anti-Corruption Office, through its global program, has articulated key principles and procedures that support the effective oversight of\\ncompliance with anti-corruption legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These include guidance on identifying, avoiding and reporti ng on\\ncorrupt practices and rigorously investigating allegations of corrupt activity. Evolving competition or antitrust risk is managed globally throu gh BMO’s\\nCompetition/Antitrust Office, which is responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of a compliance program that supports theoversight of competition/antitrust laws or regulatory expectations.\\nGovernments and regulators around the world continue to focus on anti-mon ey laundering and related concerns, raising their expectations for the\\nquality and efficacy of anti-money laundering programs and penalizing i nstitutions that fail to meet these expectations. Failure to meet these\\nexpectations may lead to legal proceedings, financial losses, regulatory sanctions or fines, enforcement actions, criminal convictions and penal ties,\\noperational restrictions or an inability to execute certain business stra tegies, a decline in investor and customer confidence, and damage to our\\nreputation. Under the direction of the Chief Anti-Money Laundering Offi cer (CAMLO), BMO’s Anti-Money Laundering Office is responsible for the\\nassessment, governance and oversight of the principles and procedures th at support the effective oversight of compliance with laws and regulations\\nand internal risk parameters related to anti-money laundering, anti-terr orist financing and sanctions measures. For further discussion, refer to the\\nOperational Non-Financial Risk Management – Anti-Money Lau ndering, Terrorist Financing and Sanctions Risk section.\\nBMO has built its reputation on a strong foundation of ethical business practices, a client service culture and our track record of responsible risk\\nmanagement. We have adopted a wide range of practices, in addition to BMO’s Code of Conduct, to support the ethical conduct of our employees andBoard of Directors and mitigate the risk of potential misconduct. Misconduct is behaviour that falls short of legal, professional, internal conduct and\\nethical standards. Acting with integrity and competing ethically and responsibly support our focus on maintaining a strong risk culture. For furthe r\\ndiscussion, refer to the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework – Risk Culture section.\\nAll of these frameworks reflect the three-lines-of-defence operating model described previously. The operating groups and Corporate Services\\nmanage day-to-day risks by implementing and monitoring corporate policies and standards, while Legal & Regulatory Compliance units specificallyassigned to each of the operating groups provide advice and independent legal and regulatory risk management oversight.\\nThe General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer regularly report to the Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) of the Board of\\nDirectors and senior management on the effectiveness of our enterprise compliance program. The program takes a risk-based approach to identify,assess and manage any risks related to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and directs operating groups and Corporate Services tomaintain policies, procedures and controls that address these laws and regulations. Under the direction of the Chief Compliance Officer, we identif y\\nand report on gaps and deficiencies, and we track remedial action plans. The CAMLO also regularly reports to the ACRC.\\nAll BMO employees must regularly complete legal and regulatory training on topics such as anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, competition/\\nantitrust and privacy policies, standards and directives. This is carried out in conjunction with our Code of Conduct training, which tests employee s’\\nknowledge and understanding of the behaviour required of BMO employees.\\nWe continue to respond to other global regulatory developments, including the impact of changes in capital and liquidity requirements. These\\ndevelopments include sustainability and climate change related developments, consumer protection measures and specific financial reforms andprivacy matters, which are discussed further below. For additional discussion of regulatory developments related to capital management and liquid ity\\nand funding risk, refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section and the Liquidity and Funding Risk section. For a discussion of the impact o f\\ncertain other regulatory developments, refer to: Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments – Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets; Risks That MayAffect Future Results – Fiscal and Monetary Policies and Other Economic Conditions in the Countries in which BMO Conducts Business; Tax Legislationand Interpretations; and Other Regulatory Developments.\\nSustainability and Climate Change Matters\\nWe continue to monitor the rulemaking activities of regulatory authorities, and we are participating in programs and consultations that focus on ris k\\nmanagement and disclosures related to sustainability matters, as well as trends in climate-related litigation. Globally, we are also tracking theemergence and finalization of formal supervisory regulatory frameworks governing the analysis and reporting of risks related to sustainability an d\\nclimate change, including frameworks in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. In addition, current and emergingregulatory requirements in certain U.S. states may apply restrictions or sanctions on financial institutions that impose any environmental standa rds\\nthat exceed the legal or regulatory requirements of the states in which they operate.

In Canada, there is continuing focus on requiring financial institutions to support mortgage holders at risk, asoutlined in the federal government’s Canadian Mortgage Charter. In addition, the government is taking steps to reduce the costs of banking, includin g\\nby lowering banking fees, through a cap on non-sufficient funds fees, which will reduce our fee revenue when implemented. Several provinces arealso enhancing protections for consumers, including such areas as consumer fraud, through legislative changes to their consumer protection regime s.\\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators adopted changes to harmonize and enhance reporting of theongoing costs, including embedded fees, of owning investment funds and segregated funds. In the United States, banking regulators have aheightened focus on matters pertaining to racial equity, financial inclusion and consumer protection, including the impact on consumers from fraud or\\nprocesses to protect consumers from fraud. Key consumer concerns, including fair lending and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices, are nowsubject to heightened regulatory scrutiny in bank examination programs. In both Canada and the United States, there is a growing focus on consumerdata rights and both jurisdictions have started to introduce regulatory frameworks for open banking that will require banks to share data, aspermitted by consumers, with authorized third parties.\\nPrivacy\\nProtection of personal information is critical to maintaining the trust of our customers. Our handling of personal information is increasingly impo rtant\\nas we continue to drive our Digital First strategy. There is a growing focus on regulation related to privacy and the use and safeguarding of personalinformation, and we continue to advance our privacy program to comply with new and amended legislation where we do business. In Canada,significant reform to federal privacy laws is expected under Bill C-27, including new regulatory powers and penalties and additional legislation toaddress the use of artificial intelligence. In Quebec, Law 25 (previously Bill 64) came into effect in three phases, beginning in fiscal 2021 and endin g\\nin September 2024. Law 25 modernizes the province’s private-sector privacy regime, introduces new regulations related to biometrics and automateddecisions, and gives new powers to regulators to impose monetary administrative penalties. Outside of Canada, large fines and settlements havebeen imposed for breaches of privacy rights and failure to comply with regulatory privacy requirements – evidence of heightened regulatory vigilanc e\\nand enforcement. The California Consumer Privacy Act was enhanced and amended in 2023 by the California Privacy Rights Act , which includes new\\nand expanded privacy rights for California residents. Other states have introduced privacy legislation, which is leading to a growing patchwork ofprivacy laws in the United States. In the European Union and the United Kingdom, there are ongoing concerns regarding the transfer of personal datato countries lacking adequate privacy protection. Privacy-related risks, including risks of privacy breaches, have escalated as a result of the thr eat\\nlandscape. For further discussion, refer to the Top and Emerging Risks That May Affect Future Results – Cyber and Information Security Risk section an d\\nthe Operational Non-Financial Risk – Cyber and Information Security Risk section.\\nU.S. Regulatory Developments\\nThere are several pending regulatory rules that will likely impact BMO’s U.S. operations, including the following:\\n‰Capital: In July 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued new rule proposals that would revise the regulatory capital framework for large bank holdingcompanies and their depository institutions, including BMO Financial Corp. (BFC), BMO’s U.S. holding company, and BMO Bank N.A. These proposalswould implement the risk-based capital standards contained in the Basel III Reforms (referred to as Basel III Endgame) published by the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision. On September 10, 2024, the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the proposed rules will be revised andre-issued as a new proposal.\\n‰Long-term debt: In August 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a new rule proposal that would require large banks with total assetsof $100 billion or more to maintain a layer of long-term debt, which would improve financial stability by increasing the resolvability and resilienceof such institutions.\\nThe impact of these proposed rules on our results will depend on the final rules issued by the U.S. banking agencies. We currently do not expect a\\nmaterial change to our enterprise-level funding activities if these rules are enacted as proposed.\\nBFC is regulated as a Category III firm under the Enhanced Prudential Standards issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Additional information\\nregarding regulatory requirements that apply to BFC is set out in the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section.\\nCautionThis Legal and Regulatory Risk section contains forward-looking statements.

The impact of this risk can be limited through an effective strategic risk management framework and stress testing.\\nBMO’s Corporate Strategy group oversees the strategic planning process and works with the lines of business and Corporate Services to identify,\\nmonitor and mitigate risks across the enterprise. Our rigorous strategic risk management framework encourages a consistent approach in thedevelopment of strategic plans through an integrated, multi-year strategic and financial planning process, in alignment with our enterprise riskappetite.\\nThe framework promotes consistency and adherence to management standards, including a consideration of the results of stress testing as an\\ninput into our decision-making. The potential impacts of changes in the business environment, including macroeconomic developments, broadindustry trends, the actions of existing and new competitors and regulatory developments, are considered in this process and inform decision-makin g\\nwithin each line of business. Oversight of strategic risk is the responsibility of the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. This is carried out\\nthrough an annual review of enterprise and operating group strategies, which involves interactive sessions that challenge assumptions and thestrategies in the context of both the current and potential future business environment. Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management reviews businessstrategies to confirm that they are developed and executed in accordance with the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework and are within ourestablished risk appetite, tolerances and limits. Where required, these strategies are revised to address new or unexpected developments.\\nStrategic risk also includes business risk arising from specific enterprise activities and the effects these could have on earnings. Within BMO, eac h\\noperating group is responsible for controlling its respective business risk by assessing, managing and mitigating risks. To manage exposure totransverse business risks (i.e., those spanning multiple lines of business, such as climate change), the Corporate Strategy group works in tandem wi th\\nthe relevant business partners to shape effective mitigation approaches.\\nOur ability to implement the strategic plans developed by management influences our financial performance. Performance objectives are\\nestablished through the strategic planning process and our progress toward those objectives is monitored regularly and reported on quarterly, usin g\\nboth leading and lagging indicators of absolute and relative performance, so that strategies can be reviewed and adjusted where necessary. Regularstrategic and financial updates are also reviewed closely in order to identify any significant emerging risk issues.\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk\\nEnvironmental and Social Risk is the potential for loss or harm directly or indirectly resulting from environmental and social factors that impact\\nBMO or its customers, and BMO’s impact on the environment and society.\\nIn recognition of its unique characteristics, environmental and social (E&S) risk is classified in BMO’s Risk Taxonomy as a transverse risk that may\\nmanifest itself through other risk types, namely credit and counterparty risk, market risk, insurance risk, liquidity and funding risk, operationa l\\nnon-financial risk, legal and regulatory risk, strategic risk and reputation risk. E&S risk may arise over a range of time frames, from short-term tolong-term. Factors that may give rise to E&S risk include, but are not limited to: climate change; pollution and waste; the use of energy, water andother resources; biodiversity and land use; human rights; diversity, equity and inclusion; labour standards; community health, safety and securit y; land\\nacquisition and involuntary resettlement; Indigenous peoples’ rights; and cultural heritage. We are advancing our risk identification efforts by defining\\nthese factors and identifying any risk exposures that may be affected by the transverse impact of these factors.\\nWe recognize that climate change involves exposure to physical and transition risks. Physical risks are associated with a changing climate, which\\ncan have both acute and chronic physical effects. These risks may include an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather-related events, suchas storms, floods, wildfires and heatwaves, or longer-term changes, such as temperature changes, rising sea levels and changes in soil productivity .\\nTo date, key climate change indicators, weather-related events and associated scientific research indicate that global exposure to climate change risks\\nappears to be accelerating. Transition risks are associated with the shift to a net zero carbon economy. These risks may arise from climate-relatedpolicy changes, technological changes and behavioural changes involving carbon-pricing mechanisms, or a shift in consumer preferences towardlower-carbon products and services. We continue to closely monitor these changes, some of which may unfold more rapidly than others asconsumers, clients, investors, governments and communities act to enhance their resilience to climate-related risks.\\nWe may have direct exposure to E&S risk associated with the ownership and operation of BMO’s businesses. We may be indirectly exposed to the\\nrisk of financial loss or reputational harm if our customers or suppliers are affected by E&S factors or are associated with adverse environmental orsocial impacts to such an extent that they are unable to meet their financial or other obligations to us, or cause reputational risks for BMO. E&S factor s\\nmay also give rise to the risk of reputational harm if we are perceived to not respond effectively to those factors, or to cause, contribute or be linkedto adverse impacts on the environment or society, as discussed in the Reputation Risk section.\\nGovernance\\nThe Board of Directors, through the Risk Review Committee (RRC), approves the E&S Risk Appetite Statement and the E&S Risk Corporate Policy, asdiscussed below. The RRC assists the Board of Directors in meeting its oversight responsibilities for the identification, assessment and managemen to f\\nour exposure to E&S risk, including risks arising from climate change, for the overall adherence to risk management corporate policies, and forcomplying with risk-related regulatory requirements. The Audit and Conduct Review Committee (ACRC) assesses the effectiveness of BMO’sgovernance of sustainability matters and approves BMO’s sustainability reporting and disclosures, including our Sustainability Report and Publi c\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 107\\n\\n\\n## Page 96\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAccountability Statement, and our Climate Report. The Human Resources Committee has responsibility for the alignment of executive compensation\\nwith performance, including performance in relation to BMO’s environmental and social objectives. The Governance and Nominating Committeeregularly reviews the charters of our Board of Directors and its committees to assess the coverage and alignment of their responsibilities foroverseeing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues with their respective mandates.\\nBMO’s General Counsel is the bank’s Executive Committee Sponsor for Sustainability and Climate, and has accountability for legal and regulatory\\nrisk, reputation risk, business conduct and ethics, and sustainability, including climate change. Our ESG Executive Committee comprises executiv e\\ncommittee members from the lines of business and Corporate Services, and provides oversight and leadership for our sustainability strategy,including our Climate Ambition. In addition to the ESG Executive Committee, BMO has a Sustainability Council which acts as a leadership forum foradvancing sustainability initiatives. Senior management oversees E&S risk through management committees and forums that provide oversight andreceive updates on sustainability matters and E&S risk. These include, but are not limited to: Disclosure Committee, Risk Management Committee(RMC), Reputation Risk Management Committee (RRMC), Enterprise Regulatory Committee, Climate Commercialization Working Group and ImpactInvestment Fund Committee, as well as the Investment Committee of BMO Global Asset Management. Additional committees, forums and workinggroups may be established as needed. In addition, the Board of Directors and any management committees active in other jurisdictions receiveupdates and oversee E&S risk for the relevant jurisdiction. They also receive updates on sustainability matters and E&S risk across the enterprise.\\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO), as Head of Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management (ERPM), and supported by the Risk Executive Committee, acts\\nas the second line of defence on the transverse impacts of E&S risk on credit and counterparty risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, insurancerisk and operational non-financial risk; oversees risk appetite for E&S risk in the context of these risks; and reports to the Board of Directors, its R RC\\nand the RMC on E&S risk.\\nStrategy\\nOur climate ambition is to be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world. This ambition is explicitly linked to our enterprisecommercial strategy, and we are working to realize this ambition through a four-pillar climate strategy: Commitment; Capabilities; Client partner ship\\nand commercialization; and Convening for climate action. Our strategy seeks to capture commercialization opportunities by working with our client s\\non their decarbonization journeys. The strategy is being implemented by our operating groups, overseen by the ESG Executive Committee andsupported by the BMO Climate Institute, which serves as an enterprise resource to accelerate BMO’s climate-related transition efforts and as aninternal and external convenor on climate action.\\nIn order to remain informed about emerging E&S risks, we participate in global forums with other financial institutions and maintain an open\\ndialogue with other external parties.\\nE&S Risk Management\\nA successful future for BMO and our customers depends on the sustainability of the environment, communities and economies in which we operate.We seek to understand the impact that E&S risk factors could have on our business environment, as well as on our clients, portfolios and operations.With this understanding, we are better positioned to make informed strategic decisions.\\nOur E&S Risk Corporate Policy, applicable to all BMO employees, sets out our approach to integrating E&S risk into the Enterprise-Wide Risk\\nManagement Framework (ERMF). The policy affirms the expectation of our Board of Directors that BMO will integrate considerations of E&S risk acrossthe ERMF, including risks arising from climate change. It is supported by BMO’s three-lines-of-defence operating model and is underpinned by our ris k\\nculture. Its implementation involves building new capabilities, while also leveraging our existing risk governance provisions and resources, to i dentify,\\nassess, manage, monitor and report on potential impacts on our clients, portfolios and operations. The E&S Risk Corporate Policy is complemented bytwo enterprise-wide policy documents: a Climate Risk Corporate Standard to enable effective climate risk management and support legal andregulatory compliance, and an E&S Risk Management Framework Directive, which supports implementation of the corporate policy.\\nWe have developed a qualitative Risk Appetite Statement that includes E&S risks, including risks related to climate change. In addition, we have\\nenhanced a transition key risk metric with risk tolerance thresholds, which measures our credit risk exposure in support of carbon-related assets as a\\npercentage of our total credit risk exposure. In parallel, we have also included a key risk indicator to quantify BMO’s exposure to physical risks offlooding, and will continue to expand and enhance these key risk metrics and indicators as appropriate to monitor climate risk concentrations.\\nE&S risk is also addressed in our Credit Risk Management Framework, including provisions for governance and accountabilities, enhanced due\\ndiligence and thresholds for escalations or exceptions. Sector-specific financing guidelines help us identify and manage exposure to E&S risk in hi gher-\\nrisk sectors and integrate consideration of these risks into our decision-making, which also considers factors such as climate change and Indigenou s\\nconsultation. The E&S Risk General Financing Guideline is an enterprise-level second-line directive that applies to wholesale lending transactio ns;\\narticulates our lending risk appetite for E&S risk, outlines the enhanced due diligence process, supported by E&S Risk Rating (ESRR) assessment tool s\\ndeveloped to address sectors with heightened risk and outlines lending considerations, escalations and elevations. The E&S Risk General FinancingGuideline includes direction on developing an understanding of the specific impacts of climate change on borrowers and their operations, includingregulatory and/or legislative changes.\\nWe maintain a diversified lending portfolio to limit our exposure to any one sector or geographic region that might be vulnerable to climate-\\nrelated risk, and we continue to conduct sector-specific reviews across our lending portfolio to assess exposure to climate-sensitive industries. Social\\nand environmental requirements in financing arrangements and transactions are monitored by the lines of business as part of our overall monitoringprocess. Transactions involving significant environmental or social concerns may be escalated to the RRMC for consideration.\\nWe are continuing to develop our climate scenario analysis program to explore climate-specific vulnerabilities and enhance our resilience to\\nclimate-related risks, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The climate scenario an alysis\\nprogram leverages existing risk capabilities in combination with climate-specific expertise, tools and data. This program includes the evaluatio no f\\ntransition risks and physical risks through comprehensive climate-based scenarios across portfolios and risk types, and also considers integrati on of\\nscenario impacts at the enterprise level. This capability enables the bank to execute on regulatory scenario analysis, such as the Standardized Clim ate\\n108 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 97\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Scenario Exercise from OSFI. These analyses help to identify potential exposures and concentrations to short-, medium- and long-term climate risks\\nand may inform our business strategy in relation to climate change going forward. For example, we have identified the channels through whichclimate risk manifests itself in credit, market, operational, liquidity and insurance risk. In addition, we have developed an integrated loss asses sment\\napproach for incorporating climate risk within the bank’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\\nWe continue to assess the credibility, reliability, comparability and decision-making usefulness of various measurement, assessment and\\nreporting approaches, as well as the ways in which we could incorporate them into our climate risk management program and associated disclosures.\\nManaging E&S Risk in the Supply Chain\\nOur Sustainability group partners with the Procurement and Corporate Real Estate groups on operational sustainability. Together, these groups areresponsible for establishing and maintaining an operational environmental management approach, including the application of the framework set ou t\\nin ISO 14001 across our essential facilities, and for setting objectives and targets that are intended to align our operations with our sustainabilit y\\nperformance goals.\\nBMO’s Code of Conduct has been approved by our Board of Directors, and reflects our commitment to manage our business responsibly. We\\nreport publicly under the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 2015 , the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 and Canada’s Fighting Against Forced\\nLabour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act , and we have in place a Supplier Code of Conduct which outlines our standards for integrity, fair dealing\\nand sustainability. We require our suppliers to be aware of, understand and comply with the principles of our Supplier Code of Conduct.\\nBMO’s disclosures will be updated to meet any evolution in the expectations of pertinent legislation, in accordance with applicable timelines.\\nRegulatory Developments\\nE&S-related regulations, frameworks and guidance are rapidly evolving and we continue to monitor such developments, updating our riskmanagement practices and disclosures as necessary.\\nIn March 2024, OSFI released updates to Guideline B-15, Climate Risk Management to align with the International Sustainability Standards\\nBoard’s final IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures , standard. We incorporated these updates into our implementation plans for the first set of\\ndisclosures, effective the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, to be made publicly available no later than 180 days after the fiscal year-end, as well a s\\nthe second phase of disclosure requirements that will be effective the fiscal year ending October 31, 2025.\\nWe are also assessing the impact of the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires disclosure across\\nvarious sustainability topics, as detailed in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards.\\nMetrics and Targets\\nOur reporting on climate-related metrics and targets includes a discussion of BMO’s Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, calculated usingthe GHG Protocol, and a discussion of our Scope 3 emissions, calculated using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). More detaileddiscussion, as well as a discussion of financed emissions targets for certain sectors, can be found in the Climate Report. The BMO Sustainability Repo rt\\nand Climate Report contain metrics, including the tracking of sustainable finance, which are relevant for sustainability purposes but may not bedirectly related to net zero goals or emissions reductions outcomes. The shareholders’ auditors provide a limited assurance report on selectedenvironmental and social indicators in the Sustainability Report and Climate Report.\\nCautionThis Environmental and Social Risk section contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statement s.\\nReputation Risk\\nReputation Risk is the potential for loss or harm to the BMO brand. It can arise even if other risks are managed effectively.\\nOur reputation is built on our commitment to high standards of business conduct and is one of our most valuable assets. By protecting and\\nmaintaining our reputation, we safeguard our brand, increase shareholder value, reduce our cost of capital, improve employee engagement andpreserve our customers’ loyalty and trust.\\nWe manage risks to our reputation by considering the potential reputational impact of all business activities, including strategy development and\\nimplementation, transactions and initiatives, data and technology use (including artificial intelligence), product and service offerings, and e vents or\\nincidents impacting BMO, as well as day-to-day decision-making and conduct. We consider our reputation in everything that we do.\\nBMO’s Code of Conduct is the foundation of our ethical culture, and it provides employees with guidance on the behaviour that is expected of\\nthem, so that they can make the right choice when making a decision. Ongoing reinforcement of the commitments set out in the Code of Conductminimizes risks to our reputation that may result from inappropriate behaviour or poor decision-making. Recognizing that non-financial risks can h ave\\na negative impact as significant as the effect of financial risks, we actively promote a culture in which employees are encouraged to raise concernsand are supported in doing so, with zero tolerance for retaliation.\\nIn our corporate governance practices and Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Framework, we have specific controls in place to manage risks to\\nour reputation. We seek to identify activities or events that could impact our reputation with customers, regulators or other interested parties. Wh ere\\nwe identify a potential risk to our reputation, we take steps to assess and manage that risk. Instances of significant or heightened exposure toreputation risk are escalated to BMO’s Reputation Risk Management Committee (RRMC) for review. As misconduct can impact our reputation, theChief Ethics Officer, who is responsible for enterprise-wide reporting on employee conduct, may escalate instances of misconduct involving signif icant\\nreputation risk to BMO’s RRMC for review, as appropriate.\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 109\\n\\n\\n## Page 98\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nAccounting Matters and Disclosure and Internal Control\\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\\nThe most significant assets and liabilities for which we must make estimates and judgments include: allowance for credit losses; financial instrume nts\\nmeasured at fair value; pension and other employee future benefits; impairment of securities and investments in associates and joint ventures;income taxes and deferred tax assets; goodwill and intangible assets; insurance contract liabilities; provisions, including legal proceedings an d\\nrestructuring charges; transfers of financial assets; consolidation of structured entities (SEs); and valuation of the Bank of the West assets acqu ired and\\nliabilities assumed. We make judgments in assessing the business model for financial assets, as well as whether substantially all risks and rewardshave been transferred in respect of transfers of financial assets and whether we control structured entities. These judgments are discussed in Notes 6\\nand 7 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements. Note 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements provides furtherdetails on the estimates and judgments made in determining the fair value of financial instruments. If actual results were to differ from theseestimates, the impact would be recorded in future periods.\\nBy their nature, the judgments and estimates that we make for the purposes of preparing financial statements relate to matters that are\\ninherently uncertain. However, we have detailed policies and control procedures in place that are intended to ensure the judgments made inestimating these amounts are well-controlled, independently reviewed and consistently applied from period to period. We believe that the estimate s\\nof the values of our assets and liabilities are appropriate.\\nFor a more detailed discussion of the use of estimates, refer to Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nAllowance for Credit Losses\\nThe allowance for credit losses primarily consists of allowances for impaired loans and allowances for performing loans. Our approach to establishi ng\\nand maintaining the allowance on performing loans is based on the requirements of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), and considering the\\nguideline issued by OSFI. Under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) methodology, an allowance is recorded for expected credit losses on financialassets, regardless of whether there has been an actual loss event. In particular, the ECL requirements of IFRS 9 incorporate the following elementsthat are subject to a high level of judgment: measuring 12-month and lifetime credit losses; determining when a significant increase in credit risk ha s\\noccurred; forecasting forward-looking information for multiple scenarios and determining the probability weighting of each scenario; and applic ation\\nof experienced credit judgment.\\nECL is calculated on a probability-weighted basis, based on four economic scenarios, and is calculated for each exposure in the portfolio as a\\nfunction of the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD), with the timing of the loss also considered. Wherethere has been a significant increase in credit risk, lifetime ECL is recorded; otherwise, 12 months of ECL is generally recorded. The determination o fa\\nsignificant increase in credit risk requires consideration of many different factors that will vary by product and risk segment. The main factorsconsidered in making this determination are the change in PD since origination and certain other criteria, such as 30-day past due and watchliststatus. We may apply experienced credit judgment to reflect factors not captured in the results produced by the ECL models, as we deem necessary.We apply experienced credit judgment to reflect the impact of the uncertain environment on credit conditions and the economy. We have controlsand processes in place to govern the ECL process, including judgments and assumptions used in determining the allowance on performing loans.These judgments and assumptions will change over time, and the impact of any such change will be recorded in future periods.\\nIn establishing our allowance on performing loans, we attach probability weightings to economic scenarios, which are representative of our view\\nof economic and market conditions. In fiscal 2024, we added a fourth scenario to reflect a less severe downside, allowing us to expand the range ofeconomic forecasts used in the allowance estimation. The base scenario represents our view of the most probable outcome, as well as upside,downside and severe downside scenarios, and are all developed by our Economics group.\\nThe allowance on performing loans is sensitive to changes in economic forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each forecast scenario.\\nWhen changes in economic performance in the forecasts are measured, we use real GDP as the basis, which acts as the key driver for movements inmany of the other economic and market variables used, including the equity volatility index (VIX), corporate BBB credit spreads, unemployment rates ,\\nhousing price indices and consumer credit. We also consider industry-specific variables, where applicable. Many of the variables have a high degree of\\ninterdependency, and as such, there is no single factor to which the allowances as a whole are sensitive. Holding all else constant, as economicvariables worsen, the allowance on performing loans would increase and conversely, as they improve, the allowance would decrease. In addition,assuming all variables are held constant, an increase in loan balances or a deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio would each drive a n\\nincrease in the allowance on performing loans.\\nInformation on the provision for credit losses for the years ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 can be found in the Total Provision for Credit Losses\\nsection. Additional information on the process and methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses can be found in the discussion ofCredit and Counterparty Risk, as well as in Note 4 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value\\nWe record assets and liabilities classified as held for trading, assets and liabilities designated at fair value, derivatives, certain equity and de bt\\nsecurities and securities sold but not yet purchased at fair value. Fair value represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset orpaid on the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between willing parties at the measurement date. We employ a fair value hierarchy basedon inputs we use in valuation techniques to measure the fair value of our financial instruments. The extent of our use of quoted market prices(Level 1), internal models with observable market information (Level 2) and internal models without observable market information (Level 3) in thevaluation of loans, securities, derivatives, certain other assets and liabilities recorded at fair value as at October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 i s\\n110 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 99', 'metadata': {'source': 'rebuild_from_originals', 'file_type': 'PDF', 'file_name': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'chunk_index': 13, 'uploaded_by_session': 'rebuild_session', 'upload_timestamp': '2025-08-04T16:55:14.667380', 'file_size': 1920988, 'original_path': 'processed_files/20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf', 'display_name': 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, 'source_document': '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'}, {'page_content': '## Page 99\\n\\n                          MD&A                          disclosed in Note 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.

It meets at least monthly to address the more challenging valuation issues related to\\nour portfolios, approves valuation methodology changes as needed to enhance the reliability of our fair value estimates, and is a key forum for thediscussion of sources of valuation uncertainty and how these have been addressed by management. Certain financial instruments, including corporat e\\nequities, are valued by the respective business groups. Senior management oversees our valuation processes through various valuation and riskcommittees.\\nAs at October 31, 2024, total valuation adjustments were a net decrease in value of $268 million for financial instruments carried at fair value on\\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet (net decrease of $135 million as at October 31, 2023).\\nPension and Other Employee Future Benefits\\nOur pension and other employee future benefits expense is calculated by independent actuaries using assumptions determined by management.Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used are recognized in other comprehensive income.\\nPension and other employee future benefits expense, plan assets and defined benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in discount rates. We\\ndetermine discount rates at each year-end for all plans, using high-quality corporate bonds with terms matching the plans’ specific cash flows.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for pension and other employee future benefits, including a sensitivity analysis for key assumptions ,\\nis included in Note 22 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nImpairment of Securities and Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\\nDebt securities measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are assessed for impairment using theexpected credit loss model. For securities determined to have low credit risk, the allowance for credit losses is measured with an amount equalto 12-month expected credit loss.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for debt securities measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, other securities, the related allowance for\\ncredit losses and the determination of fair value is included in Notes 3 and 18 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nWe review our investments in associates and joint ventures, included within other assets, at each quarter-end reporting period in order to\\nidentify and evaluate any investments that show indications of possible impairment. For these investments, a significant or prolonged decline in fa ir\\nvalue to an amount below cost is objective evidence of impairment.\\nIncome Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\\nOur approach to tax matters is guided by our Statement on Tax Principles, elements of which are described below, and governed by our tax riskmanagement framework, which is implemented through internal controls and processes. We operate with due regard to risks, including tax andreputation risks. We actively seek to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report any tax risks that may arise in order to understand our financialexposure to those risks. Our intention is to comply fully with tax laws. We consider all applicable laws in connection with our commercial activities,and where tax laws change in our business or for our customers, we adapt and make adjustments accordingly. We monitor applicable tax-relateddevelopments, including legislative proposals, case law and guidance from tax authorities. When an interpretation or application of tax laws is notclear, we take well-reasoned positions based on available case law and administrative positions of tax authorities, and we engage external advisorswhen necessary. We do not engage in tax planning that does not have commercial substance, and we do not knowingly work with customers webelieve use tax strategies to evade taxes. We are committed to maintaining productive relationships and cooperating with tax authorities on all taxmatters. We seek to resolve disputes in a collaborative manner; however, when our interpretation of tax law differs from that of tax authorities, weare prepared to defend our position.\\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in either the Consolidated Statement\\nof Income, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. In determining the provisionfor income taxes, we interpret tax legislation, case law and administrative positions in numerous jurisdictions and, based on our judgment, we recor d\\nthe estimate of the amount required to settle tax obligations. We also make assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred taxassets and liabilities. If the interpretations and assumptions differ from those of tax authorities or if the timing of reversals is not as expected, t he\\nprovision for income taxes could increase or decrease in future periods. The amount of any such increase or decrease cannot be reasonably estimated.\\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against which\\ndeductible temporary differences or unused tax losses and tax credits may be utilized. We are required to assess whether it is probable that deferredincome tax assets will be realized. Factors used to assess the probability of realization are past experience of income and capital gains, forecasts o f\\nfuture net income before taxes, and the remaining expiration period of tax loss carryforwards and tax credits. Changes in our assessment of thesefactors could increase or decrease the provision for income taxes in future periods.\\nCanadian tax authorities have reassessed us for additional income tax and interest in an amount of approximately $1,465 million in respect of\\ncertain 2011-2018 Canadian corporate dividends. These reassessments denied certain dividend deductions on the basis that the dividends were\\nBMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024 111\\n\\n\\n## Page 100\\n\\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\nreceived as part of a “dividend rental arrangement”. In general, the tax rules raised by Canadian tax authorities were prospectively addressed in\\nthe 2015 and 2018 Canadian federal budgets. We filed Notices of Appeal with the Tax Court of Canada and the matter is in litigation. We remain ofthe view that our tax filing positions were appropriate and intend to challenge all reassessments. However, if such challenges are unsuccessful, theadditional expense would negatively impact net income.\\nAdditional information regarding accounting for income taxes is included in Note 23 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually. This assessment includes a comparison of the carrying value and the recoverable amount ofeach of our cash-generating units (CGUs) in order to verify that the recoverable amount of each CGU is greater than its carrying value. If the carryingvalue of a CGU were to exceed its recoverable amount, an impairment calculation would be performed. The recoverable amount of a CGU is thehigher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\\nFair value less costs to sell has been used to perform the impairment test in all periods. In determining fair value less costs to sell, we employ a\\ndiscounted cash flow model, consistent with that used when a business is acquired. This model is dependent on assumptions related to revenuegrowth, discount rates, synergies achieved on acquisition and the availability of comparable acquisition data. Changes in any of these assumptionswould affect the determination of fair value for each of our CGUs in a different manner. Management must exercise judgment and make assumptionsin determining fair value. Differences in judgments and assumptions could affect the determination of fair value and any resulting impairmentwrite-down.\\nAs at October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, no goodwill impairment was recorded, as the estimated fair value of the CGUs was greater than\\ntheir carrying value.\\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized to income on either a straight-line or an accelerated basis over a period not exceeding\\n15 years, depending on the nature of the asset. We test intangible assets with definite lives for impairment when circumstances indicate thatthe carrying value may not be recoverable.\\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment. If an intangible asset is determined to be impaired, it will be written\\ndown to its recoverable amount, the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell, when this is less than the carrying value.\\nAdditional information regarding the composition of goodwill and intangible assets is included in Note 11 of the audited annual consolidated\\nfinancial statements.\\nInsurance Contract Liabilities\\nInsurance contract liabilities represent estimates of fulfillment cash flows, which include a risk adjustment, and the contractual service margin (CSM).\\nFulfillment cash flows include estimates of future cash flows related to the remaining coverage period and for previously incurred claims, which arethen discounted and probability weighted. This is based on non-financial risk assumptions including mortality, policy lapses and expenses, which a re\\nbased on a combination of industry and entity specific data, and in the case of expenses, on historical analysis of which expenses are attributable toinsurance operations. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated to reflect actual experience and market conditions. In addition ,\\nwe add a risk adjustment for non-financial risk to bring the confidence level on the sufficiency of reserves to 70%-80%. The CSM is a component ofthe liability representing the unearned profit we recognize as we provide services.\\nAdditional information on insurance contract liabilities is provided in Note 15 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements, and\\ninformation on insurance risk is provided in the Insurance Risk section and the Insurance Market Risk section.\\nProvisions\\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, we have a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it isprobable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are recorded at the best estimate of the amountrequired to settle any obligation as at the balance sheet date, considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. For example, BMOand its subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions in the normal course of business. Factors considered in estimating any obligation related to\\nthese legal actions include a case-by-case assessment of specific facts and circumstances, past experience and the opinions of legal experts.Management and internal and external experts are involved in estimating any amounts that may be required. Certain provisions also relate torestructuring initiatives that we have undertaken. These provisions are recorded at management’s best estimate of the amounts that will ultimatelybe paid out.\\nThe actual costs of settling some obligations may be substantially higher or lower than the amount of the provisions.Additional information regarding provisions is included in the Legal and Regulatory Risk section and in Note 25 of the audited annual\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\nTransfers of Financial Assets\\nWe sell Canadian residential and commercial mortgages to third-party Canadian securitization programs, including the Canada Mortgage BondProgram, and directly to third-party investors under the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities program.\\nWe also purchase or originate certain commercial mortgage loans that are subsequently sold and derecognized, and we purchase U.S.\\ngovernment agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) issued by third-party sponsored vehicles, which we may further securitize byrepackaging them into new CMOs prior to selling to third-party investors.\\nWe assess whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of, or control over, the assets have been transferred in order to determine if they\\nqualify for derecognition. Where we continue to be exposed to substantially all of the prepayment, interest rate and/or credit risk associated with t he\\nsecuritized assets, they do not qualify for derecognition. We continue to recognize these financial instruments, and recognize the related cashproceeds as a secured financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n112 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 101\\n\\n                          MD&A                          Consolidation of Structured Entities\\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into arrangements with SEs as described in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section. We are required\\nto consolidate a SE if we control the SE. We control a SE when we have power over the SE, exposure or rights to variable returns as a result of ourinvolvement, and the ability to exercise power to affect the amount of those returns. For certain SEs, we exercise judgment in determining whetherwe control the entity.\\nAdditional information concerning our interests in SEs is included in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section, as well as in Note 7 of the\\naudited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition of Bank of the West – Valuation of Assets and Liabilities\\nSignificant judgments and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of the Bank of the West assets acquired and liabilities assumed,including the loan portfolio, core deposit and other relationship intangible assets and fixed-maturity deposits.\\nAdditional information regarding the accounting for this acquisition is included in Notes 4 and 10 of the audited annual consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\nCautionThis Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section contains forward-looking statements.

Upon transition to IFRS 17, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for the\\nmeasurement of investment properties, included in insurance-related assets in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, from cost to fairvalue. These changes were applied retrospectively to our fiscal 2023 results.\\nFurther details can be found in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nIFRS 9, Financial Instruments\\nEffective November 1, 2023, we voluntarily changed our accounting policy to account for regular way contracts to buy or sell financial assets on the\\ntrade date, instead of on the settlement date, and applied this change retrospectively.\\nIAS 12, Income Taxes\\nEffective November 1, 2023, we adopted an amendment to IAS 12, Income Taxes (IAS 12), which narrows the IAS 12 exemption to exclude\\ntransactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.\\nFurther details can be found in Note 1 of the audited annual consolidated financial statements.\\nFuture Changes in Accounting Policies\\nIFRS 9, Financial Instruments\\nIn May 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued amendments to IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), which introduce\\nadditional guidance in two areas. The first relates to financial assets with contingent features and when these features can be considered consisten t\\nwith a basic lending arrangement, in which case the instrument can be measured at amortized cost. The second relates to the timing of derecognitionof financial liabilities when payment takes place through an electronic payment system and certain conditions are met. These amendments will beeffective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of these amendments on our consolidated financialstatements.\\nIAS 12, Income Taxes\\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 12. The amendment addresses concerns around accounting for the global minimum top-up tax, as\\noutlined in the two-pillar plan for international tax reform developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development/G20 Inclusiv e\\nFramework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. The amendment to IAS 12 includes temporary mandatory relief from recognizing and disclosingdeferred taxes related to the top-up tax. We have applied the temporary mandatory relief related to deferred taxes in jurisdictions in which weoperate where the top-up tax legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted. The global minimum tax rules will be effective for our fiscal yearbeginning November 1, 2024, and as a result, we expect an increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2025 of up to 65 basis points.\\nIFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\\nIn April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (IFRS 18), which will replace IAS 1, Presentation of\\nFinancial Statements , and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2027. IFRS 18 changes how information is grouped and\\npresented in the financial statements, and requires that certain management performance measures be included in the financial statements. We arecurrently assessing the impact of the standard on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\\nCautionThis Future Changes in Accounting Policies section contains forward-looking statements.

Beginning January 1, 2024, we no longer report this revenue related tocertain Canadian dividends on a taxable equivalent basis in BMO Capital Markets.\\nIn addition, the legislation included the Global Minimum Tax Act , which introduced a 15% global minimum tax on income earned by large\\nmultinational groups and will be effective for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2024, as noted in the Future Changes in Accounting Policies –IAS 12, Income Taxes section.\\nU.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Assessment\\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) approved the final rule to implement the special assessment on depository\\ninstitutions to recover the losses incurred in the deposit insurance fund that were attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors of Silico n\\nValley Bank and Signature Bank. BMO recorded a $357 million ($476 million pre-tax) charge related to the FDIC special assessment in fiscal 2024. Weexpect further refinements of the amount of the special assessment in subsequent periods as the FDIC has greater visibility of the final loss amounts.\\nInterbank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform\\nBMO has transitioned all exposure to Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) settings to alternative reference rates as at October 31, 2024.

The audit report states in its conclus ion\\nthat, in KPMG’s opinion, BMO maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at October 31, 2024, inaccordance with the criteria established in the 2013 COSO Framework.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended October 31, 2024 which materially affected, or arereasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n116 BMO Financial Group 207th Annual Report 2024                          MD&A                          \\n\\n\\n## Page 105\\n\\n         Supplemental Information         Supplemental Information\\nTen-Year Statistical Review\\nTABLE 64\\n($ millions)\\nAs at or for the year ended October 31 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015\\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet\\nAssetsCash and cash equivalents 65,098 77,934 87,466 93,261 57,408 48,803 42,142 32,599 31,653 40,295\\nInterest bearing deposits with banks 3,640 4,109 5,677 8,303 9,035 7,987 8,305 6,490 4,449 7,382\\nSecurities 396,880 320,084 272,551 232,849 234,260 189,438 180,935 163,198 149,985 130,918\\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements 110,907 115,662 113,194 107,382 111,878 104,004 85,051 75,047 66,646 68,066\\nLoans, net of allowances 678,016 656,665 551,814 458,262 447,420 426,984 384,172 358,507 357,518 321,531\\nOther 155,106 172,552 142,695 88,118 89,260 74,979 72,688 73,763 77,709 73,689\\nTotal assets 1,409,647 1,347,006 1,173,397 988,175 949,261 852,195 773,293 709,604 687,960 641,881\\nLiabilities\\nDeposits 982,440 910,879 776,547 685,631 659,034 568,143 520,928 479,792 470,281 438,169\\nOther 334,544 351,776 317,662 238,128 225,218 225,981 199,862 180,438 170,910 159,383\\nSubordinated debt 8,377 8,228 8,150 6,893 8,416 6,995 6,782 5,029 4,439 4,416\\nTotal liabilities 1,325,361 1,270,883 1,102,359 930,652 892,668 801,119 727,572 665,259 645,630 601,968\\nTotal equity 84,286 76,123 71,038 57,523 56,593 51,076 45,721 44,345 42,330 39,913\\nTotal liabilities and equity 1,409,647 1,347,006 1,173,397 988,175 949,261 852,195 773,293 709,604 687,960 641,881\\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Income\\nNet interest income 19,468 18,681 15,885 14,310 13,971 12,888 11,438 11,275 10,945 9,796\\nNon-interest revenue 13,327 10,578 17,825 12,876 11,215 12,595 11,467 10,832 10,015 9,593\\nTotal revenue 32,795 29,259 33,710 27,186 25,186 25,483 22,905 22,107 20,960 19,389\\nInsurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit\\nliabilities (CCPB)\\n(1) – – (683) 1,399 1,708 2,709 1,352 1,538 1,543 1,254\\nProvision for credit losses (PCL) 3,761 2,178 313 20 2,953 872 662 746 771 544\\nNon-interest expense 19,499 21,134 16,194 15,509 14,177 14,630 13,477 13,192 12,916 12,250\\nIncome before income taxes 9,535 5,947 17,886 10,258 6,348 7,272 7,414 6,631 5,730 5,341\\nProvision for income taxes 2,208 1,510 4,349 2,504 1,251 1,514 1,961 1,292 1,100 936\\nNet income 7,327 4,437 13,537 7,754 5,097 5,758 5,453 5,339 4,630 4,405\\nNet income available to common shareholders 6,932 4,094 13,306 7,510 4,850 5,547 5,269 5,153 4,471 4,253\\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\\nPreferred shares and other equity instruments 8,087 6,958 6,308 5,558 6,598 5,348 4,340 4,240 3,840 3,240\\nCommon shares 23,921 22,941 17,744 13,599 13,430 12,971 12,929 13,032 12,539 12,313\\nContributed surplus 354 328 317 313 302 303 300 307 294 299\\nRetained earnings 46,469 44,006 45,117 35,497 30,745 28,725 25,850 23,700 21,207 18,930\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 5,419 1,862 1,552 2,556 5,518 3,729 2,302 3,066 4,426 4,640\\nNon-controlling interest in subsidiaries 36 2 8 –––––– 2 4 4 9 1\\nTotal equity 84,286 76,123 71,038 57,523 56,593 51,076 45,721 44,345 42,330 39,913\\nBMO adopted various new and amended IFRS standards in 2015, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) in 2018 and IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16) in 2020 prospectively, with no changes to prior periods.
