It is a fundamental banking metric that measures a bank's core financial strength by comparing its core equity capital to its risk-weighted assets (RWA).\n\nThis ratio is particularly important because:\n- It serves as a key regulatory measure of a bank's financial stability\n- It helps assess a bank's ability to withstand financial stress\n- It's part of the broader regulatory capital framework, which includes both Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital\n\nUnder current banking regulations, banks must maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5% before applying the capital conservation buffer to be considered adequately capitalized.\n\nThis metric is one of the most important indicators used by regulators and investors to evaluate a bank's financial health and resilience during challenging economic conditions.",
