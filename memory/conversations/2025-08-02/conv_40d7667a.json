      "content": "Here's a comprehensive analysis of the key regulatory requirements across CAR documents:\n\nThe regulatory requirements primarily focus on seven critical areas, with special emphasis on Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) and overall financial system stability:\n\n1. Capital Requirements and Buffers\n- Mandatory 1% CET1 surcharge for D-SIBs\n- 2.5% capital conservation buffer requirement\n- Total target CET1 of 8% plus Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB)\n- Additional NVCC capital instruments (2-3%)\n\n2. Domestic Stability Buffer Framework\n- Range of 0% to 4.0% of Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)\n- Semi-annual review process\n- Applicable exclusively to D-SIBs\n- Functions as an additional capital requirement layer\n\n3. Enhanced Supervisory Requirements\n- Intensive supervision based on institution size and complexity\n- Regular stress testing protocols\n- International supervisory coordination\n- Continuous monitoring through on-site and off-site supervision\n- TLAC ratio monitoring and resolution planning\n\n4. Disclosure Requirements\n- Alignment with international peer disclosure practices\n- Implementation of FSB Enhanced Disclosure Task Force recommendations\n- Risk model transparency\n- Detailed risk management practice disclosure\n\n5. Risk Management Framework\n- Advanced methodologies for credit, market, and operational risks\n- Enhanced control expectations for key business lines\n- Comprehensive risk assessment framework\n- Regular stress testing requirements\n\n6. D-SIB Specific Requirements\n- Applies to six designated Canadian banks\n- Enhanced oversight functions and internal controls\n- Regular assessment of systemic importance\n- Specialized monitoring of payment systems participation\n\n7. International Alignment\n- Adoption of Basel Committee G-SIB framework\n- Surcharge range of 1% to 3.5% RWA\n- Coordination with international supervisory standards\n- Implementation of evolving global requirements\n\nThese requirements form a comprehensive framework designed to ensure the stability and resilience of the Canadian banking system, with particular focus on systemically important institutions. The framework emphasizes progressive supervision, robust capital buffers, and transparent risk management practices.\n\nNote: Individual institutions may face additional requirements based on their specific risk profiles and market positions beyond these baseline regulatory requirements.",

Here are the key components:\n\n1. Core Capital Requirements\n- Minimum CET1: 4.5%\n- Minimum Tier 1: 6.0%\n- Minimum Total Capital: 8.0%\n\n2. Enhanced Capital Buffers\na) Capital Conservation Buffer:\n- Additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWA)\n- Must be maintained using CET1 capital\n- Includes distribution restrictions when buffer is breached\n\nb) Countercyclical Buffer (CCyB):\n- Range: 0-2.5% of RWA\n- Based on geographic exposure to private sector credit\n- Requires 6-12 month notice for increases\n- Immediate implementation for decreases\n\n3. Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs)\n- Additional 1% CET1 surcharge\n- Enhanced supervisory oversight\n- Target ratios:\n  * CET1: 8.0% plus DSB\n  * Tier 1: 9.5% plus DSB\n  * Total Capital: 11.5% plus DSB\n\n4. Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB)\n- Applies exclusively to D-SIBs\n- Range: 0-4.0% of RWA\n- Semi-annual review\n- Must be met with CET1 capital\n\n5. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) Calculation\n- Based on credit, market, and operational risks\n- Includes counterparty credit risk\n- Considers central counterparty exposures\n- Incorporates credit valuation adjustment risk\n\n6. Model Approval Requirements\n- Explicit OSFI approval needed for:\n  * IRB approaches to credit risk\n  * Internal Model Method for counterparty risk\n  * Internal Models Approach for market risk\n\n7. Capital Floor Framework\n- Adjustment factor of 72.5% (phased in from 2023-2026)\n- Ensures minimum levels of capital across institutions\n- Gradual implementation schedule:\n  * 2023: 65%\n  * 2024: 67.5%\n  * 2025: 70%\n  * 2026+: 72.5%\n\n8. Supervisory Oversight\n- Enhanced supervision for D-SIBs includes:\n  * International supervisory colleges\n  * Coordinated supervision plans\n  * Regular stress testing\n  * Recovery and resolution planning\n  * Increased monitoring frequency\n\nThe framework emphasizes a multi-layered approach to capital adequacy, combining minimum requirements with various buffers and enhanced supervision for systemically important institutions. This structure aims to ensure institutional resilience while maintaining flexibility to address emerging systemic risks.\n\nInstitutions must integrate these requirements into their capital planning processes and maintain regular public disclosures of their capital positions, particularly regarding buffer levels and any changes to them.",
