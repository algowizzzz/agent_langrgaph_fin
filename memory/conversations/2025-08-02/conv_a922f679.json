Today we're going to learn about how banks keep our money safe, just like your piggy bank, but bigger! \n\nThink About Your Piggy Bank 🐷\nWhen you put money in your piggy bank, you're keeping it safe, right? Banks do the same thing, but they have special rules to follow to make sure everyone's money stays super safe!\n\nThe Big Bank Family 🏦\nThere are different kinds of banks:\n- Regular banks (like neighborhood banks)\n- Super important banks (we call them D-SIBs)\n- Special savings banks\n\nThe Safety Rules Game 🎮\nJust like you have rules at home and school, banks have rules too:\n1. They must save extra money (like having backup coins in your piggy bank)\n2. They need to be careful with everyone's money\n3. They have to tell grown-ups how they're doing\n4. They need to help other banks\n\nThe Special Savings Jars 🏺\nBanks need different savings jars (just like you might have different piggy banks):\n- One for everyday money\n- One for emergency money\n- One for special times\n- One for helping others\n\nThe Safety Numbers Game 123️⃣\nBanks need to keep certain amounts of money safe:\n- At least 7% in their first jar\n- At least 8.5% in their second jar\n- At least 10.5% in their total savings\n\nThe Helper Team 👥\nBanks have special helpers (like how you have teachers and parents):\n- Bank checkers who make sure everything is okay\n- Safety teams who watch the money\n- Special helpers for emergencies\n- Friends from other countries who share good ideas\n\nThe Emergency Plan 🚨\nJust like you know what to do if there's a fire drill, banks have emergency plans:\n- Extra savings for tough times\n- Special plans if something goes wrong\n- Ways to help other banks\n- Plans to keep everyone's money safe\n\nThe Sharing Rules 📢\nBanks need to tell everyone:\n- How much money they're saving\n- If they're following the rules\n- If they need help\n- How they're keeping money safe\n\nThe Getting Better Plan 📈\nBanks always try to get better by:\n- Learning new things\n- Making better plans\n- Using better tools\n- Helping more people\n\nThe Special Bank Club 🌟\nSome banks are extra important (like team captains). In Canada, there are six super important banks that need to:\n- Save even more money\n- Be extra careful\n- Help other banks\n- Follow more rules\n\nThe Safety Check List ✅\nBanks get checked on:\n- Their savings\n- Their plans\n- Their helpers\n- Their emergency ideas\n\nRemember! 🌈\nThe most important things to know are:\n1. Banks keep our money safe\n2. They follow lots of rules\n3. They have many helpers\n4. They always need to be careful\n5. They save extra money for emergencies\n\nJust like you keep your toys safe and follow rules at home, banks do the same thing with everyone's money! They're like giant piggy banks that work extra hard to protect all the savings inside! \n\nAnd that's how banks stay safe and strong! Isn't it amazing how they take care of everyone's money? 🏦✨\n\nThe End! Remember to keep your own piggy bank safe too! 🐷💰",

Let's pretend we're playing a special game with the biggest piggy banks in the world - banks! Just like you have rules when playing games, banks have special rules too.\n\nTHE SAFETY CUSHION STORY\n\nThink about when you jump on a trampoline - you need safety pads around it, right? Banks need safety cushions too! They're called \"capital requirements\" but let's just call them safety money.\n\nThere are three special safety cushions:\n1. The Basic Cushion\n- Like wearing your helmet when riding your bike\n- Every bank needs this to stay safe\n- It's their first protection\n\n2. The Extra Cushion\n- Like having spare batteries for your favorite toy\n- Helps when things get tough\n- Keeps everything working smoothly\n\n3. The Super Special Cushion\n- Like having an emergency flashlight at home\n- Changes size depending on what's happening\n- Helps during extra tricky times\n\nTHE SUPER IMPORTANT BANKS\n\nSome banks are extra special - like the biggest toy stores in your city! We call them \"D-SIBs\" (but you can think of them as Super Banks). In Canada, there are six Super Banks, and they need extra special care.\n\nTHE SAFETY CHECKLIST\n\nJust like you have a bedtime routine, banks have their own checklist:\n1. Keep lots of safety money ready\n2. Check their safety cushions regularly\n3. Follow special rules to protect everyone's money\n4. Have grown-ups check their work\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF A BANK NEEDS HELP?\n\nSometimes, just like when you need help tying your shoes, banks might need help too:\n- They get special warnings if something's not right\n- They make a plan to fix things\n- Special helpers make sure they're doing better\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS TO YOU\n\nAll these rules help keep your family's money safe:\n- Like having a super-secure treasure chest\n- Helps your parents buy things you need\n- Keeps your piggy bank money growing\n\nTHE FUN NUMBERS GAME\n\nBanks play a numbers game too:\n- They need at least 7% safety money (like having 7 cookies out of 100)\n- Some need even more (like having extra cookies just in case)\n- The bigger the bank, the more safety cookies they need!\n\nSPECIAL CHECKING TIME\n\nJust like your teacher checks your homework:\n- Special bank teachers check their work\n- They make sure banks follow all the rules\n- They give gold stars for doing things right\n\nREMEMBER THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS:\n\n1. Banks keep your money super safe\n2. They have lots of safety cushions\n3. Special helpers watch over them\n4. Everything works together like a big puzzle\n\nIt's just like having the world's biggest, safest piggy bank with lots of grown-ups making sure nothing goes wrong!\n\nAnd that's how banks stay safe and sound - just like your favorite teddy bear keeps you safe at night! \n\nIsn't it amazing how many people work together to keep everyone's money safe? It's like having a whole team of superheroes watching over your piggy bank!\n\nTHE END OF OUR BANK STORY! \n\nRemember: Just like you have rules to stay safe when playing, banks have rules to keep your family's money safe. And that's what makes banks so special!",

Target Capital Ratios:\nFor SMSBs:\n- CET1: 7.0%\n- Tier 1: 8.5%\n- Total Capital: 10.5%\n\nFor D-SIBs:\n- CET1: 8.0% plus DSB\n- Tier 1: 9.5% plus DSB\n- Total Capital: 11.5% plus DSB\n\nBUFFER REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Capital Conservation Buffer:\n- 2.5% of Risk-Weighted Assets (must be met with CET1)\n\n2. Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB):\n- Applies to D-SIBs only\n- Range: 0% to 4.0% of RWA\n- Reviewed semi-annually\n\n3. Countercyclical Buffer:\n- Range: 0% to 2.5% of RWA\n- Based on geographic location of exposures\n- Must be met with CET1 capital\n\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS\n\n1. Category III SMSBs:\n- Use Simplified Risk-Based Capital Ratio (SRBCR)\n- Formula: Capital/(Adjusted Total Assets + RWA Operational Risk)\n\n2. Capital Floor Transition:\n- 2023: 65%\n- 2024: 67.5%\n- 2025: 70%\n- 2026+: 72.5%\n\nThe document emphasizes that these requirements serve as triggers for supervisory intervention if institutions fall below their relevant target ratios. All ratios are calculated using risk-weighted assets (RWA) which include credit risk, market risk, and operational risk components.",

Target Capital Ratios\nFor Standard Banks (SMSBs):\n- CET1: 7.0%\n- Tier 1: 8.5%\n- Total Capital: 10.5%\n\nFor Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs):\n- CET1: 8.0% plus Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB)\n- Tier 1: 9.5% plus DSB\n- Total Capital: 11.5% plus DSB\n\n3.

Conservation Ratio Requirements\nWhen CET1 ratios fall within these ranges, the following conservation rules apply:\n- 4.5% - 5.125%: 100% conservation required\n- >5.125% - 5.75%: 80% conservation\n- >5.75% - 6.375%: 60% conservation\n- >6.375% - 7.0%: 40% conservation\n- >7.0%: No conservation required\n\nImportant Notes:\n- All ratios are calculated against Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) unless specified otherwise\n- Institutions must maintain these ratios on a consolidated basis\n- Prior approval from OSFI is required for using internal model-based approaches\n- Distribution restrictions may apply when buffers are drawn down\n- D-SIBs face additional requirements including a 1% CET1 surcharge\n\nThis framework ensures institutions maintain adequate capital levels while providing flexibility through various buffers and conservation requirements based on their systemic importance and market conditions.",
