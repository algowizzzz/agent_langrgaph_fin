Standard Minimum Requirements:\n- CET1: 4.5%\n- Tier 1: 6.0% \n- Total Capital: 8.0%\n\n2. Target Capital Ratios:\nFor SMSBs:\n- CET1: 7.0%\n- Tier 1: 8.5%\n- Total Capital: 10.5%\n\nFor D-SIBs:\n- CET1: 8.0% plus DSB\n- Tier 1: 9.5% plus DSB\n- Total Capital: 11.5% plus DSB\n\nBUFFER REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Capital Conservation Buffer:\n- 2.5% of Risk-Weighted Assets (must be met with CET1)\n\n2. Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB):\n- Applies to D-SIBs only\n- Range: 0% to 4.0% of RWA\n- Reviewed semi-annually\n\n3. Countercyclical Buffer:\n- Range: 0% to 2.5% of RWA\n- Based on geographic location of exposures\n- Must be met with CET1 capital\n\nSPECIAL PROVISIONS\n\n1. Category III SMSBs:\n- Use Simplified Risk-Based Capital Ratio (SRBCR)\n- Formula: Capital/(Adjusted Total Assets + RWA Operational Risk)\n\n2. Capital Floor Transition:\n- 2023: 65%\n- 2024: 67.5%\n- 2025: 70%\n- 2026+: 72.5%\n\nThe document emphasizes that these requirements serve as triggers for supervisory intervention if institutions fall below their relevant target ratios. All ratios are calculated using risk-weighted assets (RWA) which include credit risk, market risk, and operational risk components.",

Minimum Capital Requirements (Base Levels)\n- CET1: 4.5%\n- Tier 1: 6.0% \n- Total Capital: 8.0%\n\n2. Target Capital Ratios\nFor Standard Banks (SMSBs):\n- CET1: 7.0%\n- Tier 1: 8.5%\n- Total Capital: 10.5%\n\nFor Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs):\n- CET1: 8.0% plus Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB)\n- Tier 1: 9.5% plus DSB\n- Total Capital: 11.5% plus DSB\n\n3. Key Buffer Requirements\n- Capital Conservation Buffer: 2.5% of RWA\n- Countercyclical Buffer: 0-2.5% of RWA\n- Domestic Stability Buffer (D-SIBs only): 0-4.0% of RWA\n\n4. Capital Floor Implementation Schedule\n- 2023: 65%\n- 2024: 67.5%\n- 2025: 70%\n- 2026+: 72.5%\n\n5. Conservation Ratio Requirements\nWhen CET1 ratios fall within these ranges, the following conservation rules apply:\n- 4.5% - 5.125%: 100% conservation required\n- >5.125% - 5.75%: 80% conservation\n- >5.75% - 6.375%: 60% conservation\n- >6.375% - 7.0%: 40% conservation\n- >7.0%: No conservation required\n\nImportant Notes:\n- All ratios are calculated against Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) unless specified otherwise\n- Institutions must maintain these ratios on a consolidated basis\n- Prior approval from OSFI is required for using internal model-based approaches\n- Distribution restrictions may apply when buffers are drawn down\n- D-SIBs face additional requirements including a 1% CET1 surcharge\n\nThis framework ensures institutions maintain adequate capital levels while providing flexibility through various buffers and conservation requirements based on their systemic importance and market conditions.",

      "content": "Here's a concise summary of the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline:\n\nThe CAR Guideline, effective November 2023/January 2024, establishes comprehensive capital requirements for Canadian financial institutions. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Scope & Framework\n- Applies to Canadian banks, bank holding companies, and federally regulated trust/loan companies\n- Based on Basel Committee standards\n- Covers both D-SIBs (Domestic Systemically Important Banks) and SMSBs (Small/Medium-Sized Banks)\n\n2. Capital Requirements\n- Three tiers: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2\n- Minimum ratios: 4.5% (CET1), 6.0% (Tier 1), 8.0% (Total Capital)\n- Additional 2.5% capital conservation buffer\n- Countercyclical buffer of 0-2.5% based on market conditions\n\n3. Special Provisions for D-SIBs\n- 1% additional CET1 surcharge\n- Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) of 0-4.0%\n- Higher overall target ratios\n- Enhanced supervision requirements\n\n4. Implementation Features\n- Phased capital floor requirement (65% in 2023 to 72.5% by 2026)\n- Risk-weighted assets calculations covering multiple risk types\n- Regular monitoring and assessment\n- Proportional requirements based on institution size\n\nThe framework emphasizes maintaining adequate capital buffers while balancing standardized requirements with risk-sensitive measures, ensuring overall financial system stability through regular reviews and adjustments.",
