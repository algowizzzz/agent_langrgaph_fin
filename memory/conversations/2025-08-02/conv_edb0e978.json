      "content": "Here's a concise summary of the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline:\n\nThe CAR Guideline, effective November 2023/January 2024, establishes comprehensive capital requirements for Canadian financial institutions. Here are the key points:\n\n1. Scope & Framework\n- Applies to Canadian banks, bank holding companies, and federally regulated trust/loan companies\n- Based on Basel Committee standards\n- Covers both D-SIBs (Domestic Systemically Important Banks) and SMSBs (Small/Medium-Sized Banks)\n\n2. Capital Requirements\n- Three tiers: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2\n- Minimum ratios: 4.5% (CET1), 6.0% (Tier 1), 8.0% (Total Capital)\n- Additional 2.5% capital conservation buffer\n- Countercyclical buffer of 0-2.5% based on market conditions\n\n3. Special Provisions for D-SIBs\n- 1% additional CET1 surcharge\n- Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) of 0-4.0%\n- Higher overall target ratios\n- Enhanced supervision requirements\n\n4. Implementation Features\n- Phased capital floor requirement (65% in 2023 to 72.5% by 2026)\n- Risk-weighted assets calculations covering multiple risk types\n- Regular monitoring and assessment\n- Proportional requirements based on institution size\n\nThe framework emphasizes maintaining adequate capital buffers while balancing standardized requirements with risk-sensitive measures, ensuring overall financial system stability through regular reviews and adjustments.",
