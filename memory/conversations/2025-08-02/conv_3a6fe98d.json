Legal Basis:\n- Established under the Bank Act and Trust and Loan Companies Act\n- Gives the Superintendent authority to direct institutions to increase capital when necessary\n\n2. Framework Structure:\nThe CAR guideline is organized into nine chapters covering:\n- Overview of Risk-based Capital Requirements\n- Definition of Capital\n- Operational Risk\n- Credit Risk\n- Securitization\n- Settlement and Counterparty Risk\n- Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk\n- Market Risk\n\n3. Purpose:\nThe framework serves to:\n- Assess whether institutions maintain adequate capital levels\n- Provide standardized capital requirements based on the Basel capital framework\n- Ensure financial institutions' stability through proper capital management\n\nThis regulatory framework is fundamental to maintaining the stability and security of Canada's financial system by ensuring institutions maintain appropriate capital levels relative to their risks.",
