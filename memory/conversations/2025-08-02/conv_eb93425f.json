Here are the key components:\n\n1. Approval Requirements\n- Must obtain explicit prior approval from regulatory authorities (OSFI)\n- Need to demonstrate compliance through:\n  * Out-of-sample back-testing\n  * Parallel reporting\n  * Ongoing qualitative and quantitative assessments\n\n2. Implementation Criteria\n- Must implement approved approaches (AIRB or FIRB) across approximately 80% of consolidated exposures\n- Follows a structured phase-in schedule with progressive requirements\n- Quarterly compliance monitoring after initial approval\n\n3. Verification Standards\n- Must satisfy internal model regime requirements\n- Ongoing compliance monitoring by regulatory authorities\n- Regular assessment of implementation progress\n- Back-testing validation of results\n\n4. Conditional Approval Process\n- \"Approval with conditions\" may be granted if full requirements aren't initially met\n- Higher initial capital requirements may apply until full compliance is achieved\n- Regular review and adjustment of approval conditions based on implementation progress\n\nThis framework ensures thorough verification of test fixes while maintaining regulatory compliance and systematic validation throughout the process.\n\nNote: Implementation should align with effective dates of November 2023 or January 2024, depending on the institution's fiscal year end (October 31 or December 31).",
