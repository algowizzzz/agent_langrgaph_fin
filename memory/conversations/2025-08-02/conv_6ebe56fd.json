Without access to both documents' content, I cannot provide a detailed comparison of what each one mentions.\n\nFrom the limited information provided, I can see that:\n- Document 1 appears to be Chapter 1 and contains content about capital requirements\n- Document 2 appears to be Chapter 7 and covers settlement risk\n\nTo provide you with an accurate and thorough comparison, I would need:\n1. The complete content of both documents\n2. Access to their full text and context\n3. Any specific aspects you'd like me to focus on in the comparison\n\nOnce you share both documents, I can help you by:\n- Analyzing their specific contents\n- Identifying key differences and similarities\n- Explaining how they relate to each other\n- Providing a detailed breakdown of what each document covers\n\nWould you please share both documents so I can provide the comprehensive comparison you're looking for?",
