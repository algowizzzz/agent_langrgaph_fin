      "content": "Here's a clear explanation of the CET ratio and its role in corporate finance:\n\nThe Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is a fundamental financial metric that measures a bank's core equity capital in relation to its risk-weighted assets. It serves as a key indicator of a financial institution's stability and resilience.\n\nThe ratio is calculated as:\nCET1 Ratio = (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets) Ã— 100%\n\nKey Components:\n1. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital includes:\n- Common shares\n- Retained earnings\n- Other comprehensive income\n- Qualifying minority interests\n- Regulatory adjustments\n\n2. Risk-Weighted Assets:\n- Assets are weighted based on their risk level\n- Higher-risk assets require more capital backing\n- Lower-risk assets require less capital backing\n\nRelationship to Corporate Finance:\nThe CET ratio is crucial in corporate finance because it:\n- Serves as a key measure of financial institution stability\n- Helps assess a bank's ability to withstand financial stress\n- Is used by regulators to ensure banks maintain adequate capital reserves\n- Influences a bank's ability to lend and conduct business operations\n\nThis ratio is particularly important for financial institutions and is closely monitored by regulators, investors, and stakeholders as part of overall financial risk assessment and management.",
