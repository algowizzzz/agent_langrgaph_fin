I cannot provide specific guidance about system testing after Excel file removal since this information is not present in the provided documentation.\n\nIf you need information about testing a system after Excel file removal, you may want to:\n\n1. Consult your system's technical documentation\n2. Review any existing test procedures specific to your system\n3. Work with your IT team or system administrator\n4. Consider standard testing protocols such as:\n   - Functionality testing\n   - Data integrity checks\n   - System integration testing\n   - User acceptance testing\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Provide information about the finance and risk content that is available in the document\n2. Help you formulate more specific questions about system testing\n3. Point you to appropriate resources for system testing procedures\n\nPlease let me know how I can best assist you with your specific needs.",
