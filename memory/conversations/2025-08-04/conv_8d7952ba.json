It represents the possibility that actual outcomes may deviate from expected results due to various factors such as market volatility, economic changes, or unforeseen events.\n\nThere are several key aspects of risk to understand:\n\n1. Measurement\n- Risk is typically measured by analyzing both the likelihood and magnitude of potential deviations from expected outcomes\n- It can be quantified to help make informed decisions\n\n2. Major Types of Financial Risk\n- Market Risk: Related to price fluctuations in financial markets\n- Credit Risk: The possibility of loan defaults\n- Liquidity Risk: Difficulty in converting assets to cash\n- Operational Risk: Risks from process or system failures\n\n3. Key Characteristics\n- Risk is inherent in most financial decisions\n- It requires careful management and assessment\n- Higher risks are often associated with potential for higher returns\n- Risk can arise from multiple sources simultaneously\n\nUnderstanding risk is fundamental to making sound financial decisions, as it allows individuals and organizations to better evaluate opportunities and protect against potential losses.
