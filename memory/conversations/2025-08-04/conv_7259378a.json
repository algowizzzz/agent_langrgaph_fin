      "content": "The CET Ratio (Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio) is a key financial metric that measures a bank's core capital strength in relation to its risk-weighted assets. It's expressed as a percentage and calculated using this formula:\n\nCET Ratio = (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets) Ã— 100%\n\nKey components of the ratio include:\n\n1. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital:\n- Common shares\n- Retained earnings\n- Other comprehensive income\n- Qualifying minority interests\n- Regulatory adjustments\n\n2. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA):\n- Bank assets that are weighted based on their risk level\n- Higher-risk assets require more capital backing\n- Calculated using standardized approaches or internal models\n\nThe CET Ratio is important because it:\n- Serves as the primary measure of a bank's financial strength\n- Acts as a crucial indicator for regulators and investors\n- Forms part of the Basel III international banking standards\n\nThis ratio is one of the most important metrics in banking regulation, helping ensure banks maintain adequate capital reserves relative to their risk exposure.",
