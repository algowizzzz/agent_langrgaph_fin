      "content": "Based on the provided information, I'll provide a comprehensive analysis of regulatory requirements related to wrong-way risk (WWR).\n\nABSTRACT SUMMARY\nThe regulatory framework establishes specific requirements for identifying, monitoring, and calculating capital requirements for wrong-way risk in counterparty credit risk exposures. The regulations distinguish between general and specific wrong-way risk, with detailed guidelines for risk management and capital treatment.\n\nKEY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\n1. Wrong-Way Risk Classifications:\n- General Wrong-Way Risk (GWWR): Occurs when the probability of counterparty default positively correlates with general market risk factors\n- Specific Wrong-Way Risk (SWWR): Exists when there's a direct link between exposure to a counterparty and the probability of their default\n\n2. Monitoring and Management Requirements:\n- Institutions must have procedures to identify, monitor, and control wrong-way risk exposures\n- Regular reporting and review mechanisms must be established\n- Documentation of identified wrong-way risk cases is required\n\n3. Capital Treatment:\n- Specific capital calculations are required for exposures with wrong-way risk\n- Higher capital requirements may apply for transactions with significant wrong-way risk\n- Special consideration for collateral and guarantees in wrong-way risk scenarios\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe regulatory requirements for wrong-way risk emphasize the importance of robust risk management frameworks and appropriate capital allocation. Institutions must implement comprehensive systems to identify, monitor, and manage both general and specific wrong-way risk, with particular attention to capital adequacy and risk mitigation strategies.\n\nNote: The analysis appears to be based on Chapter 7 of the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guidelines, effective November 2023/January 2024, though complete details of all regulations may require reference to additional chapters or documents.",
