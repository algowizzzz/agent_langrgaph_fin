      "content": "Based on the test execution debug information, I can help identify and explain the key issue:\n\nThe test execution is failing due to a missing data file that's required for the test to run. Specifically:\n\nKey Details:\n- Error: Unable to locate required CSV file containing business test data\n- Missing File: 20250801_215110_09205507-73f4-4fec-8792-3cdb156bcd39_test_business_data.csv\n- Notable: The timestamp in the filename (2025) suggests this may be related to future test data\n\nDebug Recommendations:\n1. Verify the correct file path and location where the test is expecting to find the CSV\n2. Check if the test data file exists and has the exact expected filename\n3. Ensure proper file permissions are set\n4. Review the test's data dependency setup\n\nTo resolve this:\n- Locate or recreate the missing test data file\n- Place it in the correct directory path\n- Verify the naming convention matches exactly what the test expects\n- Consider implementing better error handling for missing test data\n\nThis appears to be a straightforward file dependency issue that can be resolved by ensuring the required test data is present and properly accessible.",
