The system indicates that the requested file 'bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf' could not be found, though there appears to be a similar document with a longer filename in the system.\n\nTo proceed with a proper text metrics analysis, I recommend:\n\n1. Document Access:\n- Verify the exact filename you're trying to analyze\n- Ensure the document is properly uploaded to the system\n- Try accessing the similar document identified: '20250804_165511_7d4467fc-7110-4cff-a4f4-f31e40cd2387_bmo_ar2024_MDA.pdf'\n\n2. Analysis Specifications:\nOnce the document is accessible, please specify which text metrics you'd like to analyze, such as:\n- Readability scores\n- Word frequency\n- Sentence structure\n- Document length\n- Key phrase density\n- Linguistic patterns\n\nI'll be happy to provide a comprehensive text metrics analysis once you've confirmed the document access and specified your metrics of interest. This will ensure you receive the most valuable and accurate analysis possible.\n\nWould you like me to attempt the analysis again with the correct document name, or would you prefer guidance on accessing the document first?",
