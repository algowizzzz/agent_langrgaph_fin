Core Capital Structure\n- Sets minimum capital ratios: CET1 (4.5%), Tier 1 (6.0%), and Total (8.0%)\n\n2. Buffer Framework\n- Capital Conservation Buffer: 2.5% of RWA\n- Countercyclical Buffer: 0-2.5% of RWA\n- D-SIB Surcharge: 1% for six designated Canadian banks\n- Domestic Stability Buffer: 0-4.0% of RWA for D-SIBs\n\n3. Target Capital Ratios\nFor Standard Banks (SMSBs):\n- CET1: 7.0%\n- Tier 1: 8.5%\n- Total: 10.5%\n\nFor Designated Banks (D-SIBs):\n- Higher requirements with additional DSB requirements\n\n4. Supervision Framework\n- Enhanced oversight for D-SIBs including:\n- International supervision\n- Increased monitoring\n- Regular stress testing\n- Recovery planning\n- Enhanced disclosure requirements\n\n5. Implementation\n- Phased approach\n- Regular review of buffer levels\n- Comprehensive disclosure requirements\n- Alignment with Basel Framework\n\nThis framework represents a balanced approach to capital adequacy, combining international standards with domestic requirements while providing specific provisions for different types of banking institutions.",
