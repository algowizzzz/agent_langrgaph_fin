Multi-Tiered Capital Framework\n- Core minimum requirements: CET1 (4.5%), Tier 1 (6.0%), and Total Capital (8.0%)\n- Additional 2.5% capital conservation buffer\n- Countercyclical buffer ranging from 0-2.5%\n- Special requirements for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs)\n\n2. D-SIB Specific Requirements\n- Applies to six major Canadian banks (BMO, Scotiabank, CIBC, National Bank, RBC, TD)\n- 1% CET1 surcharge\n- Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) of 0-4.0% of risk-weighted assets\n- Higher target ratios: minimum 8% CET1, 9.5% Tier 1, 11.5% Total Capital\n\n3. Flexible Supervisory Framework\n- Geographic implementation of countercyclical buffer\n- Semi-annual DSB reviews\n- Enhanced supervision for D-SIBs\n- Regular stress testing requirements\n\n4. Risk Management Features\n- Automatic distribution constraints when capital falls below thresholds\n- Specific provisions for capital restoration\n- Comprehensive disclosure requirements\n- Tools to address both institution-specific and systemic risks\n\nThis framework demonstrates a robust approach to maintaining financial stability through careful capital management and regulatory oversight, with particular attention to systemically important institutions.",

Core Strategies:\n- Diversification of investments\n- Hedging against potential losses\n- Appropriate insurance coverage\n- Regular risk assessment and monitoring\n\n3. Implementation Approach:\n- Evaluating both probability and impact of risks\n- Developing comprehensive management strategies\n- Maintaining balance between risk and potential returns\n- Making informed decisions based on risk analysis\n\nThe effectiveness of risk management lies in its systematic approach to protecting financial stability while optimizing returns. Organizations and individuals who implement proper risk management techniques are better positioned to achieve their financial objectives while minimizing potential negative impacts.\n\nFor those looking to develop their risk management expertise, consulting financial advisors or studying authoritative financial resources can provide valuable additional guidance and insights.",
