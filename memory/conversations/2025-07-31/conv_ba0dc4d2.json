Here's a comprehensive explanation:\n\nAt its core, risk represents the possibility that actual outcomes may deviate from expected results. It can be broken down into several key types:\n\n1. Market Risk: Related to price fluctuations in financial markets\n2. Credit Risk: The possibility of defaults on loans or financial obligations\n3. Liquidity Risk: Challenges in converting assets to cash when needed\n4. Operational Risk: Potential failures in internal processes or systems\n\nRisk is an inherent part of decision-making and can arise from various sources:\n- Market volatility\n- Economic changes\n- Unexpected events\n- System failures\n\nUnderstanding risk is crucial because it allows individuals and organizations to:\n- Make more informed financial decisions\n- Implement protective strategies like diversification\n- Use risk management tools such as hedging or insurance\n- Better protect assets against potential losses\n\nThe key to dealing with risk effectively lies not in avoiding it completely (which is often impossible), but in understanding, measuring, and managing it appropriately for your specific situation.",

Multi-Tiered Capital Framework\n- Core minimum requirements: CET1 (4.5%), Tier 1 (6.0%), and Total Capital (8.0%)\n- Additional 2.5% capital conservation buffer\n- Countercyclical buffer ranging from 0-2.5%\n- Special requirements for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs)\n\n2. D-SIB Specific Requirements\n- Applies to six major Canadian banks (BMO, Scotiabank, CIBC, National Bank, RBC, TD)\n- 1% CET1 surcharge\n- Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) of 0-4.0% of risk-weighted assets\n- Higher target ratios: minimum 8% CET1, 9.5% Tier 1, 11.5% Total Capital\n\n3. Flexible Supervisory Framework\n- Geographic implementation of countercyclical buffer\n- Semi-annual DSB reviews\n- Enhanced supervision for D-SIBs\n- Regular stress testing requirements\n\n4. Risk Management Features\n- Automatic distribution constraints when capital falls below thresholds\n- Specific provisions for capital restoration\n- Comprehensive disclosure requirements\n- Tools to address both institution-specific and systemic risks\n\nThis framework demonstrates a robust approach to maintaining financial stability through careful capital management and regulatory oversight, with particular attention to systemically important institutions.",
