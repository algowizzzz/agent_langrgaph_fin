      "content": "Let me help you compare these two documents based on their core focus areas:\n\nDocument A covers Financial Risk Management, which is a broader, more comprehensive topic that typically deals with overall financial risk oversight and management strategies across an organization. This document likely discusses various approaches to identifying, assessing, and mitigating different types of financial risks.\n\nDocument B specifically focuses on Credit Risk Assessment, which is actually a specialized subset of financial risk management. This document appears to concentrate specifically on procedures for evaluating credit-related risks, particularly in relation to assessing borrower creditworthiness.\n\nKey Differences:\n- Scope: Document A has a wider scope covering multiple risk types, while Document B deals specifically with credit risk\n- Focus: Document A likely discusses broad risk management strategies, while Document B concentrates on specific assessment procedures\n- Application: Document A appears to be more strategic in nature, while Document B is more procedural\n\nHowever, I should note that without access to the full content of both documents, this comparison is based on their high-level topics only. If you'd like a more detailed analysis, I'd be happy to review the complete documents and provide a more thorough comparison.",
