Purpose: Theoretical education vs. practical performance measurement\n2. Scope: Broad principles vs. specific organizational metrics\n3. Approach: Conceptual frameworks vs. quantitative results\n\nNotable Complementary Elements:\n- Document 2 shows how the theoretical principles from Document 1 are implemented in practice\n- The organizational structure in Document 2 reflects the theoretical categories outlined in Document 1\n- Risk management concepts from Document 1 are demonstrated through actual departmental operations in Document 2\n\nThis comparison illustrates the relationship between financial theory and practical application within a business context, showing how theoretical principles translate into measurable organizational outcomes.",

Tier 1 Capital, which includes:\n- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital\n- Additional Tier 1 capital\n\n2. Tier 2 Capital\n\nThis structure forms the foundation for calculating total capital ratios and meeting regulatory capital requirements. The specific criteria for these capital elements, along with their various limits, restrictions, and regulatory adjustments, are detailed in Chapter 2 of the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR).\n\nThe importance of these components is reflected in the minimum capital requirements, which specify:\n- CET1: 4.5%\n- Tier 1: 6.0%\n- Total Capital: 8.0%\n\nIt's worth noting that institutions must maintain additional capital buffers beyond these minimum requirements, such as the capital conservation buffer and, for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), the Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB). However, these buffers are supplementary to the core components that make up total capital.",

The available document content only contains a basic introduction to finance and its broad categories (personal, corporate, and public finance).

Banking regulatory guidelines (Basel framework)\n2. Risk management documentation\n3. Financial institution policy manuals\n4. Credit risk assessment guidelines\n\nWould you like me to provide information about RWA calculation from other authoritative sources?",
