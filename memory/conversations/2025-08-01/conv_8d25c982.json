      "content": "Based on the provided documentation, total capital consists of two main tiers with several components:\n\n1. Tier 1 Capital, which includes:\n- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital\n- Additional Tier 1 capital\n\n2. Tier 2 Capital\n\nThis structure forms the foundation for calculating total capital ratios and meeting regulatory capital requirements. The specific criteria for these capital elements, along with their various limits, restrictions, and regulatory adjustments, are detailed in Chapter 2 of the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR).\n\nThe importance of these components is reflected in the minimum capital requirements, which specify:\n- CET1: 4.5%\n- Tier 1: 6.0%\n- Total Capital: 8.0%\n\nIt's worth noting that institutions must maintain additional capital buffers beyond these minimum requirements, such as the capital conservation buffer and, for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), the Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB). However, these buffers are supplementary to the core components that make up total capital.",

Capital Conservation Buffer:\n- 2.5% of RWA\n- Must be met with CET1 capital\n- Restrictions on capital distributions apply when buffer is breached\n\n2. D-SIB Surcharge (for Domestic Systemically Important Banks):\n- Additional 1% CET1 requirement\n- Makes target CET1 ratio 8.0% for D-SIBs (vs 7.0% for other banks)\n\n3. Countercyclical Buffer:\n- 0-2.5% range\n- Set by OSFI based on credit cycle conditions\n- Must be met with CET1 capital\n- Weighted by geographic location of exposures\n\n4. Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) for D-SIBs:\n- Range of 0-4.0% of RWA\n- Must be met with CET1 capital\n- Level reviewed semi-annually by OSFI\n\nTarget Ratios Summary:\nStandard Banks (SMSBs):\n- CET1 target: 7.0%\n- Tier 1 target: 8.5%\n- Total Capital target: 10.5%\n\nD-SIBs:\n- CET1 target: 8.0% plus DSB\n- Tier 1 target: 9.5% plus DSB\n- Total Capital target: 11.5% plus DSB\n\nThe requirements follow a graduated approach where breaching buffer levels results in increasingly restrictive limitations on capital distributions like dividends and share buybacks. All ratios are calculated by dividing the relevant capital measure by total risk-weighted assets.",
