Data & Compliance Risks\n- Privacy regulation compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)\n- Information security requirements (ISO 27001)\n- Authentication and authorization challenges\n- Protection of sensitive document content\n\n2. Technical & Operational Risks\n- Dependencies on multiple platforms (FastAPI, Next.js, OpenAI GPT)\n- Third-party service reliance\n- Performance issues under high loads\n- 20% potential failure rate in processing\n- Large-scale document handling challenges\n\n3. Implementation & Processing Risks\n- Multiple file format handling complexities\n- Metadata extraction challenges\n- Document processing accuracy concerns\n- AI response validation for business decisions\n\n4. Financial Risks\n- Initial development cost ($50,000)\n- Annual operating costs ($12,000)\n- 18-month break-even timeline\n- ROI management (300% projected)\n\n5. Maintenance & Support Risks\n- Regular monitoring requirements\n- Ongoing maintenance needs\n- Support response capabilities\n- System optimization demands\n\nThese risk factors require careful management and regular assessment, with particular attention needed for compliance, performance, and financial aspects. Implementation of appropriate mitigation strategies is recommended for each category to ensure system stability and success.",

While the document mentions four main risk categories (Data Privacy, Security, Performance, and Accuracy), their relative criticality is not specified.\n\nTo properly assess which risk is most critical, we would need:\n1. Severity ratings for each risk\n2. Probability assessments\n3. Impact analysis\n4. Stakeholder input on risk prioritization\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Provide more details about each of the four risk categories mentioned?\n- Help identify criteria for evaluating risk criticality?\n- Connect you with relevant stakeholders who could provide risk prioritization guidance?\n\nFor a meaningful assessment of risk criticality, I recommend consulting with your project stakeholders and risk management team to establish clear risk rankings based on your specific context and requirements.",
