Data & Compliance Risks\n- Privacy regulation compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)\n- Information security requirements (ISO 27001)\n- Authentication and authorization challenges\n- Protection of sensitive document content\n\n2. Technical & Operational Risks\n- Dependencies on multiple platforms (FastAPI, Next.js, OpenAI GPT)\n- Third-party service reliance\n- Performance issues under high loads\n- 20% potential failure rate in processing\n- Large-scale document handling challenges\n\n3. Implementation & Processing Risks\n- Multiple file format handling complexities\n- Metadata extraction challenges\n- Document processing accuracy concerns\n- AI response validation for business decisions\n\n4. Financial Risks\n- Initial development cost ($50,000)\n- Annual operating costs ($12,000)\n- 18-month break-even timeline\n- ROI management (300% projected)\n\n5. Maintenance & Support Risks\n- Regular monitoring requirements\n- Ongoing maintenance needs\n- Support response capabilities\n- System optimization demands\n\nThese risk factors require careful management and regular assessment, with particular attention needed for compliance, performance, and financial aspects. Implementation of appropriate mitigation strategies is recommended for each category to ensure system stability and success.",
