Risk is the uncertainty or potential for loss that exists in financial decisions or investments. 
It represents the possibility that actual outcomes may deviate from expected results due to various 
factors such as market volatility, economic changes, or unforeseen events.

There are several key aspects of risk to understand:

1. Measurement
- Risk is typically measured by analyzing both the likelihood and magnitude of potential deviations 
  from expected outcomes
- It can be quantified to help make informed decisions

2. Major Types of Financial Risk
- Market Risk: Related to price fluctuations in financial markets
- Credit Risk: The possibility of loan defaults
- Liquidity Risk: Difficulty in converting assets to cash
- Operational Risk: Risks from process or system failures

3. Key Characteristics
- Risk is inherent in most financial decisions
- It requires careful management and assessment
- Higher risks are often associated with potential for higher returns
- Risk can arise from multiple sources simultaneously

Understanding risk is fundamental to making sound financial decisions, as it allows individuals and 
organizations to better evaluate opportunities and protect against potential losses. Effective risk 
management involves identifying, measuring, and developing strategies to minimize or control these 
uncertainties while pursuing financial objectives.

The CET Ratio (Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio) is a key financial metric that measures a bank's core capital 
strength in relation to its risk-weighted assets. It's expressed as a percentage and calculated using 
this formula:

CET Ratio = (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets) √ó 100%

Key components of the ratio include:

1. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital:
- Common shares
- Retained earnings
- Other comprehensive income
- Qualifying minority interests
- Regulatory adjustments

2. Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA):
- Bank assets that are weighted based on their risk level
- Higher-risk assets require more capital backing
- Calculated using standardized approaches or internal models

The CET Ratio is important because it:
- Serves as the primary measure of a bank's financial strength
- Acts as a crucial indicator for regulators and investors
- Forms part of the Basel III international banking standards

This ratio is one of the most important metrics in banking regulation, helping ensure banks maintain 
adequate capital reserves relative to their risk exposure.
